Methods

This section starts by describing candidates who were included in this study. It then presents survey tools
used to collect data and methods used to analyze and report data.

Participants
This study included over 3,600 candidates worldwide who completed their graduate business education
between 2010 and 2021. GMAC surveyed these candidates before and after they completed graduate
business school about their motivation to pursue GME, their employment characteristics at each time, and
their evaluation of their business school experience by their personal, professional, and financial goals.
Among them, 40% were women. The median age was 27 at the pre-GME survey with an interquartile range
of 24-30. These candidates came from 113 countries on all 6 populated continents. They attended 728
graduate business schools or universities across 66 countries. Table 1 provides demographic characteristics
of candidates included in this study.

Findings

This section starts by presenting what inspires an individual to consider graduate business school. It
continues to describe how the successful completion of a business degree moves personal, professional,
and financial levers in an individual’s life. Finally, this section provides results about candidates’ evaluation of
the value received from their GME experience.


Motivations

Most candidates pursue GME for career advancement, personal growth, and better income

Candidates reported a variety of motivations to pursue GME (see Figure 1). Two-thirds or more pursued
GME to increase their job opportunities and salary potential, develop business knowledge and skills, and
accelerate their current career paths. About half completed GME to change career paths (e.g., job function
and industry) and expand their personal network. About one-third were motivated by the opportunity for
international employment and the desire to develop entrepreneurship skills by managing their own business.
One-quarter reported they pursued GME to gain respect and increase their impact on communities.

  Findings (cont.)

  Candidate motivation varies by background characteristics

  Women were more likely to pursue GME to increase their job opportunities than men (see Figure 2).
  Men were more likely to pursue GME to develop personal networks, develop entrepreneurship skills,
  and own their own business than women.

  A higher percentage of candidates from Asia/Pacific Islands were motivated to develop
  entrepreneurship skills and own their own business than candidates from Europe and North America.
  Candidates from North America were more likely to pursue GME to increase their job opportunities
  and salary potential, develop business knowledge and skills, and accelerate career path than candidates
  from other regions of the world. Candidates from Latin America and Europe were more likely to be
  motivated by opportunities for international employment than candidates from the rest of the world.
  North American candidates were the least interested in international opportunities compared with
  candidates from all other regions. See Appendix for details of results by background characteristic
