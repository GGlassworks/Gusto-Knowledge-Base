losses and at the same time maintain its position as a responsible entity within the society.

 CORPORATE ACCOUNTING & FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

                            PART I : CORPORATE ACCOUNTING (60 MARKS)

 Lesson 1 – Introduction to Accounting
Accounting is a very old concept – as old as money. A description of proper keeping of accounts is also found in
‘Arthashastra” written by Kautilya. However, it has developed with the passage of time to meet the requirements
and challenges of ever – growing society. The modern-day accounting concept based on double entry system
was originated by Luco Pacioli in Italy. Though the act of accounting is very old, in recent times it has acquired
special significance because of rapidly growing economy, cut-throat competition, expanding markets and
increasing production and changes in technology.
In this lesson, we will throw light on the basic concepts of accounting, types of accounts, accounting principles,
conventions, accounting concepts, meaning of double entry system and the rules of debit & credit on which the
entire concept of accounting is based.
Accounting process involves identification and analysis of financial transactions. These transactions are
recorded, classified and summarised in a systematic manner to give useful information. Thus, accounting
process starts with the recording of business transactions in monetary terms, in the primary books of accounts.
For recording business transactions, it is necessary that these transactions are evidenced by proper source
documents like cash memoes, purchase bills, sales bills, counterfoils of cheques issued, salary slips etc. From
these source documents, transactions are recorded in the books of accounts which are the first and major
step in accounting. It is the basis of accounting as entire future process would depend upon this recording of
transactions. In this lesson, we will know about recording transactions in primary books like Journal and other
subsidiary books, posting in ledger and then preparation of trial balance.

 Lesson 2 – Introduction to Corporate Accounting
There is no legal obligation for sole proprietorship and partnership firm to prepare final accounts, but companies
have statutory obligations to keep proper books of account and to prepare its final accounts every year in
the manner as prescribed in the Companies Act. Chapter IX, Sections 128 to 138 of the Companies Act, 2013
deals with the legal provisions relating to the Accounts of Companies. Final accounts of a company consist of
balance sheet as at the end of the accounting period and profit and loss account for that period. Section 129
of the Companies Act, 2013 prescribes the form and contents of balance sheet and profit and loss account of a
company. Balance sheet of a company shall be prepared according to Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013.
The Schedule III sets out the minimum requirements for disclosure on the face of the Balance Sheet, and the
Statement of Profit and Loss (hereinafter referred to as “Financial Statements”) and Notes. Statement of Profit
& Loss of a company shall be prepared according to Part II of Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013. Section
129(1) of the Companies Act 2013, states that the financial statements shall give a true and fair view of the state
of affairs of the company or companies, comply with the accounting standards notified under section 133 and
shall be in the form provided for different class or classes of companies in Schedule III.

 Lesson 3 – Accounting Standards (AS)
Accounting Standards (AS) are written policy documents by expert accounting body or by government or other
regulatory body covering the aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of accounting

                                                                                                              (vii)
transactions in the financial statements. The ostensible purpose of the standard setting bodies is to promote
the dissemination of timely and useful financial information to investors and certain other parties having an
interest in the company’s economic performance. Accounting standards reduce the accounting alternatives
in the presentation of financial statements within the bounds of rationality, thereby ensuing comparability of
financial statements of different enterprises. This lesson covers the brief about the Accounting Standard, the
International Financial Reporting Standard and also list out the difference between Accounting Standard and
IFRS.

 Lesson 4 – Accounting for Share Capital

 Lesson 5 – Accounting for Debentures
Equity sources of financing are however not always sufficient to meet the ever growing needs of the corporate
expansion and growth. Hence, corporates turn to debt financing through financial institutions, commercial banks
or by issuing debt instruments either through the route of private placement or by offering the same for public
subscription. Owing tax shield provided by debt instruments, the debt financing not only helps in reducing
the cost of capital but also helps in designing appropriate capital structure of the company. This lesson deals

 Lesson 8 – Financial Statement Analysis
Financial statements are compilation of financial data, collected and classified in a systematic manner according
to the accounting principles, to assess the financial position of an enterprise as regards to its profitability,
operational efficiency, long and short – term solvency and growth potential.
Financial statements are basic and formal means through which management of an enterprise make public
communication of financial information along with select quantitative details. They are structured financial
representation of the financial position, performance and cash flows of an enterprise. Many users rely on the
general purpose financial statements as the major source of financial information and therefore, financial
statements should be prepared and presented in accordance with their requirement. That does not undermine
the dependence of the general users on the information contents of the financial statements.

 Lesson 9 – Cash Flows
Cash flow statement is additional information to user of financial statement. This statement exhibits the flow of
incoming and outgoing cash and cash equivalent. It assesses the ability of the enterprise to generate cash and
utilize cash. Cash Flow Statement is one of the tools for assessing the liquidity and solvency of the enterprise.
Cash Flow Statement is considered to be a summarized statement showing sources of Cash Inflows and
application of cash outflows of an enterprise during a particular period of time. It is prepared on the basis of the
published data as disclosed by the Financial Statement of two different financial periods. It is an essential tool
for managerial decision-making. Cash Flow reports the management Net Cash Flow (i.e. cash inflow less cash

                                                                                                                (ix)
outflow or vice versa) from each activity of the enterprise as well as of the overall business of the enterprise.
The management of the enterprise gets a picture of movement of cash resources from the Cash Flow Statement
and can assess the stronger and weaker area of movement of cash for different activities of the business for
drawing up the future planning.

 Lesson 10 – Forecasting Financial Statements

includes
      l   Balance Sheet as at the end of the financial year,
      l   Profit and Loss account, or (In the case of a company carrying on any activity not for profit, an income
          and expenditure account for the financial year),
      l   Cash Flow Statement for the financial year,
      l   Statement of Changes in Equity, if applicable, and
      l   Any explanatory note annexed to, or forming part of, any document.
Financial Statements shall be considered as horoscope if one knows how to read and analyze it then probably
by addressing the various early warning signal available in statements would have helped to great extent.
Financial Forecasting is a process of estimating or predicting a company’s financial future by examining
historical performance of data like revenue, cash flow, expenses, or sales. It is at the heart of driving business
performance and stakeholder’s confidence. This lesson covers the Forecasting of Balance Sheet, Profit and

                              PART II : FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT (40 MARKS)

 Lesson 11 – Introduction
This lesson covers the nature, scope and objectives of financial management, risk-return and value of the
firm, objective of the firm: profit maximisation vs. wealth maximisation and emerging role of finance managers.
Financial Management deals with procurement of funds and its effective utilizations in the business. It is
concerned with investment, financing and dividend decisions in relation to objectives of the company. Financial
management is very important for an organisation as it brings economic growth and development through
investment, financing, dividend and risk management decision which help companies to undertake better
projects. Lack of financial management in business will lead to losses and closure of business.

 Lesson 12 – Time Value of Money
Time value of money is the quintessence in the formulation of financial decisions, especially in case of capital
expenditure and long-term investments related decisions. Compounding and discounting are two pillars of time
value of money. Now, depending upon the scenarios, cash inflows and outflows may take different forms, such
as cash outflow in lump-sum at present and inflow in lump-sum in future, cash outflow and inflow in the form of
annuities in the future etc.
In view of the mentioned facts, this lesson elucidated the concepts of time value of money, the power of compounding,
concept of annuity, application of the various tables, i.e., Present Value Interest Factor, Future Value Interest Factor,
Present Value Interest Factor of Annuity, Future Value of an Annuity and other pertinent concepts.

This lesson covers capital budgeting process, its need and importance, kinds of capital budgeting decisions,
capital expenditure control, capital rationing, various methods of capital budgeting- non discounted and
discounted cash flow techniques, risk evaluation and sensitivity analysis, simulation for risk evaluation and
some case studies on capital budgeting. Capital budgeting refers to long-term planning for proposed capital
outlays and their financing. Thus, it includes both raising of long-term funds as well as their utilisation. It may,
thus, be defined as the firm’s formal process for acquisition and investment of capital. Capital budgeting requires
use of various methods including statistical techniques which have been discussed in the chapter.

 Lesson 14 – Cost of Capital
A business requires funds to purchase fixed assets like land and building, plant and machinery, furniture etc.
These assets may be regarded as the foundation of a business. The cost of capital is the required rate of return
that a firm must achieve in order to cover the cost of generating funds in the marketplace. It is used as a discount
rate in determining the present value of future cash flows associated with capital projects. In this lesson we will
study Sources of Long Term Finance, cost of capital, factors affecting the cost of capital, calculation of cost of
capital of for different sources of finance, calculation of weighted cost of capital and marginal cost of capital.

 Lesson 15 – Capital Structure
Capital Structure of a firm is a reflection of the overall investment and financing strategy of the firm. It shows
how much reliance is being placed by the firm on external sources of finance and how much internal accruals
are being used to finance expansions. Optimal capital structure means arrangement of various components
of the structure in tune with both the long-term and short term objectives of the firm. This lesson comprises of
nature, scope and significance of capital structure, factors affecting capital structure, capital structure vis a vis

valuation, theories of capital structure, types of leverage – operating leverage, financial leverage, combined
leverage, EBIT-EPS analysis and effect of leverages on return on equity.

 Lesson 16 – Dividend Decisions
Dividend policy determines what portion of earnings will be paid out to stock holders and what portion will be
retained in the business to finance long-term growth. Dividend decision is one of the crucial parts of the financial
manager, as it determines the amount available for financing the organization long term growth and it plays very
important part in the financial management. This lesson includes types of dividend policies, determinants and
constraints of dividend policy, type/ forms of dividend, different dividend theories – Walter’s Model, Gordon’s
Model, Modigliani-Miller Hypothesis of Dividend Irrelevance Policy etc.

 Lesson 17 – Working Capital Management
The capital which is required to finance current assets is called working capital. It is the capital of a business
which is used to carry out day-to-day business operations of a firm. Working capital is vital for the proper and
smooth functioning of an organisation. Therefore, it is very necessary for a corporate professional to know
about management of different constituents of working capital. In this lesson we will study the meaning, types,

 INTRODUCTION
Business is the activity of making one’s living or making money by producing or buying and selling products
(such as goods and services). It is also “any activity or enterprise entered into with the motive of earning profits
and maximization of the wealth for owners. No business can run in isolation. Largely, the business activity is
carried out by people coming together with a purpose to serve a common cause. This term is often referred to
as an organization, which could be in different forms such as sole proprietorship, partnership, corporate body,
etc.
    l   Sole proprietorship: A sole proprietorship, also known as a sole trader, is owned by one person and
        operates for their benefit. All assets of the business belong to a sole proprietor, including, for example,
        a computer infrastructure, any inventory, manufacturing equipment, or retail fixtures, as well as any real
        property owned by the sole proprietor.
    l   Partnership: A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships,
        each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three most prevalent
        types of for-profit partnerships are general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability
        partnerships.
    l   Corporation: The owners of a corporation have limited liability and the business has a separate legal
        personality from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned, and
        they can organize either for profit or as nonprofit organizations.
    l   Co-operative: Often referred to as a “co-op”, a co-operative is a limited-liability business that can
        organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members,
        not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority.
    l   Franchises: A franchise is a system in which entrepreneurs purchase the rights to open and run a
        business from a larger corporation. Franchising in the United States is widespread and is a major
        economic powerhouse.
    l   A company limited by guarantee: Commonly used where companies are formed for non-commercial
        purposes, such as clubs or charities. The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal)
        amounts if the company goes into insolvent liquidation, but otherwise, they have no economic rights in
        relation to the company. A company limited by guarantee may be with or without having share capital.
    l   A company limited by shares: The most common form of the company used for business ventures.
        Specifically, a limited company is a “company in which the liability of each shareholder is limited to
        the amount individually invested” with corporations being “the most common example of a limited
        company.”
    l   A company limited by guarantee with a share capital: A hybrid entity, usually used where the
        company is formed for non-commercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded
        by investors who expect a return.
    l   An unlimited company with or without a share capital: A hybrid entity, a company where the liability
        of members or shareholders for the debts (if any) of the company are not limited. In this case, the
        doctrine of a veil of incorporation does not apply.
The business activities require resources (which are limited and have multiple uses) primarily in terms of material,
labour, technology etc. The success of a business depends on how efficiently and effectively these resources
are managed. Therefore, there is a need to ensure that the businessman tracks the use of these resources. The
resources are not free, and thus one must be careful to keep an eye on the cost of acquiring them as well. As
the basic purpose of business is to make profit, one must keep an ongoing track of the activities undertaken in
the course of business. Two basic questions would have to be answered:

Introduction to Accounting                                                                                   LESSON 1

   (a)    What is the result of any business operations? i.e. whether it has made profit or loss?
   (b)    What is the position of the resources acquired and used for business purposes? How are these
          resources financed and where do the funds come from?
The answers to these questions can be found through recording all the business activities / transaction / event.
Recording of business activities has to be done in a scientific manner so that they reveal the correct outcome.
Accounting, also known as accountancy, is the measurement, processing, and communication of financial and
non financial information about economic entities such as businesses and corporations. Accounting, which
has been called the “language of business”, measures the results of an organization’s economic activities
and conveys this information to a variety of stakeholders, including investors, creditors, management, and
regulators. Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms “accounting” and “financial
reporting” are often used as synonyms.
  “Accounting is “the art of recording, classifying and summarizing in a significant manner and in terms of
  money, transactions and events which are, in part at least, of a financial character and interpreting the results
  thereof”. - American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (‘AICPA’)

 Attributes of Accounting




   (i)    Accounting is an Art - Accounting is classified as an art, as it helps us in attaining our aim of ascertaining
          the financial results, that is, operating profit and financial position through analysis and interpretation of
          financial data which requires special knowledge, experience and judgment.
   (ii)   It involves recording, classifying and summarizing - Recording means systematically writing down
          the transactions and events in account books soon after their occurrence. Classifying is the process of
          grouping transactions or entries of the same type at one place. This is done by opening accounts in a
          book called ledger. Summarizing involves the preparation of reports and statements from the classified
          data (ledger), understandable and useful to management and other interested parties. This involves

  (iii)   It records transactions in terms of money - All transactions are recorded in terms of common measure,
          i.e., money which increases the understanding of the state of affairs of the business.
  (iv)    It records only those transactions and events which are of financial character - If an event has no
          financial character then it will not be capable of being measured in terms of money; it will not be,
          therefore, recorded.

    (v)   It is the art of interpreting the results of operations - to determine the financial position of the enterprise,

 Objectives of Accounting

      Providing        Accounting provides useful information for decision-making to stakeholders such as
     Information       owners, management, creditors and investors and other stake holders. Various outcomes
     to the Users      of business activities such as costs, prices, sales volume, value under ownership and
     for Rational      return on investment are measured in the accounting process. All these accounting
       Decision        measurements are used by stakeholders in decision making process. Hence, accounting
        making         is identified as the language of a business.

     Systematic        To ensure reliabity and precision for the accounting measurements, it is necessary to
    Recording of       keep a systematic record of all financial transactions of a business enterprise which
    Transactions       is ensured by book-keeping. These financial records are classified, summarized and
                       reposted in the form of accounting measurements to the users of accounting information
                       i.e., stakeholders.
    Ascertainment      Profit/Loss is a core accounting measurement done and measured by preparing a Profit
      the results      and Loss Account for a particular period. Difference between these revenue incomes and
       of above        revenue expenses is known as the result of business transactions identified as profit/loss.
     Transactions      As this measure is used very frequently by stake-holders for rational decision making,
                       it has become the objective of accounting. For example, Income Tax Act requires that
                       every business should have an accounting system that can measure taxable income of
                       the business and also explain nature and source of every item reported in Income Tax
                       Return.
      Ascertain        Financial position is identified by preparing a statement of ownership meaning Assets,
    the Financial      and owing meaning Liabilities of the business as on a certain date. This statement is
     Position of       popularly known as Balance Sheet. This statement may be used by various stakeholders
      Business         for taking financing and investment decisions.
     To Know the       Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account provide useful information to stockholders
      Solvency         regarding potential of the entity to meet their obligations in the short as well as in the
       Position        long run.


 BOOK-KEEPING
As defined by Carter, “Book-Keeping is a science as well as art of correctly recording in books of accounts all
those business transactions that result in transfer of money or money‘s worth”.
Book-keeping is an activity concerned with recording and classifying financial data related to business
operations in order of occurrence.
Book-keeping involves:
     l    Collection of basic financial information
     l    Identification of events and transactions with financial character, i.e., economic transactions
     l    Measurement of economic transactions in terms of money
     l    Recording of financial effects of economic transactions in order of its occurrence
     l    Classifying effects of economic transactions
     l    Preparing organized statement known as Trial Balance

EP-CA&FM                                                                                  Introduction to Accounting

The accounting cycle is a basic, eight-step process for completing a company’s book-keeping tasks. It provides
a clear guide for the recording, analysis, and final reporting of a business’s financial activities.

The steps or phases of accounting cycle can be developed as under:

 Basic Accounting Terms
In order to understand the Accounting clearly, one must grasp the following common expressions used in
business accounting. The aim here is to enable the student to understand these often used concepts before we
embark on accounting procedures and rules.

    l   Transaction: It means an event or a business activity which involves exchange of money or money‘s
        worth between parties. The event can be measured in terms of money and changes the financial
        position of a entity e.g., purchase of goods would involve receiving material and making payment or
        creating an obligation to pay to the supplier at a future date. Transaction could be a cash transaction
        or credit transaction. When the parties settle the transaction immediately by making payment in cash
        or by cheque, it is called a cash transaction. On the other hand, in credit transactions, the payment is
        settled at a future date as per agreement between the parties.

    l   Event: An event may be described as any incidence that occurs as a result of something. In an
        accounting sense, an event can be understood as the final outcome of a business activity that can
        affect the account balances of the company if it is financial in nature. Whenever there is an increase
        or decrease in the company’s assets or liabilities, an accounting event takes place. Therefore, it can
        change the fundamental accounting equation and can be expressed monetarily.

    l   Goods/Services: These are tangible article or commodities in which a business deals. These articles
        or commodities are either bought and sold or produced and sold. At times, what may be classified
        as goods to one business firm may not be goods to the other firm, e.g., for a machine manufacturing
        company, the machines are goods as they are frequently made and sold. But for the buying firm, it is
        not goods as the intention is to use it as a long-term resource and not sell it. The services are intangible
        in nature and are rendered with or without the object of earning profits.

    l   Capital Expenditure: This represents expenditure incurred for the purpose of acquiring a fixed asset
        which is intended to be used over long term for earning profits there from, e.g., amount paid to buy a
        computer for office use is a capital expenditure. At times expenditure may be incurred for enhancing the
        production capacity of the machine. This will also be a capital expenditure. Capital expenditure forms
        a part of the Balance Sheet.

    l   Revenue Expenditure: This represents expenditure incurred to earn revenue of the current period.
        The benefits of revenue expenses get exhausted in the year of the incurrence. For example repairs,
        insurance, salary and wages to employees, travel, etc. The revenue expenditure results in the reduction
        in profit or surplus. It becomes part of the Income statement.

    l   Profit and Loss Account or Income Statement: This account shows the revenue earned by the
        business and the expenses incurred by it to earn that revenue. This is prepared usually for a particular
        accounting period, which could be a month, quarter, half a year or a year. The net result of the Profit
        and Loss Account shows profit earned or loss suffered by the business entity.

    l   Profit: The excess of revenue over expenses is called profit.

    l   Loss: The excess of expense over income is called loss.

Introduction to Accounting                                                                                  LESSON 1

    l   Trade Discount: It is the discount usually allowed by the wholesaler to the retailer computed on the
        list price or invoice price. For example, the list price of a TV set could be Rs. 15,000. The wholesaler
        may allow 20% discount thereof to the retailer. This means the retailer will get it for Rs.12,000 and is
        expected to sell it finally to a customer at the list price. Thus, the trade discount enables the retailer
        to make profit by selling at the list price. Trade discount is not recorded in the books of accounts. The
        transactions are recorded at net values only. In the above example, the transaction will be recorded at
        Rs. 12,000 only.

    l   Cash Discount: It is allowed to encourage prompt payment by the debtor. It has to be recorded in the
        books of accounts. It is calculated after deducting the trade discount, like if list price is Rs. 15,000 on
        which a trade discount of 20% and cash discount of 2% apply, the first trade discount of Rs.3,000 (20%
        of Rs. 15,000) will be deducted and the cash discount of 2% will be calculated on Rs.12,000 (Rs.15,000 –
        Rs.3,000). Hence, the cash discount will be Rs.240 (2% of Rs. 12,000) and net payment will be Rs. 11,760
        (Rs. 12,000 - Rs. 240)

    l   Balance Sheet: It is the statement of the financial position of the business entity on a particular date.
        It lists all assets, liabilities and capital. It is important to note that this statement exhibits the state of
        affairs of the business as on a particular date only. It describes what the business owns and what it
        owes to outsiders (this denotes liabilities), and to the owners (this denotes capital). It is prepared after
        incorporating the resulting Profit/Loss or Income Statement.

    l   Asset: Asset is a resource owned by a business with the purpose of using it for generating future profits.
        Assets can be tangible and intangible.

    l   Tangible Assets are the capital assets which have some physical existence. These can, therefore,
        be seen, touched and felt, e.g., plant and machinery, furniture and fittings, land and buildings, books,
        computers and vehicles.

    l   Intangible Assets: The capital assets which have no physical existence and whose value is limited by
        the rights and anticipated benefits that possession confers upon the owner are known as intangible
        assets. These cannot be seen or felt although these help to generate revenue in future, e.g., goodwill,
        patents, trade-marks, copyrights, brand equity, designs and intellectual property, etc.

    l   Classification of Assets: Assets can also be classified as Current Assets and Non-Current Assets.




    l   Current Assets – An asset can be classified as Current if it satisfies any of the following:
           i.   It is expected to be realized in, or is intended for sale or consumption in the company‘s normal
                Operating cycle;
          ii.   It is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;



                                                                                                                     7
EP-CA&FM                                                                                    Introduction to Accounting

         iii.   It is due to be realized within 12 months after the Reporting Date; or

         iv.    It is Cash or Cash Equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a
                liability for at least 12 months after the Reporting Date.

    l   Non-Current Assets – Other than Current Assets, all other assets are classified as Non-Current Assets,
        e.g., Machinery held for Long-term, etc.

    l   Current Investments: Current investments are investments that are by their nature readily realizable
        and are intended to be held for not more than one year from the date on which such investment is
        made. 11-months Commercial Paper is an example of current investment.

    l   Non-Current Investments: Non-Current Investments are investments which are held beyond the current
        period for sale or disposal, like a Fixed Deposit for 5 years.

    l   Debtor: The sum total or aggregate of the amounts which the customer owes to the business for the
        purchase of goods on credit or services rendered or in respect of other contractual obligations, is
        known as Sundry Debtors or Trade Debtors, or Trade Payable, or Book-Debts or Debtors. These debtors
        may again be classified as under:

        (a)     Good Debts: The debts which are sure to be realized are called good debts.

        (b)     Doubtful Debts: The debts which may or may not be realized are called doubtful debts.

        (c)     Bad Debts: The debts which cannot be realized at all are called bad debts.

    l   Fictitious Assets: Fictitious assets are not assets at all since they are not represented by any tangible
        possession. They appear on the asset side simply because of a debit balance in a particular account
        not yet written off, e.g., provision for discount to creditors, discount on issue of shares, etc.

    l   Wasting Assets: Such assets as mines, quarries, etc., that become exhausted or reduce in value by
        their workings are called wasting assets.

    l   Liability: It is an obligation of financial nature to be settled at a future date. It represents amount of
        money that the business owes to the other parties. For instance, when goods are bought on credit, the
        firm will create an obligation to pay to the supplier, the price of goods on an agreed future date, or when
        a loan is taken from bank, an obligation to pay the interest and principal amount is created. Depending
        upon the period of holding, these obligations could be further classified into long term or Non-current
        liabilities, and short term or current liabilities.

    l   Current Liabilities – A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following:

          i.    It is expected to be settled in the company‘s normal Operating Cycle;

         ii.    It is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;

         iii.   It is due to be settled within 12 months after the Reporting Date; or

         iv.    The company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least
                12 months after the reporting date.

    l   Non-Current Liabilities – Other than Current Liabilities, all other liabilities shall be classified as Non-
        Current Liabilities. For example loan taken for 5 years, Debentures issued etc.

    l   Contingent Liability: It represents a potential obligation that could be created depending on the
        outcome of an event. For example, if a supplier of a business files a legal suit, it will not be treated as a

8
Introduction to Accounting                                                                                LESSON 1

        liability because no obligation is created immediately. If the verdict of the case is given in favour of the
        supplier then only the obligation is created. Till that time it is treated as a contingent liability. Please
        note that contingent liability is not recorded in books of account, but disclosed through a note in the
        financial statements.

    l   Capital: Capital is the amount invested in a business by its owners. It may be in the form of cash, goods,
        or any other asset which the proprietor or partners of business invest in the business.

    l   Drawings: It represents the amount of cash, goods or any other assets which the owner withdraws from
        business for his or her personal use, e.g., the life insurance premium of the proprietor or a partner of
        the firm is paid from the business, it is called drawings. Drawings will result in a reduction in the owners‘
        capital. The concept of drawing is not applicable to the corporate bodies like limited companies.

    l   Net worth: It represents the excess of total assets over total liabilities of a business. Technically, this
        amount is made available to be distributed to the owners in the event of closure of the business after
        payment of all liabilities.

    l   Creditor: A creditor is a person to whom the business owes money or money‘s worth. For example,
        money payable to the supplier of goods or provider of service. Creditors are generally classified as
        Current Liabilities.

 SINGLE ENTRY SYSTEM
Single-entry bookkeeping, also known as, single-entry accounting, is a method of bookkeeping that relies
on a one-sided accounting entry to maintain financial information. In case of double entry system of book-
keeping both the aspects of every transaction are recorded. In this system, the first entry is made to the debit
of an account, and the second entry to the credit of second account. However, in case of single entry system,
the business houses for their convenience and more practical approach ignore the strict rules of double entry
system. The users of this system maintain only the essential records. In other words, it is a system which may
not keep some books of subsidiary records, and some ledger accounts too which otherwise are kept in case of
double entry system.

According to a Dictionary of Accountancy by Kohler, “A system of book-keeping in which as a rule only
records of cash and of personal accounts are maintained, it is always incomplete double entry varying with
the circumstances.” Thus, under the so-called single entry system both the aspects of business transactions
and events are not recorded. Under the single entry system usually a cash book and personal accounts are
maintained.

 DOUBLE ENTRY SYSTEM
Double-entry bookkeeping, also known as double-entry accounting, is a method of bookkeeping that relies on a
two-sided accounting entry to maintain financial information. Every entry to an account requires a corresponding
and opposite entry to a different account. The double-entry system has two equal and corresponding sides
known as debit and credit.

It was in 1494 that Luca Pacioli, the Italian mathematician, first published his comprehensive treatise on the
principles of Double Entry System. The use of principles of double entry system made it possible to record
not only cash but also all sorts of mercantile transactions. It had created a profound impact on auditing too,
because it enhanced the duties of an auditor to a considerable extent.

EP-CA&FM                                                                                      Introduction to Accounting

 Features of Double Entry System
     (a)    Every transaction has two-fold aspects, i.e., one party giving the benefit and the other receiving the
            benefit.
     (b)    Every transaction is divided into two aspects, debit and credit. One account is to be debited and the
            other account is to be credited.
     (c)    Every debit must have its corresponding and equal credit.

 Advantages of Double Entry System
     (a)    Since personal and impersonal accounts are maintained under the double entry system, both the
            effects of the transactions are recorded.
     (b)    It ensures arithmetical accuracy of the books of accounts, for every debit, there is a corresponding and
            equal credit. This is ascertained by preparing a trial balance periodically, or at the end of the financial
            year.
     (c)    It prevents and minimizes error. Moreover frauds can be detected early.
     (d)    Errors can be checked and rectified easily.
     (e)    The balances of receivables and payables are determined easily, since the personal accounts are
            maintained.
     (f)    The businessman can compare the financial position of the current year with that of the past years.
     (g)    The businessman can justify the standing of his business in comparison with the previous year purchase,
            sales, and stocks, incomes and expenses with that of the current year figures.
     (h)    Helps in decision-making.
     (i)    The net operating results can be calculated by preparing the Trading and Profit and Loss A/c for the
            year ended and the financial position can be ascertained by the preparation of the Balance Sheet.
     ( j)   It helps the Government to decide sickness of business units and extend help accordingly.
     (k)    The other stakeholders, like suppliers and banks can take a proper decision regarding grant of credit
            or loans.

 Limitations of Double Entry System
     (a)    The system does not disclose all the errors committed in the books of accounts.
     (b)    The Trial Balance prepared under this system does not disclose certain types of errors i.e. compensating
            error.
     (c)    It is costly as it involves maintenance of numbers of books of accounts.

 ACCOUNTING CONCEPT
Accounting concepts are the generally accepted rules and assumptions that assist accountants in preparing
financial statements. In layman’s terms, they are the fundamental building blocks of the transactions of the
business. The following are the some Accounting Concepts that’s need to be kept in mind while recording the
transaction in books of accounts.

Introduction to Accounting                                                                                LESSON 1

    1.   Accruals Concept: An accrual is a journal entry that is used to recognize revenues and expenses
         that have been earned or consumed, respectively, and for which the related cash amounts have not
         yet been received or paid out. Accruals are needed to ensure that all revenues and expenses are
         recognized within the correct reporting period, irrespective of the timing of the related cash flows.
   2.    Conservatism Concept: Revenue is only recognized when there is a reasonable certainty that it will be
         realized, whereas expenses are recognized sooner, when there is a reasonable possibility that they will
         be incurred. This concept tends to result in more conservative financial statements.
   3.    Consistency Concept: Once a business chooses to use a specific accounting method, it should continue
         using it on a go-forward basis. By doing so, financial statements prepared in multiple periods can be
         reliably compared.
    4.   Economic Entity Concept: The transactions of a business are to be kept separate from those of its
         owners. By doing so, there is no intermingling of personal and business transactions in a company’s
         financial statements.
   5.    Going Concern Concept: Financial statements are prepared on the assumption that the business will
         remain in operation in future periods. Under this assumption, revenue and expense recognition may be
         deferred to a future period, when the company is still operating. Otherwise, all expense recognition in
         particular would be accelerated into the current period.
   6.    Matching Concept: The expenses related to revenue should be recognized in the same period in
         which the revenue was recognized. By doing this, there is no deferral of expense recognition into later
         reporting periods, so that someone viewing a company’s financial statements can be assured that all
         aspects of a transaction have been recorded at the same time.
    7.   Materiality Concept: Materiality is an accounting principle which states that all items that are
         reasonably likely to impact investors’ decision-making must be recorded or reported in detail in a
         business’s financial statements using GAAP standards. Materiality is a concept that defines why and
         how certain issues are important for a company or a business sector. A material issue can have a major
         impact on the financial, economic, reputational, and legal aspects of a company, as well as on the
         system of internal and external stakeholders of that company. Items or events which have significant
         effect in decision based on Financial Statement must be clearly disclosed. Both nature and volume of
         a transaction is capable to make it material.

 TYPES OF ACCOUNTS
An account is defined as a summarized record of transactions related to a person or a thing, e.g., when the
business deals with customers and suppliers, the customer and supplier will each be a separate account.
The account is also related to things – both tangible and intangible, like, land, building, equipment, brand value
and trademarks are some of the things. When a business transaction happens, one has to identify the account
that will be affected by it and then apply the rules to decide its accounting treatment.
Typically, an account is expressed as a statement in the form of English letter ‘T‘. It has two sides. The left hand
side is called as the Debit side, and the right hand side is called as the Credit side. The debit is denoted as
‘Dr‘and the credit as ‘Cr‘. The convention is to write the Dr. and Cr. labels on both sides as shown below.


                              Debit side (Dr.)                       Credit side (Cr.)




                                                                                                                 11

     1.   Personal Account: As the name suggests these are accounts related to persons.
          (a)   These persons could be natural persons, like Suresh’s A/c, Anil’s A/c and Rani’s A/c.
          (b)   The persons could also be artificial persons like companies, bodies corporate or association of
                persons or partnerships. Accordingly, we could have Videocon Industries A/c, Infosys Technologies
                A/c, Charitable Trust A/c, Ali and Sons Trading A/c and ABC Bank A/c.
          (c)   There could be representative personal accounts as well. Although the individual identity
                of persons related to these is known, the convention is to reflect them as collective accounts,
                e.g., when salary is payable to employees, we know how much is payable to each of them, but
                collectively the account is called as Salary Payable A/c.
     2.   Real Accounts: These are accounts related to assets or properties or possessions Depending on their
          physical existence or otherwise, they are further classified as follows:
          (a)   Tangible Real Account – Assets that have physical existence and can be seen and touched, under
                this as Machinery A/c, Stock A/c, Cash A/c, Vehicle A/c, and the like.
          (b)   Intangible Real Account – These represent possession of properties that have no physical
                existence but can be measured in terms of money and have value attached to them like Goodwill
                A/c, Trade Mark A/c, Patents & Copy Rights A/c and Intellectual Property Rights A/c.
     3.   Nominal Account: These accounts are related to expenses or losses and incomes or gains e.g. Salary
          and Wages A/c, Rent and Rates A/c, Travelling Expenses A/c, Commission received A/c and Loss by fire
          A/c.

 Golden Rules of Accounting
When one identifies the account that is getting affected by a transaction and type of that account, the next step
is to apply the rules to decide whether the accounting treatment is to be debited or credited from that account.
The Golden Rules will guide whether the account is to be debited or credited. These rules are shown below:

 JOURNAL
A journal is often referred to the Book of Prime Entry or Book of Original Entry. In this book transactions are
recorded in their chronological order. The process of recording transaction in a journal is called ‘Journalization‘.
The entry made in this book is called ‘journal entry‘.

 Advantages of Journal
The following are the advantages of a journal:
   (a)   Chronological Record: It records transactions as and when it happens. So it is possible to get detailed
         day-to- day information.
   (b)   Minimizing the possibility of errors: The nature of transaction and its effect on the financial position of
         the business is determined by recording and analyzing into both debit and credit aspects.
   (c)   Narration: It means explanation of the recorded transactions.
   (d)   Helps to finalize the accounts: Journal is the basis of ledger posting and the ultimate Trial Balance.
		 The Trial Balance helps to prepare the final accounts.

     (d)    Ledger Folio (L.F.): This column contains the folio (i.e., page no.) of the ledger, where the transaction is
            posted.
     (e)    Dr. Amount and Cr. Amount: This column shows the financial value of each transaction. The amount is
            recorded in both the columns, since for every debit there is a corresponding and equal credit.

 Sub-division of Journals
Journal is divided into two types -(i) General Journal and (ii) Special Journal.




     (i)    General Journal
            (a)   This book contains chronological record of transactions.
            (b)   This book records those transactions which occur so infrequently that they do not warrant the
                  setting up of special journals.
		 Examples of such entries: (i) opening entries (ii) closing entries (iii) rectification of errors. The form of this
   general journal, is as under:
                                                        JOURNAL

              Date       Particulars                             L.F.          Dr. Amount             Cr. Amount




		 Recording of transactions in this book is called journalizing and the record of transactions is known as
   journal entry.
     (ii)   Special Journal
		 It is sub-divided into Cash Book, Purchase Day Book, Sales Day Book, Returns Inward Book, Returns
   Outward Book, Bills Receivable Book and Bills Payable Book. These books are called subsidiary books.

 Subsidiary Books
Subsidiary Books refer to books meant for specific transactions of similar nature. These books are also known
as special journals or day books. To overcome shortcoming of the use of the journal only as a book of original
entry, the journal is sub-divided into specific journals or subsidiary books.

  expense accruals, rectification entries, adjusting
  entries, opening entries and closing entries

 Cash Book
A Cash Book is a special journal which is used for recording all cash receipts and cash payments. Cash Book is
a book of original entry since transactions are recorded for the first time from the source documents. The Cash
Book is larger in the sense that it is designed in the form of a Cash Account and records cash receipts on the
debit side and cash payments on the credit side. Thus, the Cash Book is both a journal and a ledger.

     (a)   Single Column Cash Book- Single Column Cash book has one amount column on each side. All cash
           receipts are recorded on the debit side and all cash payments on the payment side; this book is nothing
           but a Cash Account and there is no need to open separate cash account in the ledger.

           recorded on the credit side. In fact, a triple-column cash book serves the purpose of both Cash Account
           and Bank Account. Thus, there is no need to create these two accounts in the ledger.

     Is the Cash Book a Journal or a Ledger?
     Cash Book is a book of original entry since transactions are recorded for the first time from the source
     documents. It is a ledger in the sense that it is designed in the form of a Cash Account and records cash
     receipts on the debit side and cash payments on the credit side. Thus, the cash book is both a journal and
     a ledger.

 Purchase Day Book
The purchase day book records the transactions related to credit purchase of goods only. Any cash purchase or
purchase of things other than goods is not recorded in the purchase day book. Periodically, the totals of purchase
day book are posted to purchase account in the ledger. A specimen of purchase day book is given below:

The format for Purchase Return Book is exactly the same; hence separate illustration is not given.

 Sales Day Book
The sales day book records transactions of credit sale of goods to customers. Sale of other things, even on
credit, will not be entered in the sales day book, but is entered in Journal. If goods are sold for cash, it is entered
in the cash book. Total of sales day book is periodically posted to the sales account in the ledger. A specimen
of a sales day book is given below.

          customer returns goods to suppliers, he issues a Debit Note for the value of the goods returned by him.
          Similarly, the supplier who receives those goods issues a Credit Note.

 Journal Proper
Credit transactions that cannot be entered in any other subsidiary book are entered in journal proper. It will
cover purchase or sale of assets, expense accruals, rectification entries, adjusting entries, opening entries and
closing entries. The format of journal proper is same as the Journal.

 LEDGER ACCOUNTS
The book which contains accounts is known as the ledger. Since finding information pertaining to the financial
position of a business emerges only from the accounts, the ledger is also called the Principal Book. As a result,
all the necessary information relating to any account is available from the ledger. This is the most important
book of the business and hence is rightly called the “King of All Books”.

 Ledger Posting
As and when the transaction takes place, it is recorded in the journal in the form of journal entry. This entry
is posted again in the respective ledger accounts under double entry principle from the journal. This is called
ledger posting.
The rules for writing up accounts of various types are as follows:
Assets: Increases on the debit side and decreases on the credit side.
Liabilities: Increases on the credit side and decreases on the debit side.
Capitals: Increases on the credit side and decreases on the debit side.
Expenses: Increases on the debit side and decreases on the credit side.
Incomes or Gain: Increases on the credit side and decreases on the debit side.

 Posting to Ledger Accounts from Subsidiary Books
In the above section, we have explained how posting is done to ledger accounts directly on the basis of journal
entries. In practice, however, we know that use of subsidiary books is in vogue. Let us see how the posting to
ledger accounts is done based on these records. For each of the subsidiary books, there is a ledger account,
e.g., for purchase book, there is Purchase Account, for sales book there is Sales A/c, for cash book there is
Cash A/c as well as Bank A/c and so on. In case of balance various ledger accounts, some accounts show debit
balance, while the others show credit balance. Is there any relationship between the type of account (whether
it is the account of asset, liability, capital, owner‘s equity, income or gain, expenses or losses) and the kind of
balance (debit or credit).
The answer is generally ‘Yes‘. You may test to find the following are typical relationships.

                      Type of Account                              Type of balance

                      All asset accounts                           Debit balance

                      All liability accounts                       Credit balance

                      Capital & Owner‘s equity account             Credit balance

                      Expenses or loss accounts                    Debit balance

                      Income or gain accounts                      Credit balance


  Let us test these possibilities for confirmation. How does one go about testing this? Consider ‘Cash A/c‘.
  Whenever business receives cash we debit it, and whenever it pays we credit it. Is it possible to see a
  situation where credits to cash are more than debits? In other words could we have negative cash in hand?
  No. Cash account will therefore always show a debit balance. So is true for all real asset accounts.
  After solving problems, if the contrary is observed, there is every chance that an error has been made
  while passing the accounting entries.


 Closing Balance and Opening Balance
The debit or credit balance of an account that we get at the end of the accounting period is known as closing
balance of that account.
The “balance of the nominal accounts” is closed by transferring to trading account, and the profit and loss
account which shows the net operating results – net profit or net loss.



                                                                                                                  19

The “balance of the personal accounts and real accounts” representing assets, liabilities, owner‘s equity are
reflected in the Balance Sheet, which shows the financial position of a business on a particular date. These
balances are transported as opening balance in the succeeding accounting period.
Some terms used:
Casting — totaling
Balancing — to find the difference between debit side total and credit side total of an account.
C/d -Carried down         B/d -Brought down
C/o - Carried over        B/o - Brought over
C/f - Carried forward     B/f - Brought forward

 Sub-divisions of Ledger
Practically, the Ledger may be divided into two groups - Personal Ledger and Impersonal Ledger.
They are again sub-divided as:




Personal Ledger: The ledger where the details of all transactions about persons who are related to the
accounting unit are recorded is called Personal Ledger.
Again, Personal Ledger may be divided into two groups: viz. (a) Debtors‘ Ledger, and (b) Creditors‘ Ledger.
     i)    Debtors’ Ledger: The ledger where the details of transactions about the persons to whom goods are
           sold, cash is received, etc., are recorded is called Debtors‘ Ledger.
     ii)   Creditors’ Ledger: The ledger where the details of transactions about the persons from whom goods
           are purchased on credit, cash paid to them, etc., are recorded, is called Creditors‘ Ledger.
Impersonal Ledger: The ledger where details of all transactions about assets, income & expenses, etc., are
recorded is called Impersonal Ledger.
Impersonal Ledger may, again be divided into two group, viz., (a) Cash Book; and (b) General Ledger.
     i)    Cash Book: The book wherein all cash & bank transactions are recorded is called Cash Book.
     ii)   General Ledger: The ledger where all transactions relating to real accounts, nominal accounts are
           recorded is called General Ledger.

General Ledger may again be divided into two groups, viz., Nominal Ledger & Private Ledger.
    a)     Nominal Ledger: The ledger where all transactions relating to income and expenses are recorded is
           called Nominal Ledger.
    b)     Private Ledger: The Ledger where all transactions relating to assets and liabilities are recorded is
           called Private Ledger.

 TRIAL BALANCE
Trial Balance may be defined as a statement or a list of all ledger account balances taken from various ledger
books on a particular date to check the arithmetical accuracy.
Trial Balance is defined as “a list or abstract of the balances or of total debits and total credits of the accounts
in a ledger, the purpose being to determine the equality of posted debits and credits and to establish a basic
summary for financial statements”. According to Rolland, “The final list of balances, totaled and combined, is
called Trial Balance”. – By Eric. L. Kohler
As this is merely a listing of balances, it will always be on a particular date. Further, it must be understood
that Trial Balance does not form part of Books of Account, but it is a report prepared by extracting balances of
accounts maintained in the books of accounts.
When this list with tallied debit and credit balances is drawn up, the arithmetical accuracy of basic entries,
ledger posting and balancing is ensured. However, it does not guarantee that the entries are correct in all
respect.
It can be seen that the respective total of debit and credit balances is exactly matching. This is the result of
double entry book-keeping wherein every debit has equal corresponding credit.

 Features of a Trial Balance
    (i)    It is a list of debit and credit balances which are extracted from various ledger accounts.
   (ii)    It is a statement of debit and credit balances.
   (iii)   The purpose is to establish arithmetical accuracy of the transactions recorded in the Books of Accounts.
  (iv)     It is not an account. It is only a statement of account.
   (v)     It is not a part of the financial statements.
  (vi)     It is usually prepared at the end of the accounting year but it can also be prepared anytime as and
           when required like weekly, monthly, quarterly or half-yearly.
  (vii)    It is a link between the Books of Accounts, Profit and Loss Account and Balance sheet.

 Preparation of Trial Balance
    (i)    The ledger accounts are balanced at first. They will have either “debit-balance” or “credit balance” or
           “nil- balance”.
   (ii)    The accounts containing debit-balance are written on the debit column, and those with credit-balance
           are written on the credit column.
   (iii)   The sum total of both the balances must be equal for “Every debit has its corresponding and equal
           credit”.

 Purpose of a Trial Balance
It serves the following purposes:
      (i)    To check the arithmetical accuracy of the recorded transactions.
     (ii)    To ascertain the balance of any ledger account.
     (iii)   To serve as an evidence of the fact that the double entry has been completed in respect of every
             transaction.
     (iv)    To facilitate the preparation of final accounts promptly.

     Is Trial Balance Indispensable?
     It is a mere statement prepared by the accountants for their convenience, and if it agrees, it is assumed
     that at least arithmetical accuracy has been done, although there may be an errors.
     Trial Balance is not a process of accounting, but its preparation helps us to finalize the accounts. Since it
     is prepared on a particular date, as at ........ / as on ......... is stated.

     No.




 Method of Preparation
     (a)     Total Method or Gross Trial Balance.

     (b)     Balance Method or Net Trial Balance.

     (c)     Compound Method.

These are explained as hereunder:

     (a)     Total Method or Gross Trial Balance : Under this method, two sides of the accounts are totalled. The
             total of the debit side is called the “debit total”, and the total of the credit side is called the “credit total”.
             Debit totals are entered on the debit side of the trial balance while the credit total is entered on the
             credit side of the trial balance.

		 If a particular account has total in one side, it will be entered either in the debit column or the credit
   column as the case may be.

		Advantages:

             (a)   It facilitates arithmetical accuracy of the accounts.

             (b)   Extraction of ledger balances is not required at the time of preparation of trial balance.

		Disadvantages: Preparation of final accounts is not possible.

     (b)     Balance Method or Net Trial Balance: Under this method, all the ledger accounts are balanced. The
             balances may be either “debit-balance” or “credit balance”.

		Advantages:
         (a)    It helps in the easy preparation of final accounts.
         (b)    It saves time and labour in preparing a trial balance.
		Disadvantages: Errors may remain undisclosed irrespective of the agreement of trial balance.
   (c)   Compound Method: Under this method, totals of both the sides of the accounts are written in separate
         columns. Along with this, the balances are also written in the separate columns. Debit balances are
         written in the debit column and credit balances are written in the credit column of the trial balance.
		Advantages: It offers the advantage of both the methods.
		Disadvantages: It is a lengthy process and more time is consumed in the preparation of a trial balance.

  Summary of Rules
  Debit Balance - All Assets, Drawings, Debtors, Expenses and Losses.
  Credit Balance - All Liabilities, Capital, Creditors, Gains and Incomes.


 FINAL ACCOUNTS
The primary function of accounting includes computing the net result of operations of the business for the
current period. To meet out this purpose, Trading Accounts, Income statement and Balance sheet are prepared.
These documents are popularly called as Final Accounts. It is the last phase of Accounting Process.
The components of final accounts depend upon the type of entity. In case of non-manufacturing entities, the
business operations include purchase and sale of goods. That is why Trading Account is prepared to calculate
Gross Profit. But a manufacturing entity is interested in computation of total cost of manufacturing the finished
products. For this purpose, separate account is prepared as Manufacturing Account. The following table shows
the components of final accounts for manufacturing and non-manufacturing firms:

               Manufacturing firm                                     Non-Manufacturing Firm

   1      Manufacturing A/c                         1      Trading A/c

   2      Trading A/c                               2      Profit and Loss A/c

   3      Profit and Loss A/c                       3      Balance Sheet

   4      Balance Sheet

The process of final accounts starts after preparation of trial balance. It is mainly divided into following two
parts:
    1.   Income Statement: It is prepared to find out the net result of the operations. It is sub-divided into two
         parts:
          a)    Trading Account
          b)    Profit and Loss Account
   2.    Position Statement: It includes Balance Sheet showing the status of assets and liabilities as at a
         particular point of time.

 Trading Account
A trading account shows the results of the buying and selling of goods. This sheet is prepared to demonstrate the
difference between the selling price and the cost price. It show the trading results of the business, example- gross
profit earned or gross loss sustained by the business. It records the direct expenses of a business firm.
“The Trading Account shows the result of buying and selling goods. In preparing this account, the general
establishment charges are ignored and only the transactions in goods are included.” - J. R. Batlibboi

 Profit and Loss Account
This account is prepared to ascertain the net profit/loss and expenses of a business during an accounting year.
It records the indirect expenses of a business firm, like rent, salaries, and advertising expenses. Profit and loss
a/c includes expenses and losses as well as income and gains, which have occurred in business other than the
production of goods and services.

 Balance Sheet
The balance statement demonstrates the financial position of a business on a specific date. The financial
position of a business is found by tabulating its assets and liabilities on a particular date. The excess of assets
over liabilities represents the capital sunk into the business and reflects the financial soundness of a company.
Now it is known as the statement of financial position of the company.
[Note: The detail discussion with respect to preparation and presentation of Trading and Profit & Loss A/c as well
as Balance Sheet is discussed in lesson No. 2.]



                                               LESSON ROUND-UP

     l Accounting information should be relevant, reliable, comparable, understandable, timely, neutral,
        verifiable and complete.
     l Accounting can be based on cash or accrual system. In cash system, accounting entries are passed
        only when cash is received or paid, while in accrual system transactions are recorded on the basis of
        amounts having become due for payment or receipt.
     l Book-keeping is different from accounting. Book-keeping is concerned with the permanent recording
        or maintaining of all transactions in a systematic manner to show their financial effects on the business.
     l Accounting is concerned with the summarizing of the recorded transactions.

     l Accounting principles are guidelines to establish standards for sound accounting practices and
        procedures in reporting the financial status of a business. These principles can be accounting concepts
        and accounting conventions.
     l Accounting concepts are defined as basic assumptions on the basis of which financial statements of
        a business entity are prepared. While ‘convention’ denotes custom or tradition or practice based on
        general agreement between the accounting bodies which guide the accountant while preparing the
        financial statements.
     l Some of the important accounting concepts are: going concern concept, accrual concept, accounting
        period concept, materiality concept etc.

    l Two classes of accounts are personal accounts and impersonal accounts. Impersonal accounts can
       be further classified into real and nominal accounts.
    l Accounting cycle includes identifying, recording, classifying and summarizing of the transactions.

    l Every transaction is recorded in the journal before being posted into the ledger. It is the book of
       account in which transactions are recorded in a chronological order.
    l Recording in the journal is done following the rules of debit and credit which is called Golden Rules of
       Accounting.
    l Posting is the process of recording transactions in the ledger based on the entries in the journal.

    l The main function of a ledger is to classify or sort out all the items appearing in the journal or other
       subsidiary books under their appropriate accounts so that at the end of the accounting period summary
       of each account is easily available.
    l Balancing of ledger accounts involves equalization of both sides of the account by putting the
       difference on the side where the amount is short.
    l Various subsidiary books are: purchases book; sales book; purchases returns book; sales returns
       book; bills receivable book; bills payable book and cash book.
    l General journal or journal proper is maintained for recording those transactions for which there are
       no other appointed subsidiary book.
    l Trial balance is prepared after posting and balancing the entries in ledger to verify the arithmetical
       accuracy of entries made in the ledger.
    l Final Accounts: The primary function of accounting includes computing the net result of operations of
       the business for the current period. To meet out this purpose, Trading Accounts, Income statement and
       Balance sheet are prepared. These documents are popularly called as Final Accounts.

 Central Government to Prescribe Accounting Standards
 The Central Government may prescribe the standards of accounting or any addendum thereto, as recommended
 by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, constituted under section 3 of the Chartered Accountants
 Act, 1949, in consultation with and after examination of the recommendations made by the National Financial
 Reporting Authority.

    l   The items contained in such financial statements shall be in accordance with the accounting standards.
    l   This sub-section shall not apply to any insurance or banking company or any company engaged in
        the generation or supply of electricity, or to any other class of company for which a form of financial
        statement has been specified in or under the Act governing such class of company. However, the
        financial statements shall not be treated as not disclosing a true and fair view of the state of affairs of
        the company, merely by reason of the fact that they do not disclose –
         (a)   in the case of an insurance company, any matters which are not required to be disclosed by
               the Insurance Act, 1938, or the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999;
         (b)   in the case of a banking company, any matters which are not required to be disclosed by the
               Banking Regulation Act, 1949;
         (c)   in the case of a company engaged in the generation or supply of electricity, any matters which
               are not required to be disclosed by the Electricity Act, 2003;

               are not required to be disclosed by that law.

        all members financial statements for the financial year.
    l   Where a company has one or more subsidiaries, it shall, in addition to financial statements provided
        above, prepares a consolidated financial statement of the company and of all the subsidiaries in the
        same form and manner as that of its own which shall also be laid before the annual general meeting of
        the company along with the laying of its financial statement under Section 129(2) of the Companies Act,
        2013.

        salient features of the financial statement of its subsidiary or subsidiaries. According to the rules, the
        statement shall contain the salient features of the financial statement of a company’s subsidiary or
        subsidiaries, associate company and joint venture.
    l   The consolidation of financial statements of the company shall be made in accordance with the
        Accounting Standards, subject however, to the requirement that if under such Accounting Standards
        (AS), consolidation is not required for the reason that the company has its immediate parent outside
        India, then such companies will also be required to prepare Consolidated Financial Statements in the
        manner and format as specified under Schedule III to the Act.
    l   The provisions of this Act are applicable to the preparation, adoption and audit of the financial statements
        of a holding company shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to the consolidated financial statements.

     l   The Central Government may, on its own or on an application by a class or classes of companies, by
         notification, exempt any class or classes of companies from complying with any of the requirements
         of this section or the rules made thereunder, if it is considered necessary to grant such exemption in
         the public interest and any such exemption may be granted either unconditionally or subject to such
         conditions as may be specified in the notification.

         officers mentioned above, all the directors shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may
         extend to one year or with fine which shall not be less than fifty thousand rupees but which may extend
         to rupees five lakh or with both.

          Explanation –Any reference to the financial statement shall include any notes annexed to or forming
          part of such financial statement, giving information required to be given and allowed to be given in
          the form of such notes under this Act.

 SCHEDULE III OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013
According to Section 129 of the Companies Act, 2013, all the companies registered under this Act will have
to present its financial statements in Schedule III of the Companies Act. The Schedule III of the Companies Act,
2013 has been formulated to keep pace with the changes in the economic philosophy leading to privatization
and globalization and consequent desired changes/reforms in the corporate financial reporting practices. It
deals with the Form of Balance Sheet, Statement of Profit and Loss, and disclosures to be made therein, and
it applies uniformly to all the companies registered under the Companies Act, 2013, for the preparation of
financial statements of an accounting year. It has several new features like:
     l   A vertical format for presentation of Balance Sheet with classification of Balance Sheet items into
         current and non-current categories.
     l   A vertical format of Statement of Profit and Loss with classification of expenses based on nature.
     l   Elimination of the concept of “Schedules” and such information is now to be furnished in terms of “Notes
         to Accounts”.
     l   It does not contain any specific disclosure for items included in Schedule VI under the head,
         “Miscellaneous Expenditure”. As per Accounting Standard -16 borrowing cost and discount or premium
         relating to borrowing could be amortized over the loan period. Further, share issue expenses, discount
         on shares, discount/ premium on borrowing, etc. are excluded from AS-26. These items be amortized
         over the period of benefit, i.e., normally 3-5 years. The draft guidance note issued by ICAI suggests that
         unamortized portion of such expenses be shown under the head “Other Current/Non-current Assets”
         depending on whether the amount will be amortized in the next 12 months or thereafter.
     l   Debit Balance of Statement of Profit & Loss A/c will be disclosed under the head, Reserves & Surplus as
         the negative figure.
     l   No change in the format of cash flow statement as per revised schedule and therefore its preparation
         continues to be as per AS-3 i.e. cash flow statement.
     l   It gives prominence to Accounting Standards (AS), i.e., in case of any conflict between the AS and the
         Schedule, AS shall prevail.

 GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PREPARATION OF BALANCE SHEET AND PROFIT AND
 LOSS ACCOUNT
[Financial Statements for a company whose Financial Statements are required to comply wih the Companies
(Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006 - Division I]
The Schedule III sets out minimum requirements for disclosure on the face of the Balance Sheet, and the
Statement of Profit and Loss and Notes. Line items, sub-line items and sub-totals shall be presented as an
addition or substitution on the face of the Financial Statements when such presentation is relevant to an
understanding of the company’s financial position or performance or to cater to industry/sector-specific
disclosure requirements or when required for compliance with the amendments to the Companies Act or under
the Accounting Standards. This means new line items or sub-items can be added or substituted on the face of
the Financial Statements when such presentation is:
       l   Relevant to an understanding of the company’s financial position or performance or to cater to industry/
           sector-specific disclosure requirements.
       l   To cater to industry/sector-specific disclosure requirements or when required for compliance with the
           amendments to the Companies Act.
       l   Under the Accounting Standards.
Where compliance with the requirements of the Act including Accounting Standards as applicable to the
companies require any change in treatment or disclosure including addition, amendment, substitution or
deletion in the head or sub-head or any changes, inter se, in the financial statements or statements forming part
thereof, the same shall be made and the requirements of this Schedule shall stand modified accordingly.
The disclosure requirements specified in this Schedule are in addition to and not in substitution of the disclosure
requirements specified in the Accounting Standards prescribed under the Companies Act, 2013. Additional
disclosures specified in the Accounting Standards shall be made in the notes to accounts or by way of additional
statement unless required to be disclosed on the face of the Financial Statements. Similarly, all other disclosures
as required by the Companies Act shall be made in the notes to accounts in addition to the requirements set out
in this Schedule.
Notes to accounts shall contain information in addition to that presented in the Financial Statements and shall
provide where required
       l   Narrative descriptions or disaggregation of items recognized in those statements; and
       l   Information about items that do not qualify for recognition in those statements.
Each item on the face of the Balance Sheet and Statement of Profit and Loss shall be cross-referenced to
any related information in the notes to accounts. In preparing the Financial Statements including the notes to
accounts, a balance shall be maintained between providing excessive detail that may not assist users of financial
statements and not providing important information as a result of too much aggregation.
Depending upon the Total income of the company, the figures appearing in the Financial Statements shall be
rounded off as given below:

           Total Income                             Rounding off

 (a)       less than one hundred crore rupees       To the nearest hundreds, thousands, lakhs or millions, or
                                                    decimals thereof.

 (b)       one hundred crore rupees or more         To the nearest lakhs, millions or crores, or decimals thereof.


                                                                                                                 35

Once a unit of measurement is used, it should be used uniformly in the Financial Statements.
Except in the case of the first Financial Statements laid before the Company (after its incorporation) the
corresponding amounts (comparatives) for the immediately preceding reporting period for all items shown in
the Financial Statements including notes shall also be given.

 PRESENTATION OF BALANCE SHEET
A Balance Sheet is a statement of the financial position of an enterprise as at a given date, which exhibits its
assets, liabilities, capital, reserves and other account balances at their respective book values.

 How often is a Balance sheet of a company calculated?
 Balance sheet is more like a snapshot of the financial position of a company at a specified time, usually
 calculated after every quarter, six months or one year.

     Special Point: Unamortised portion of share issue expenses, etc.
      1.        Schedule III does not contain any specifies disclosure requirement for the unamortized portion of
                expense items such as Share Issue Expenses, Ancillary Borrowing Costs and Discount or Premium
                relating to Borrowings.
     2.         As per AS-16, Ancillary Borrowing Costs and Discount or Premium relating to Borrowings could be
                amortized over the loan period. Further, share Issue Expenses, Discount on Shares, Ancillary Costs-
                Discount, Premium on Borrowing, etc. being special nature items, are excluded from the scope of
                AS- 26 Intangible Assets.
     3.         Certain companies have taken a view that it is an acceptable practice to amortize these expenses
                over the period of benefit, i.e., normally 3 to 5 years.
     4.         Conclusion: Schedule III does not deal with any accounting treatment of these items, and the same
                continues to be governed by the respective AS / best practices. So, a Company can disclose the
                Unamortized Portion of such expenses as “Unamortized Expenses”, under the head “Other Current/
                Non- Current Assets”, depending on whether the amount will be amortized in the next 12 months or
                thereafter.

Introduction to Corporate Accounting                                                                    LESSON 2

 TRUE AND FAIR VIEW OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
According to Section 128 (1) of the Companies Act, 2013, every company shall prepare and keep its registered
office books of account and other relevant books and papers and financial statements for every financial year
which give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs of the company.
Further Section 129(1) of the Companies Act, 2013, states that the financial statements shall give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the company or companies, comply with the accounting standards notified under
Section 133 and shall be in the form provided for different class or classes of companies in Schedule III.
Thus, the Companies Act requires that the profit and loss account must exhibit a true and fair view of the profit
earned or loss suffered by the company during the period for which the account has been prepared.

  The term ‘true and fair’ has not been defined nor has it been the subject of any judicial decision. But in
  order to show a true and fair view financial statement (Statement of Profit and Loss and Balance Sheet)
  should not mislead the user about the financial health of organization.

From the accounting point of view, the profit and loss account should be drawn upon the principles stated
below:
   (a)   Materiality: All significant factors which will have an impact on the mind of the reader should be
         disclosed.
  		         For example, if a large quantity of raw materials is sold and there is a amount of profit or loss,
             the sale should not be included in the Sales Account; instead, the cost of the materials should be
             deducted from materials consumed and the profit or loss on the sale of raw materials should
             be separately disclosed in the profit and loss account. The reader will then know why the profit
             or loss occurred and how much it was; the reason will not be clear if the sale of raw materials is
             added to Sales or deducted from materials consumed. If, however, only a small quantity was sold
             leading to a rather insignificantprofit or loss, separate disclosure is not necessary because such
             a disclosure will not change the impression of the reader about the profit situation.
		 What is material does not depend upon the judgment of the management. But the materiality of a figure
   should be judged from the point of view of both the total amount of the item and the amount of the profit
   or loss. In the above example, materiality has to be seen from the point of view of :
          (i) the amount of materials consumed and
          (ii)   the profit or loss during the year.
   (b)   Prior-Period Items: The rule in India is that once accounts are adopted at the annual general meeting,
         they cannot be reopened. If any error is discovered, it can be corrected only in the accounts of the
         subsequent period. Apart from errors, some of the accounts relating to the previous year may come to
         knowledge or may be ascertained only in the current year.
  			 For example, rates have been revised with effect from October, 2015, but the decision was made
      only in March, 2017, The increased wages for 2016-17 can certainly be added to the 2016-2017
      wages but the increased wages for six months of 2015-2016 will also have to be taken out into
      account. Errors and other items relating to the previous year should be shown separately in the
      profit and loss account, and not clubbed with the item relating to the current year unless the
      concerned amounts are not material. Preferably, errors and prior year items should be stated
      below the line, i.e., in the Profit and Loss Appropriation Account.
   (c)   Extraordinary Items: If expenses or income that do not arise in the ordinary course and are material
         they should be stated separately in the profit and loss account.

                                                                                                                  65

     			 For example, if a fixed asset is sold, its profit or loss has to be shown separately. Another example
         would be speculation loss or profit; yet another would be subsidy received from government for
         operational purposes.
     (d)     Change in Accounting Policies: It is well known that if there is any change in an accounting policy, say
             method of valuation of inventories or of change in depreciation, there has to be a disclosure about the
             fact of change and on profit or loss resulting from such a change.

 XBRL (EXTENSIBLE BUSINESS REPORTING LANGUAGE)
XBRL is a language for the electronic communication of business and financial data which is revolutionizing
business reporting around the world. It provides major benefits in the preparation, analysis and communication
of business information. It offers cost savings, greater efficiency and improved accuracy and reliability to all
those involved in supplying or using financial data. XBRL stands for eXtensible Business Reporting Language. It
is already being put to practical use in a number of countries and implementations of XBRL are growing rapidly
around the world.

 How Does XBRL work?
XBRL makes the data readable, with the help of two documents – Taxonomy and instance document. Taxonomy
defines the elements and their relationships based on the regulatory requirements. Using the taxonomy prescribed
by the regulators, companies need to map their reports, and generate a valid XBRL instance document. The
process of mapping means matching the concepts as reported by the company to the corresponding element
in the taxonomy. In addition to assigning XBRL tag from taxonomy, information like unit of measurement, period
of data, scale of reporting etc., needs to be included in the instance document.

 How do companies create statements in XBRL?
There are a number of ways to create financial statements in XBRL:
       l     XBRL-aware accounting software products are becoming available which will support the export of
             data in XBRL form. These tools allow users to map charts of accounts and other structures to XBRL tags.
       l     Statements can be mapped into XBRL using XBRL software tools designed for this purpose.
       l     Data from accounting databases can be extracted in XBRL format. It is not strictly necessary for an
             accounting software vendor to use XBRL; third party products can achieve the transformation of the
             data to XBRL.
       l     Applications can transform data in particular formats into XBRL. The route which an individual company
             may take will depend on its requirements and the accounting software and systems it currently uses,
             among other factors.

 XBRL filing under the Companies Act, 2013
The following class of companies shall file their financial statements and other documents under section 137 of
the Companies Act with the Registrar in e-form AOC-4 XBRL as per Annexure-I:-
      (i)    Companies listed with stock exchanges in India and their Indian subsidiaries;
     (ii)    Companies having paid up capital of five crore rupees or above;
     (iii)   Companies having turnover of one hundred crore rupees or above;
     (iv)    All companies which are required to prepare their financial statements in accordance with Companies
             (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015.

The companies preparing their financial statements under the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006
shall file the statements using the Taxonomy provided in Annexure-II and companies preparing their financial
statements under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, shall file the statements using the
Taxonomy provided in Annexure-II A. However, non-banking financial companies, housing finance companies
and companies engaged in the business of banking and insurance sector are exempted from filing of financial
statements under these rules.
The companies which have filed their financial statements under above rule shall continue to file their financial
statements and other documents though they may not fall under the class of companies specified therein in
succeeding years.
The companies which have filed their financial statements under the erstwhile rules, namely the Companies
(Filing of Documents and Forms in Extensible Business Reporting Language) Rules, 2011, shall continue to file
their financial statements and other documents though they do not fall under the class of companies specified
therein.

 Benefits of XBRL
XBRL increases the usability of financial statement information. The need to re-key financial data for analytical
and other purposes can be eliminated. By presenting its statements in XBRL, a company can benefit investors
and all other stakeholders and enhance its profile. It meets the requirements of regulators, lenders and others
consumers of financial information, who are increasingly demanding reporting in XBRL. This improves business
relations and lead to a range of benefits.
All types of organizations can use XBRL to save costs and improve efficiency in handling business and
financial information. Because XBRL is extensible and flexible, it can be adapted to a wide variety of different
requirements. All participants in the financial information supply chain can benefit, whether they are preparers,
transmitters or users of business data.
XBRL offers major benefits at all stages of business reporting and analysis. The benefits are seen in automation,
cost saving, faster, more reliable and more accurate handling of data, improved analysis and in better quality of
information and decision-making. XBRL enables producers and consumers of financial data to switch resources
away from costly manual processes, typically involving time-consuming comparison, assembly and re-entry
of data. They are able to concentrate effort on analysis, aided by software which can validate and process
XBRL information. XBRL is a flexible language, which is intended to support all current aspects of reporting in
different countries and industries. Its extensible nature means that it can be adjusted to meet particular business
requirements, even at the individual organization level.
XBRL benefits comparability by helping to identify data which is genuinely alike and distinguishing information
which is not comparable. Computers can process this information and populate both pre defined and customized
reports.
With full adoption of XBRL, companies can automate data collection. For example, data from different company
divisions with different accounting systems can be assembled quickly, cheaply and efficiently. Once data is
gathered in XBRL, different types of reports using varying subsets of the data can be produced with minimum
effort. A company finance division, for example, could quickly and reliably generate internal management
reports, financial statements for publication, tax and other regulatory filings, as well as credit reports for lenders.
Not only can data handling be automated, removing time-consuming, error-prone processes, but the data can
be checked by software for accuracy.

 INTRODUCTION - ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
Accounting Standards are written policy documents issued by expert accounting body or by the government
or other regulatory body covering the aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of
accounting transactions in financial statements.




This point may be explained as under:
      (i)    Recognition of transactions and other events: Recognition is the process of incorporating an item in
             the Balance Sheet and statement of Profit and Loss. It involves the depiction of an item in words and
             by a monetary amount and inclusion of that amount in the totals of the Balance Sheet and Statement
             of Profit and Loss. The Accounting standards tell us which items to recognize in the Balance sheet and
             which ones in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
     (ii)    Measurement of the transactions and other events: Accounting standards also provide guidance as
             to what monetary amount should be allocated to the transaction and events i.e. these help in the
             measurement or quantification of the items of transactions and events. For example, Accounting
             Standard (AS) 10 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ provides that for the initial recognition of an item of
             PPE, the costs of the items to be considered are (a) Purchase price less trade discount and rebates;
             (b) Non-refundable purchase taxes; (c) Import duties; (d) Directly attributable cost to bring the asset in
             the location and condition for operation as intended by the management.
     (iii)   Presentation of transactions and other events: Accounting Standards also deal with the manner of
             presentation of transactions and other events in the Balance Sheet and Statement of Profit and Loss.
             For Example, paragraphs 8 to 17 of Accounting Standard 3 ‘Cash Flow Statements’ deal with the manner
             of presentation of operating activities, investing and financing activities in the cash flow statement.
     (iv)    Disclosure of transactions and other events: Accounting standards also deal with the manner of
             disclosure of transactions and other events in the financial statements. For example, paragraph 37 of
             the AS 10 provides that in the financial statements, gross and net carrying amounts of the items of PPE
             at the beginning and end of an accounting period showing additions, disposals, acquisitions and other
             movements should be disclosed separately.
It may be noted that almost all the Accounting Standards deal with recognition, measurement, presentation and
disclosure of transactions and other events in the Financial Statements.

 NEED OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The accounting standards seek to describe the accounting principles, valuation techniques and the methods
of applying these accounting principles in the preparation and presentation of the financial statements so that
they represent a true and fair view of the financial position and financial performance of the enterprise. The
ostensible purpose of the standards setting bodies is to promote the dissemination of the timely and useful
financial information to the users. The need of Accounting Standards may be enumerated as under:
   (i)    Improvement of credibility and reliability of financial statements: The accounting standards create an
          environment of confidence among the users of accounting information by providing a uniform structure
          of uniform guidelines which provide credibility and reliability to the accounting information. In this way,
          the financial statements present a true and fair view of the financial position and financial performance
          of an entity.
   (ii)   Comparability of financial Statements made easy: The value of the accounting information is enhanced
          if the same may be compared in the same line of business activity. But, the comparability is possible
          only if the same accounting standards are used in the preparation of the financial statements of the
          different enterprises in the same industry. It is a positive step to protect the interests of the users of the
          accounting information.
  (iii)   Benefits to the accountants and auditors: The accounting standards provide a basis for the uniform
          accounting principles. Due to this reason, there is a less possibility of frauds being committed by the
          accountant. There is more transparency in the accounting information. Since the accounting profession
          follows the accounting standards without any exception, they are helpful not only to the accounting
          entity but also to the accountants and the auditors. Any type of misinformation can lead to a strict
          action against the accountants and the auditors.
  (iv)    Additional disclosures: There are certain areas where the important information is not required to be
          disclosed by the law. The accounting standards require the disclosure of such matters such as the
          method of depreciation and the change in the method of depreciation which help the users of the
          financial statements to take important financial decision.
   (v)    Evaluation of the managerial ability: Accounting standards are useful in measuring the efficiency of
          the management regarding profitability, liquidity, solvency and other general areas of progress of the
          enterprise. In the absence of Accounting Standards, it would be difficult to evaluate the managerial
          efficiency because there is no basis to compare the financial statements of one enterprise with those
          of another. Each enterprise would evolve its own rules and standards to suit its own purpose and users
          would, therefore, not be able to get a true and fair view of the functioning of the enterprise.
  (vi)    Helpful to the Government: The Government officials would find the financial information useful for
          economic planning, market analysis and tax collection if the financial statements are based on the
          established accounting standards.

 LIST OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BY ICAI
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India has, so far, issued 32 Accounting Standards. However, the
Accounting Standard 8 “Accounting for Research and Development” was withdrawn subsequent to the issuance
of Accounting Standard 26 “Intangible Assets” and the Accounting Standard 6 “Depreciation Accounting” was
withdrawn subsequent to the issuance of revised Accounting Standard 10 “Property, Plant and Equipment”
including the matters related to depreciation accounting for the old AS 10 “Accounting for Fixed Assets”. The
Accounting Standards 30, 31 and 32 related to “Financial Instruments” have been withdrawn by the ICAI in the
year 2016. Thus, effectively, there are only 27 Accounting Standards at present.

 APPLICABILITY OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
As per paragraph 3.3. of the ‘Preface to the Statements of Accounting Standards’ in the ‘Compendium of
Accounting Standards (Accounting Standards as on July 1, 2019)’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants
of India (ICAI), accounting standards are intended to apply to enterprises (whether organized in corporate, co-
operative or other forms) engaged in commercial, industrial or business activities irrespective of whether it is
profit oriented or it is established for charitable or religious purposes. However, the Accounting Standards
will not apply to the enterprises which carry on only those activities which are not of commercial, industrial or
business nature (e.g. an activity of collecting donations and giving them to flood affected people). Exclusion
of an enterprise from the applicability of Accounting Standards would be permissible only if no part of the
activity of such enterprise is commercial, industrial or business in nature. Even if a very small proportion of the
activities of an enterprise is considered to be commercial, industrial or business in nature, the Accounting Standards
would apply to all its activities including those which are not commercial, industrial or business in nature.
Thus, it may be stated that the Accounting Standards apply to:
   (a)    Sole proprietorship concerns/individuals
   (b)    Partnership firms
   (c)    Societies
   (d)    Trusts
   (e)    Hindu Undivided families
   (f)    Association of Persons (AOP)
   (g)    Body of individuals (BOI)
   (h)    Co-operative societies
    (i)   Companies and LLPs

 Applicability of Accounting Standard to which types of financial statements or reports?
 As per paragraph 3.3 of the ‘Preface to the Statements of Accounting Standards’ in the ‘Compendium
 of Accounting Standards (Accounting Standards as on July 1, 2019)’ issued by the Institute of Chartered
 Accountants of India (ICAI), Accounting Standards apply to the general-purpose financial Statements and
 other financial reporting which are subject to attest functions of the members of the ICAI. As per paragraph
 3.4 of the said preface, the term ‘General purpose Financial Statements’ includes ‘Balance Sheet’, ‘Statement
 of Profit and Loss’, ‘A Cash Flow Statement’ (where applicable), and Statements and explanatory notes which
 form part thereof issued for the use of various stakeholders, government and their agencies and the public
 at large.

ACCOUNTING STANDARD AND AUDITORS
It is the duty of the auditors that while discharging their function, they ensure that the Accounting Standards
issued and made mandatory by the Central Government are compiled with. Section 143(3)(e) of the Companies
Act, 2013 requires the auditor to report whether in his opinion, the financial statements comply with the
Accounting Standards referred in section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013.

ACCOUNTING STANDARD AND BOARD’S REPORT
Section 134(5)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 states that Directors Responsibility Statement should include that

 Conflict between Act and Accounting Standards
 In case there is any conflict between provisions of any applicable Act and Accounting Standard (AS), the
 provisions of the Act shall prevail to that extent.

                                  OVERVIEW OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

     AS            Deals with                                             Details

     AS 1   Disclosure of Accounting    Accounting policies are the specific accounting principles and the
                    Policies            methods of applying those principles adopted by an enterprise
                                        in the preparation and presentation of financial statements. All
                                        significant accounting policies should be disclosed. Such disclosure
                                        form part of financial statements. All disclosures should be made
                                        at one place. Specific disclosure for the adoption of fundamental
                                        accounting assumptions is not required. Disclosure of accounting
                                        policies cannot remedy a wrong or inappropriate treatment of the
                                        item in the accounts.

 AS 2       Valuation of Inventories    A primary issue in accounting for inventories is the determination of
                                        the value at which inventories are carried in the financial statements
                                        until the related revenues are recognized. This Standard deals with
                                        the determination of such value, including the ascertainment of cost of
                                        inventories and any write-down thereof to net realizable value.

Accounting Standards (AS)                                                                               LESSON 3

                                       Inventories should be valued at the lower of cost and net realizable
                                       value. The cost of inventories should comprise- All costs of purchase
                                          (a)   Costs of conversion
                                          (b)   Other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present
                                                location and condition.

  AS 3      Cash Flow Statements       The Standard deals with the provision of information about the
                                       historical changes in cash and cash equivalents of an enterprise by
                                       means of a cash flow statement which classifies cash flows during the
                                       period from operating, investing and financing activities. An enterprise
                                       should prepare a cash flow statement and should present it for each
                                       period for which financial statements are presented. Cash Flows are
                                       inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents.
                                       Cash Flow Statement represents the cash flows during the specified
                                       period by operating, investing and financing activities.

  AS 4         Contingencies and       This Standard deals with the treatment in financial statements of:
             Events Occurring After
                                          (a)   contingencies, and
            the Balance Sheet Date
                                          (b)   Events occurring after the balance sheet date.
                                       A contingency is a condition or situation, the ultimate outcome of which,
                                       gain or loss, will be known or determined only on the occurrence, or
                                       non-occurrence, of one or more uncertain future events.
                                       Events occurring after the balance sheet date are those significant
                                       events, both favourable and unfavourable, that occur between the
                                       balance sheet date and the date on which the financial statements are
                                       approved by the Board of Directors in the case of a company, and, by
                                       the corresponding approving authority in the case of any other entity.

  AS 5        Net Profit or Loss for   The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the classification and
            the Period, Prior Period   disclosure of certain items in the statement of profit and loss so that
             Items and Changes in      all enterprises prepare and present such a statement on a uniform
               Accounting Policies     basis. This enhances the comparability of the financial statements
                                       of an enterprise over time and with the financial statements of other
                                       enterprises. Accordingly, this Standard requires the classification and
                                       disclosure of extraordinary and prior period items, and the disclosure
                                       of certain items within profit or loss from ordinary activities. It also
                                       specifies the accounting treatment for changes in accounting estimates
                                       and the disclosures to be made in the financial statements regarding
                                       changes in accounting policies.
                                       This Standard should be applied by an enterprise in presenting profit
                                       or loss from ordinary activities, extraordinary items and prior period
                                       items in the statement of profit and loss, in accounting for changes
                                       in accounting estimates, and in disclosure of changes in accounting
                                       policies.

                                                                                                               81
EP-CA&FM                                                                              Accounting Standards (AS)


     AS 7   Construction Contracts   The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting treatment
                                     of revenue and costs associated with construction contracts.
                                     Because of the nature of the activity undertaken in construction
                                     contracts, the date at which the contract activity is entered into and
                                     the date when the activity is completed usually fall into different
                                     accounting periods. Therefore, the primary issue in accounting for
                                     construction contracts is the allocation of contract revenue and
                                     contract costs to the accounting periods in which construction work
                                     is performed. This Standard uses the recognition criteria established
                                     in the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial
                                     Statements to determine when contract revenue and contract costs
                                     should be recognised as revenue and expenses in the statement of
                                     profit and loss. It also provides practical guidance on the application
                                     of these criteria.
                                     This Standard should be applied in accounting for construction
                                     contracts in the financial statements of contractors.
                                     A construction contract is a contract specifically negotiated for the
                                     construction of an asset or a combination of assets that are closely
                                     interrelated or interdependent in terms of their design, technology and
                                     function or their ultimate purpose or use.

     AS 9   Revenue Recognition      This Standard deals with the bases for recognition of revenue in the
                                     statement of profit and loss of an enterprise. The Standard is concerned
                                     with the recognition of revenue arising in the course of the ordinary
                                     activities of the enterprise from:
                                        (a)   the sale of goods,
                                        (b)   the rendering of services, and
                                        (c)   the use by others of enterprise resources yielding interest,
                                              royalties and dividends.

                                     Revenue is the gross inflow of cash, receivables or other consideration
                                     arising in the course of the ordinary activities of an enterprise from
                                     the sale of goods, from the rendering of services, and from the use
                                     by others of enterprise resources yielding interest, royalties and
                                     dividends. Revenue is measured by the charges made to customers or
                                     clients for goods supplied and services rendered to them and by the
                                     charges and rewards arising from the use of resources by them. In an
                                     agency relationship, the revenue is the amount of commission and not
                                     the gross inflow of cash, receivables or other consideration.

 AS 10       Property, Plant and     Property, plant and equipment are tangible items that are held for use
                 Equipment           in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to other or
                                     for administrative services. The objective of this AS is to prescribe the
                                     accounting treatment for property, plant and equipment. The principal
                                     issues in accounting for property, plant and equipment are the
                                     recognition of the assets, determination of their carrying amounts and

                                     depreciation charges and recognition of impairment losses in relation
                                     to them. Under this AS, property, plant and equipment are initially
                                     recognized at cost, subsequently measured by using either cost model
                                     or revaluation model and depreciated so that its depreciable amount
                                     is allocated on a systematic basis over its useful life.

  AS 11     The Effects of Changes   An enterprise may carry on activities involving foreign exchange in two
             in Foreign Exchange     ways. It may have transactions in foreign currencies or it may have
                     Rates           foreign operations. In order to include foreign currency transactions
                                     and foreign operations in the financial statements of an enterprise,
                                     transactions must be expressed in the enterprise’s reporting currency
                                     and the financial statements of foreign operations must be translated
                                     into the enterprise’s reporting currency.
                                     This Standard should be applied:
                                        (a)   in accounting for transactions in foreign currencies; and
                                        (b)   in translating the financial statements of foreign operations

  AS 12         Accounting for       This Standard deals with accounting for Government Grants.
              Government Grants      Government grants are sometimes called by other names such as
                                     subsidies, cash incentives, duty drawbacks, etc.
                                     Government grants are assistance by government in cash or kind to
                                     an enterprise for past or future compliance with certain conditions.
                                     They exclude those forms of government assistance which cannot
                                     reasonably have a value placed upon them and transactions with
                                     government which cannot be distinguished from the normal trading
                                     transactions of the enterprise.
                                     The receipt of government grants by an enterprise is significant for
                                     preparation of the financial statements for two reasons. Firstly, if
                                     a government grant has been received, an appropriate method of
                                     accounting therefor is necessary. Secondly, it is desirable to give an
                                     indication of the extent to which the enterprise has benefited from such
                                     grant during the reporting period. This facilitates comparison of an
                                     enterprise’s financial statements with those of prior periods and with
                                     those of other enterprises.

  AS 13         Accounting for       This Standard deals with accounting for investments in the financial
                 Investments         statements of enterprises and related disclosure requirements.
                                     Investments are assets held by an enterprise for earning income by
                                     way of dividends, interest, and rentals, for capital appreciation, or for
                                     other benefits to the investing enterprise. Assets held as stock-in-trade
                                     are not ‘investments’.
                                     Enterprises hold investments for diverse reasons. For some
                                     enterprises, investment activity is a significant element of operations,
                                     and assessment of the performance of the enterprise may largely, or
                                     solely, depend on the reported results of this activity.



                                                                                                              83

                               An enterprise should disclose current investments and long term
                               investments distinctly in its financial statements. Further classification
                               of current and long-term investments should be as specified in
                               the statute governing the enterprise. In the absence of a statutory
                               requirement, such further classification should disclose, where
                               applicable, investments in:
                                  (a)   Government or Trust securities
                                  (b)   Shares, debentures or bonds
                                  (c)   Investment properties

 AS 14      Accounting for     This standard deals with accounting for amalgamations and the
            Amalgamations      treatment of any resultant goodwill or reserves. This standard is
                               directed principally to companies although some of its requirements
                               also apply to financial statements of other enterprises.
                               According to this Standard, amalgamation means an amalgamation
                               pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 or any other
                               statute which may be applicable to companies.
                               An amalgamation may be either – (a) an amalgamation in the nature of
                               merger, or (b) an amalgamation in the nature of purchase.

 AS 15     Employee Benefits   The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting and
                               disclosure for employee benefits. The Standard requires an enterprise
                               to recognise:
                                   l    a liability when an employee has provided service in exchange
                                        for employee benefits to be paid in the future; and
                                   l    an expense when the enterprise consumes the economic
                                        benefit arising from service provided by an employee in
                                        exchange for employee benefits.
                               Employee benefits are all forms of consideration given by an enterprise
                               in exchange for service rendered by employees.

 AS 16      Borrowing Costs    The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting treatment
                               for borrowing costs.
                               Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred by an enterprise in
                               connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs that are directly
                               attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying
                               asset should be capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. The amount
                               of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation should be determined
                               in accordance with this Standard. Other borrowing costs should be
                               recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
                               The financial statements should disclose: (a) the accounting policy
                               adopted for borrowing costs; and (b) the amount of borrowing costs
                               capitalised during the period.

  AS 17       Segment Reporting   The objective of this Standard is to establish principles for reporting
                                  financial information, about the different types of products and
                                  services an enterprise produces and the different geographical
                                  areas in which it operates. Such information helps users of financial
                                  statements:
                                      l   better understand the performance of the enterprise;
                                      l   better assess the risks and returns of the enterprise; and
                                      l   make more informed judgements about the enterprise as a
                                          whole.
                                  If a single financial report contains both consolidated financial
                                  statements and the separate financial statements of the parent,
                                  segment information need be presented only on the basis of the
                                  consolidated financial statements.
                                  In the context of reporting of segment information in consolidated
                                  financial statements, the references in this Standard to any financial
                                  statement items should construed to be the relevant item as appearing
                                  in the consolidated financial statements.

  AS 18          Related Party    The objective of this Standard is to establish requirements for disclosure
                  Disclosures     of:
                                      l   related party relationships; and
                                      l   transactions between a reporting enterprise and its related
                                          parties.
                                  This Standard should be applied in reporting related party relationships
                                  and transactions between a reporting enterprise and its related parties.
                                  The requirements of this Standard apply to the financial statements of
                                  each reporting enterprise as also to consolidated financial statements
                                  presented by a holding company.

  AS 19              Leases       The objective of this Standard is to prescribe, for lessees and lessors,
                                  the appropriate accounting policies and disclosures in relation to
                                  finance leases and operating leases. This Standard should be applied
                                  in accounting for all leases other than:
                                      l   lease agreements to explore for or use natural resources, such
                                          as oil, gas, timber, metals and other mineral rights;
                                      l   licensing agreements for items such as motion picture films,
                                          video recordings, plays, manuscripts, patents and copyrights;
                                          and

 AS 20       Earnings per Share      The objective of this Standard is to prescribe principles for the
                                     determination and presentation of earnings per share which will
                                     improve comparison of performance among different enterprises
                                     for the same period and among different accounting periods for the
                                     same enterprise. The focus of this Standard is on the denominator of
                                     the earnings per share calculation. Even though earnings per share
                                     data has limitations because of different accounting policies used
                                     for determining ‘earnings’, a consistently determined denominator
                                     enhances the quality of financial reporting.
                                     This Standard should be applied by all companies. However, a Small
                                     and Medium Sized Company, as defined in the Notification may not
                                     disclose diluted earnings per share (both including and excluding
                                     extraordinary items).
                                     In consolidated financial statements, the information required by this
                                     Statement should be presented on the basis of consolidated information.

 AS 21     Consolidated Financial    The objective of this Standard is to lay down principles and procedures
                Statements           for preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements.
                                     Consolidated financial statements are presented by a parent (also known
                                     as holding enterprise) to provide financial information about the economic
                                     activities of its group. These statements are intended to present financial
                                     information about a parent and its subsidiary (ies) as a single economic
                                     entity to show the economic resources controlled by the group, the
                                     obligations of the group and results the group achieves with its resources.
                                     This Standard should be applied in the preparation and presentation
                                     of consolidated financial statements for a group of enterprises under
                                     the control of a parent.
                                     This Standard should also be applied in accounting for investments in
                                     subsidiaries in the separate financial statements of a parent.

 AS 22     Accounting for Taxes on   The objective of this Standard is to prescribe accounting treatment
                  Income             for taxes on income. Taxes on income is one of the significant items
                                     in the statement of profit and loss of an enterprise. In accordance
                                     with the matching concept, taxes on income are accrued in the same
                                     period as the revenue and expenses to which they relate. Matching
                                     of such taxes against revenue for a period poses special problems
                                     arising from the fact that in a number of cases, taxable income may
                                     be significantly different from the accounting income. This divergence
                                     between taxable income and accounting income arises due to two
                                     main reasons. Firstly, there are differences between items of revenue
                                     and expenses as appearing in the statement of profit and loss and the
                                     items which are considered as revenue, expenses or deductions for
                                     tax purposes. Secondly, there are differences between the amount in
                                     respect of a particular item of revenue or expense as recognised in the
                                     statement of profit and loss.

                                     This Standard should be applied in accounting for taxes on income.
                                     This includes the determination of the amount of the expense or saving
                                     related to taxes on income in respect of an accounting period and the
                                     disclosure of such an amount in the financial statements.
 AS 23         Accounting for        The objective of this Standard is to set out principles and procedures
               Investments in        for recognising, in the consolidated financial statements, the effects of
                Associates in        the investments in associates on the financial position and operating
            Consolidated Financial   results of a group.
                 Statements
                                     This Standard should be applied in accounting for investments in
                                     associates in the preparation and presentation of consolidated
                                     financial statements by an investor.
 AS 24           Discontinuing       The objective of this Standard is to establish principles for reporting
                  Operations         information about discontinuing operations, thereby enhancing the
                                     ability of users of financial statements to make projections of an
                                     enterprise’s cash flows, earnings-generating capacity, and financial
                                     position by segregating information about discontinuing operations
                                     from information about continuing operations.
                                     This Standard applies to all discontinuing operations of an enterprise.
                                     The requirements related to cash flow statement contained in this
                                     Standard are applicable where an enterprise prepares and presents
                                     a cash flow statement.
 AS 25         Interim Financial     The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the minimum content of an
                   Reporting         interim financial report and to prescribe the principles for recognition
                                     and measurement in complete or condensed financial statements
                                     for an interim period. Timely and reliable interim financial reporting
                                     improves the ability of investors, creditors, and others to understand an
                                     enterprise’s capacity to generate earnings and cash flows, its financial
                                     condition and liquidity.
                                     This Standard does not mandate which enterprises should be required to
                                     present interim financial reports, how frequently, or how soon after the end
                                     of an interim period. If an enterprise is required or elects to prepare and
                                     present an interim financial report, it should comply with this Standard.

 AS 26         Intangible Assets     The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting treatment
                                     for intangible assets that are not dealt with specifically in another
                                     Accounting Standard. This Standard requires an enterprise to recognise
                                     an intangible asset if, and only if, certain criteria are met. The Standard
                                     also specifies how to measure the carrying amount of intangible assets
                                     and requires certain disclosures about intangible assets.
                                     This Standard should be applied by all enterprises in accounting for
                                     intangible assets, except:
                                        (a)   intangible assets that are covered by another Accounting

                                            similar non-regenerative resources; and
                                      (d)   intangible assets arising in insurance enterprises from
                                            contracts with policyholders.
                                   An intangible asset should be recognised if, and only if:
                                      (a)   it is probable that the future economic benefits that are
                                            attributable to the asset will flow to the enterprise; and
                                      (b)   the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
                                   An enterprise should assess the probability of future economic benefits
                                   using reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent best
                                   estimate of the set of economic conditions that will exist over the useful
                                   life of the asset.

 AS 27     Financial Reporting     The objective of this Standard is to set out principles and procedures for
           of Interests in Joint   accounting for interests in joint ventures and reporting of joint venture
                 Ventures          assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the financial statements of
                                   venturers and investors.
                                   This Standard should be applied in accounting for interests in joint
                                   ventures and the reporting of joint venture assets, liabilities, income
                                   and expenses in the financial statements of venturers and investors,
                                   regardless of the structures or forms under which the joint venture
                                   activities take place.

 AS 28     Impairment of Assets    The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the procedures that an
                                   enterprise applies to ensure that its assets are carried at no more
                                   than their recoverable amount. An asset is carried at more than its
                                   recoverable amount if its carrying amount exceeds the amount to be
                                   recovered through use or sale of the asset. If this is the case, the asset
                                   is described as impaired and this Standard requires the enterprise to
                                   recognise an impairment loss. This Standard also specifies when an
                                   enterprise should reverse an impairment loss and it prescribes certain
                                   disclosures for impaired assets.
                                   This Standard should be applied in accounting for the impairment of
                                   all assets, other than:
                                      (a)   inventories (see AS 2, Valuation of Inventories);
                                      (b)   assets arising from construction contracts (see AS 7,
                                            Construction Contracts);
                                      (c)   financial assets, including investments that are included in the
                                            scope of AS 13, Accounting for Investments; and deferred tax
                                            assets (see AS 22, Accounting for Taxes on Income).

         AS) Amendment Rules, 2016 dated 30th March, 2016.
		 Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) are another set of accounting standards notified by the Ministry
   of Corporate Affairs, Government of India which are converged with International Financial Reporting
   Standards (IFRS). These accounting standards are formulated by Accounting Standards Board of
   Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). The Ind ASs are named and numbered in the same
   way as the corresponding IFRS. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has notified 41 Ind ASs as
   Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended by Companies (Indian Accounting
   Standards) Amendments Rules, 2016.

 NEED FOR CONVERGENCE WITH GLOBAL STANDARDS
The last decade has witnessed a sea change in the global economic scenario. The emergence of transnational
corporations in search of money, not only for fuelling growth, but to sustain ongoing activities has necessitated
raising of capital from all parts of the world, cutting across frontiers.
Each country has its own set of rules and regulations for accounting and financial reporting. Therefore, when
an enterprise decides to raise capital from the markets other than the country in which it is located, the rules
and regulations of that other country apply, and this, in turn, will require that the enterprise is in a position to
understand the differences between the rules governing financial reporting in the foreign country as compared
to its own country of origin. Therefore, translation and re-instatements are of utmost importance in a world that
is rapidly globalizing in all ways. In themselves also, the Accounting Standards and principle need to be robust
so that the larger society develops degree of confidence in the financial statements, which are put forward by
organizations.
International analysts and investors would like to compare financial statements based on similar Accounting
Standards, and this has led to the growing support for an internationally accepted set of Accounting Standards

                                                                                                                 89
EP-CA&FM                                                                                    Accounting Standards (AS)

for cross-border filings. The harmonization of financial reporting around the world will help to raise confidence
of investors generally in the information they are using to make their decisions and assess their risks.
Also a strong need was felt by legislation to bring about uniformity, rationalization, comparability, transparency
and adaptability in financial statements. Having a multiplicity of Accounting Standards around the world is
against the public interest. If accounting for the same events and information produces different reported
numbers, depending on the system of standards that are being used, it is self-evident that accounting will be
increasingly discredited in the eyes of those using the numbers. It creates confusion, encourages error and
facilitates fraud. The cure for these ills is to have a single set of global standards, of the highest quality, set in
the interest of public. Global Standards facilitate cross-border flow of money, global listing in different bourses
and comparability of financial statements.
The convergence of financial reporting and Accounting Standards is a valuable process that contributes to
the free flow of global investment and achieves substantial benefits for all capital market stakeholders. It
improves the ability of investors to compare investments on a global basis and thus lowers their risk of errors
of judgment. It facilitates accounting and reporting for companies with global operations and eliminates some
costly requirements reinstatement of financial statements. It has the potential to create a new standard of
accountability and greater transparency, which are values of great significance to all market participants,
including regulators. It reduces operational challenges for accounting firms and focuses their value and
expertise around an increasingly unified set of standards. It creates an unprecedented opportunity for standard
setters and other stakeholders to improve the reporting model. For the companies with joint listings in both
domestic and foreign country, the convergence is very much significant.

 INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS) AS GLOBAL STANDARDS
With a view of achieving these objectives, the London-based group namely the International Accounting
Standards Committee (IASC), responsible for developing International Accounting Standards, was established
in June, 1973. It is presently known as International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The IASC comprises the
professional accountancy bodies of over 75 countries (including the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India).
Primarily, the IASC was established, in the public interest, to formulate and publish, International Accounting
Standards to be followed in the presentation of audited financial statements. International Accounting Standards
were issued to promote acceptance and observance of International Accounting Standards worldwide. The
members of IASC have undertaken a responsibility to support the standards promulgated by IASC and to
propagate those standards in their respective countries.
Between 1973 and 2001, the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) released International
Accounting Standards. Between 1997 and 1999, the IASC restructured their organization, which resulted in the
formation of International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). These changes came into effect on 1st April, 2001.
Subsequently, IASB issued statements about current and future standards: IASB publishes its Standards in a series
of pronouncements called International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). However, IASB has not rejected the
standards issued by the IASC. Those pronouncements continue to be designated as “International Accounting
Standards” (IAS). The IASB approved IASB Resolution on IASC Standards at their meeting in April, 2001, in which
it confirmed the status of all IASC Standards and SIC Interpretations in would come into effect on 1st April, 2001.
The term IFRS comprises IFRS issued by IASB, IAS issued by International Accounting Standards Committee
(IASC), and Interpretations issued by the Standard Interpretations Committee (SIC) and the International Financial
Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the IASB. Every major nation is moving towards adopting IFRS
to some extent. Large number of authorities requires public companies to use IFRS for stock- exchange listing
purposes, and in addition, banks, insurance companies and stock exchanges may use them for their statutorily
required reports. The increased use of IFRS is not limited to public-company listing requirements or statutory
reporting. Many lenders and regulatory and government bodies are looking to IFRS to fulfil local financial
reporting obligations related to financing or licensing.

Following are some of the advantages of IFRS:
    l     It would facilitate increased comparability of financial information among companies operating in
          different countries.
    l     The financial reporting process would become more transparent.
    l     The standardization of accounting methodology provides creditors and investors with the ability to
          analyze businesses around the world using the same financial methods.
    l     It would also permit international capital to flow more freely.
    l     It would give investors a better understanding to the financial statements and assess the investment
          opportunities in other countries.
    l     It would also benefit the accounting professionals as they will be able to sell their services in the
          different parts of the world.
All these benefits of IFRS have prompted many countries to pursue convergence of national Accounting Standards
with IFRS. India has also decided to facilitate the convergence of the Indian Accounting Standards with IFRS
and in this direction all existing Accounting Standards are being revised and converged with corresponding IAS/
IFRS. Convergence of entire world towards IFRS would benefit the corporate sector, investors, regulators and
facilitate economic growth as a whole.

 CONVERGENCE OF ACCOUNTING STANDARD WITH IFRS IN INDIA

                                                    WHY IFRS?
 The IFRSs are important because of their following features:
     a.    Single set of Accounting Standards would enable internationally to standardize and assure better
           quality on a global screen.
     b.    It would also permit international capital to flow more freely, enabling companies to develop
           consistent global practices on accounting problems.
     c.    It would be beneficial to the regulators too, as the complexity associated with needing to understand
           various reporting regimes would be reduced.

           opportunities other than their Home Country.
     e.    It also benefits the accounting professionals in a way that they will be able to sell their services in

 Ind AS      Business     The objective of this Indian Accounting Standard is to improve the relevance,
   103     Combinations   reliability and comparabilityof the information that a reporting entity provides
                          in its financial statements about a business combination and its effects. To
                          accomplish that, this Indian Accounting Standard establishes principles and
                          requirements for how the acquirer:
                             (a)    recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable
                                    assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling
                                    interest in the acquiree;
                             (b)    recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business
                                    combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and
                             (c)    determines what information to disclose to enable users of the
                                    financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of
                                    the business combination.
                          This Indian Accounting Standard applies to a transaction or other event
                          that meets the definition of a business combination. This Indian Accounting
                          Standard does not apply to:
                             (a)    the formation of a joint venture.
                             (b)    the acquisition of an asset or a group of assets that does not constitute
                                    a business. In such cases the acquirer shall identify and recognize
                                    the individual identifiable assets acquired (including those assets
                                    that meet the definition of, and recognition criteria for, intangible
                                    assets in Ind AS 38 Intangible Assets) and liabilities assumed. The
                                    cost of the group shall be allocated to the individual identifiable
                                    assets and liabilities on the basis of their relative fair values at the
                                    date of purchase. Such a transaction or event does not give rise to
                                    goodwill.
                             (c)    Appendix C deals with accounting for combination of entities or
                                    businesses under common control.
                          A business combination is a transaction or other event in which an acquirer
                          obtains control of one or more businesses. Transactions sometimes referred
                          to as ‘true mergers’ or ‘mergers of equals’ are also referred to as business

                                Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement.
                                For some assets and liabilities, observable market transactions or market
                                information might be available. For other assets and liabilities, observable
                                market transactions and market information might not be available. However,
                                the objective of a fair value measurement in both cases is the same - to
                                estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset or to
                                transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the
                                measurement date under current market conditions (i.e. an exit price at the
                                measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds
                                the asset or owes the liability).
                                Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
                                transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between the market participants
                                at the measurement date.

                               course of an entity’s ordinary activities. Income is increases in economic
                               benefits during the accounting period in the form of inflows or enhancements
                               of assets or decreases of liabilities that result in increases in equity, other
                               than the contributions from equity participants.

  Ind AS          Leases       The objective of this Ind AS is to set out the principles for recognition,
    116                        measurement, presentation of disclosure of leases so that the lessees and
                               lessors provide the relevant information in a manner that faithfully represent
                               those transactions. This information gives a basis for users of financial
                               statements to assess the effect that leases have on the financial position,
                               financial performance and cash flows of an entity.
                               In additions to normal leases, the Standard also covers lease liability in sale
                               and lease back transactions.
                               To apply this standard, an entity shall consider the terms and conditions of
                               contracts and all relevant facts and circumstances. An entity shall apply this
                               Standard consistently to contracts with similar characteristics and in similar
                               circumstances.
                               A lease is a contract, or part of a contract that conveys the right to use
                               an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for
                               consideration.

  Ind AS         Insurance     Ind AS 117 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation
    117          Contracts     and disclosure of Insurance Contracts within the scope of the standard. The
                               objective of Ind AS 117 is to ensure that an entity provides relevant information
                               that faithfully represents those contracts. This information gives a basis for
                               users of financial statements to assess the effect that insurance contracts
                               have on the entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows.

                          The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has issued Ind AS 117, Insurance
                          Contracts on 12 August 2024.
                          Ind AS 117 applies to all companies i.e it applies to ‘insurance contracts’ ,
                          regardless of the issuer, and therefore all companies are covered and not
                          just insurance companies registered with the insurance Regulatory and
                          Development Authority of India (IRDAI).
                          Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) currently do not apply to entities
                          registered with IRDAI as insurance companies. These companies apply
                          accounting standards notified under the Companies Act,2013 read with
                          relevant guidelines issued by the IRDAI.
                          The MCA, vide its notification dated 28 September 2024, has clarified that an
                          insurer or insurance company may provide its financial statement as per Ind
                          AS 104 for the purposes of consolidated financial statements of its parent or
                          investor or venture till the IRDAI has notified Ind AS 117.
                          An insurance contract is a contract under which one party (the insurer) accepts
                          significant insurance risk from another party (the policyholder) by agreeing
                          to compensate the policyholder if a specified future event (the insured event)
                          adversely affects the policyholder.
 Ind AS    Presentation   This Standard prescribes the basis for presentation of general purpose
    1      of Financial   financial statements to ensure comparability both with the entity’s financial
           Statements     statements of previous periods and with the financial statements of other
                          entities. It sets out overall requirements for the presentation of financial
                          statements, guidelines for their structure and minimum requirements for their
                          contents.
                          An entity shall apply this Standard in preparing and presenting general
                          purpose financial Statements in accordance with Ind AS.
                          General purpose financial statements are those financial statements that
                          are intended to meet the needs of users who are not in a position to
                          require an entity to prepare reports tailored to their particular information
                          needs.
 Ind AS    Inventories    The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting treatment for
    2                     inventories. A primary issue in accounting for inventories is the amount
                          of cost to be recognized as an asset and carried forward until the related
                          revenues are recognized. This Standard deals with the determination of cost
                          and its subsequent recognition as an expense, including any write-down to
                          net realizable value. It also deals with the cost formulas that are used to
                          assign costs to inventories.
                          Inventories are assets:
                             (a)    held for sale in the ordinary course of business;
                             (b)    in the process of production for such sale; or
                             (c)    in the form of materials or supplies to be consumed in the production
                                    process or in the rendering of services.

  Ind AS    Statement of Cash Information about the cash flows of an entity is useful in providing users of
     7            Flows       financial statements with a basis to assess the ability of the entity to generate
                              cash and cash equivalents and the needs of the entity to utilize those cash
                              flows. The economic decisions that are taken by users require an evaluation
                              of the ability of an entity to generate cash and cash equivalents and the
                              timing and certainty of their generation. The objective of this Standard is
                              to require the provision of information about the historical changes in cash
                              and cash equivalents of an entity by means of a statement of cash flows
                              which classifies cash flows during the period from operating, investing and
                              financing activities.

                                 An entity shall prepare a statement of cash flows in accordance with the
                                 requirements of this Standard and shall present it as an integral part of
                                 its financial statements for each period for which financial statements are
                                 presented.
                                 A statement showing cash flows is called a Statement of Cash Flows.
                                 Cash flows are the inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents.
                                 Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents
                                 are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to
                                 known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of
                                 changes in value.

                  Errors         and reliability of an entity’s financial statements and the comparability of
                                 those financial statements over time and with the financial statements of
                                 other entities. Disclosure requirements for accounting policies, except those
                                 for changes in accounting policies, are set out in Ind AS 1 Presentation of

                                 This Standard shall be applied in selecting and applying accounting policies,
                                 and accounting for changes in accounting policies, changes in accounting
                                 estimates and corrections of prior period errors.
                                 Accounting policies are the specific principles, bases, conventions, rules

                                 statements. A change in an accounting estimate is the adjustment in the
                                 carrying amount of an asset or a liability, or the amount of the periodic
                                 consumption of an asset that results from the assessment of the present

 Ind AS    Events after the   The objective of this Standard is to prescribe:
   10      Reporting Period
                                 (a)    When an entity should adjust its financial statements for events after
                                        the reporting period; and
                                 (b)    the disclosures that an entity should give about the date when the
                                        financial statements were approved for issue and about events after
                                        the reporting period.
                              The Standard also requires that an entity should not prepare its financial
                              statements on a going concern basis if events after the reporting period
                              indicate that the going concern assumption is not appropriate.
                              This Standard shall be applied in the accounting for, and disclosure of,
                              events after the reporting period. Events after the reporting period are those
                              events, favourbale and unfavourable, that occurs between the end of the
                              reporting period and that date when the financial statements are approved
                              by the Board of directors in the case of a company and by the corresponding
                              approving authority in the case of any other entity for issue.

 Ind AS     Income Taxes      The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting treatment for
   12                         income tax. The principal issue in accounting for income tax is how to account
                              for the current and future tax consequences of:
                                 (a)    the future recovery (settlement) of the carrying amount of assets
                                        (liabilities) that are recognized in an entity’s balance sheet; and
                                 (b)    transactions and other events of the current period that are
                                        recognized in an entity’s financial statements.
                              It is inherent in the recognition of an asset or liability that the reporting entity
                              expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of that asset or liability. If
                              it is probable that recovery or settlement of that carrying amount will make
                              future tax payments larger (smaller) than they would be if such recovery or
                              settlement were to have no tax consequences. This Standard requires an
                              entity to recognize a deferred tax liability (deferred tax asset), with certain
                              limited exceptions.

 Ind AS    Property, Plant    The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting treatment for
   16      and Equipment      property, plant and equipment so that users of the financial statements
                              can discern information about an entity’s investment in its property, plant
                              and equipment and the changes in such investment. The principal issues
                              in accounting for property, plant and equipment are the recognition of the
                              assets, the determination of their carrying amounts, and the depreciation
                              charges and impairment losses to be recognized in relation to them.
                              This Standard shall be applied in accounting for property, plant and
                              equipment except when another Standard requires or permits a different
                              accounting treatment.

  Ind AS    Employee Benefits The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting and disclosure
    19                        for employee benefits. The Standard requires an entity to recognize:
                                   (a)    a liability when an employee has provided service in exchange for
                                          employee benefits to be paid in the future; and
                                   (b)    an expense when the entity consumes the economic benefit arising
                                          from the service provided by an employee in exchange for employee
                                          benefits.

                                          provide an economic benefit specific to an entity or range of entities
                                          qualifying under certain criteria. Government assistance does not
                                          include benefits provided only indirectly through actions affecting
                                          general trading conditions, such as the provision of infrastructure in
                                          development areas or the imposition of trading constraints on the
                                          competitors. Government grants are assistance by government in the
                                          form of transfer of resources to an entity in return for past or future
                                          compliance with certain conditions relating to the operating activities
                                          of the entity. Government grants exclude those forms of government
                                          assistance which cannot reasonably have a value placed upon them
                                          and transactions with the government which cannot be distinguished
                                          from the trading transactions of the entity.

 Ind AS      The Effects of   An entity may carry on foreign activities in two ways. It may have transactions
   21         Changes in      in foreign currencies or it may have foreign operations. In addition, an entity
           Foreign Exchange   may present its financial statements in a foreign currency. The objective of
                 Rates        this Standard is to prescribe how to include foreign currency transactions
                              and foreign operations in the financial statements of an entity and how to
                              translate financial statements into a presentation currency.
                              The principal issues are which exchange rate(s) to use and how to report the
                              effects of changes in exchange rates in the financial statements.

 Ind AS    Borrowing Costs    Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction
   23                         or production of a qualifying asset form part of the cost of that asset. Other
                              borrowing costs are recognized as an expense.
                              An entity shall apply this Standard in accounting for borrowing costs.
                              The Standard does not deal with the actual or imputed cost of equity,
                              including preferred capital not classified as a liability.
                              An entity is not required to apply the Standard to borrowing costs directly
                              attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of:
                                 (a)    a qualifying asset measured at a fair value, for example, a biological
                                        asset; or
                                 (b)    Inventories that are manufactured or otherwise produced, in large
                                        quantities on a repetitive basis.

 Ind AS     Related Party     The objective of this Standard is to ensure that an entity’s financial statements
   24        Disclosures      contain the disclosures necessary to draw attention to the possibility that its
                              financial position and profit or loss may have been affected by the existence
                              of related parties and by transactions and outstanding balances, including
                              commitments, with such parties.
                              This Standard shall be applied in:
                                 (a)    identifying related party relationships and transactions;
                                 (b)    identifying outstanding balances, including commitments, between
                                        an entity and its related parties;
                                 (c)    identifying the circumstances in which disclosure of the items in (a)
                                        and (b) is required; and
                                 (d)    determining the disclosures to be made about those items.
                              A related party is a person or entity that is related to the entity preparing its
                              financial statements. A related party transaction is a transfer of resources,
                              services or obligations between a reporting entity and a related party
                              regardless of whether the price is charged.

  Ind AS    Separate Financial The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting and disclosure
    27         Statements      requirements for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates
                               when an entity prepares separate financial statements.
                                This Standard shall be applied in accounting for investments in subsidiaries,
                                joint ventures and associates when an entity elects, or is required by law, to
                                present separate financial statements.
                                This Standard does not mandate which entities produce separate financial
                                statements. It applies when an entity prepares separate financial statements
                                that comply with Indian Accounting Standards.
                                Separate financial statements are those presented by a parent (i.e. an investor
                                with control of a subsidiary) or an investor with joint control of, or significant
                                influence over, an investee, in which the investments are accounted for at
                                cost or as per Ind AS 9 “Financial Instruments”.

  Ind AS      Investments in    The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting for investments
    28        Associates and    in associates and to set out the requirements for the application of the equity
              Joint Ventures    method when accounting for investments in associates and joint ventures.
                                This Standard shall be applied by all entities that are investors with joint
                                control of, or significant influence over, an investee.
                                An associate is an entity over which the investor has significant influence. A
                                joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have the joint
                                control of the arrangement has rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

  Ind AS       Financial        This Standard shall be applied to the financial statements, including the

              Economies
                                In a hyperinflationary economy, reporting of operating results and financial
                                position in the local currency without restatement is not useful. Money
                                loses purchasing power at such a rate that comparison of amounts from
                                transactions and other events that have occurred at different times, even
                                within the same accounting period, is misleading.

  Ind AS         Financial      The objective of this Standard is to establish principles for presenting
    32         Instruments:     financial instruments as liabilities or equity and for offsetting financial assets
               Presentation     and financial liabilities. It applies to the classification of financial instruments,
                                from the perspective of the issuer, into financial assets, financial liabilities and
                                equity instruments; the classification of related interest, dividends, losses and
                                gains; and the circumstances in which financial assets and financial liabilities
                                should be offset.
                                The principles in this Standard complement the principles for recognising
                                and measuring financial assets and financial liabilities in Ind AS 39 Financial
                                Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and for disclosing information

 Ind AS    Earnings per Share The objective of this Standard is to prescribe principles for the determination
   33                         and presentation of earnings per share, so as to improve performance
                              comparisons between different entities in the same reporting period and
                              between different reporting periods for the same entity. Even though earnings
                              per share data have limitations because of the different accounting policies
                              that may be used form determining ‘earnings’, a consistently determined
                              denominator enhances financial reporting. The focus of this Standard is on
                              the denominator of the earnings per share calculation.
                                An entity shall calculate basic earnings per share amounts for profit or
                                loss attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the parent entity and, if
                                presented, profit or loss from continuing operations attributable to those
                                equity holders. Basic earnings per share shall be calculated by dividing profit
                                or loss attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the parent entity by the
                                weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
                                An entity shall calculate diluted earnings per share amounts for profit or loss
                                attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the parent entity and, if presented,
                                profit or loss from continuing operations attributable to those equity holders.
                                For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, an entity shall
                                adjust profit or loss attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the parent
                                entity and weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during
                                the period, from the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
 Ind AS     Interim Financial   The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the minimum content of an
   34           Reporting       interim financial report and to prescribe the principles for recognition and
                                measurement in complete or condensed financial statements for an interim
                                period. Timely and reliable interim financial reporting improves the ability of
                                investors, creditors, and others to understand an entity’s capacity to generate
                                earnings and cash flow and its financial condition and liquidity.
                                Interim financial report is a financial report containing either a complete set
                                of financial statements or a set of condensed financial statements for an
                                interim period. An interim period is a financial reporting period shorter than a
                                full financial year.
 Ind AS      Impairment of      The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the procedures that an entity
   36           Assets          applies to ensure that its assets are carried at no more than their recoverable
                                amount. An asset is carried at more than its recoverable amount if its carrying
                                amount exceeds the amount to be recovered through use or sale of the asset.
                                If this is the case, the asset is described as impaired and the Standard requires
                                the entity to recognize an impairment loss. The Standard also specifies when
                                an entity should reverse an impairment loss and prescribes disclosures.
                                An impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of an
                                asset or a cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Carrying
                                amount is the amount at which an asset is reocgnized after deducting any
                                accumulated depreciation (amortization) and any accumulated impairment
                                losses thereon. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of
                                assets that generates cash flows that are largely independent of the cash
                                inflows from other assets or group of assets.

  Ind AS        Provisions,      The objective of this Standard is to ensure that appropriate recognition criteria
    37          Contingent       and measurement bases are applied to provisions, contingent liabilities and
              Liabilities and    contingent assets and that sufficient information is disclosed in the notes to
            Contingent Assets    enable users to understand their nature, timing and amount.
                                 A provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount. A contingent liability is:
                                    a)     a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence
                                           will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one
                                           or more uncertain events not wholly within the control of the entity;
                                           or
                                    b)     a present obligation that arises from past events but is not reocgnized
                                           because:
                                             i. it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying
                                                economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or
                                            ii. the amount of obligation cannot be measured with sufficient
                                                reliability.
                                 A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose
                                 existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one
                                 or more uncertain events not wholly within the control of the entity.

  Ind AS     Intangible Assets   The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting treatment for
    38                           intangible assets that are not dealt with specifically in another Standard.
                                 This Standard requires an entity to recognize an intangible asset if, and only
                                 if, specified criteria are met. The Standard also specifies how to measure
                                 the carrying amount of intangible assets and requires specified disclosures
                                 about intangible assets.
                                 An intangible asset is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical
                                 substance. Monetary assets are money held and assets to be received in
                                 fixed or determinable amount of money. An intangible asset to be identifiable
                                 should be distinguishable from goodwill. An asset is identifiable if it either:
                                    a)     is separable, i.e., is capable of being separated or dividend from the
                                           entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged either

                                  account for the following when they relate to agricultural activity:
                                     a)     biological assets;
                                     b)     agricultural produce at the point of harvest; and
                                      c)    Government grants covered by paragraphs 34 and 35.
                                  Agricultural activity is the management by an entity of the biological
                                  transformation and harvest of biological assets for sale or for conversion into
                                  agricultural produce or into additional biological assets. Agricultural produce
                                  is the harvested produce of the entity’s biological asset. A biological asset is
                                  a living animal or plant. Biological transformation comprises the processes
                                  of growth, degeneration, production, and procreation that cause qualitative
                                  or quantitative changes in a biological asset.

 IFRS VS IGAAP
Indian GAAP is a set of accounting standards that are specifically designed for the Indian context. GAAP stands
for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Most Indian companies follow Indian GAAP while preparing their
accounting records. When a company follows IFRS, it needs to provide a disclosure in the form of a note that it is
complying with the IFRS. But for Indian GAAP, the disclosure of the statement isn’t mandatory. When a company
is said to follow the Indian GAAP, it’s assumed that they’re complying with the Indian GAAP to portray the true
and fair view of their financial affairs.

 MEANING OF SHARES
A share may be understood as an individual part or a singular unit into
which the total share capital of a company is divided. Shares are used
to raise the capital of a company and each share constitutes a unit of              According to Section 2(84)
ownership which is offered for sale. A share represents a part of the share         of the Companies Act,
capital of the company.                                                             2013, “share” means a
                                                                                    share in the share capital
For example, Company ABC has a share capital of Rs. 50,00,000 divided               of a company and its stock.
into 5,00,000 shares of Rs.10 each and Mr. Naveen is in possession of 6,000
shares, then he has a share of Rs. 60,000 in the share capital of the company.

 Meaning of Share Capital
A company, being an artificial person, cannot generate its own capital which has necessarily to be collected
from several persons. These persons are known as shareholders and the amount contributed by them is called
share capital. Since the number of shareholders is very large, a separate capital account cannot be opened for
each one of them. Hence, numerous streams of capital contribution merge into a common Nominal Personal
Account called ‘Share Capital Account’
A company raises capital by issuing of shares to finance and carry on its business. The Memorandum of Association,
which is the charter of the company contains the amount of capital with which the company was registered and
the number of shares into which it is divided. It constitutes the basis of the capital structure of a company. This
amount mentioned in the Memorandum of Association is called Authorized Capital.

 Kinds of Share Capital
The share capital of a company limited by shares can constitute of two kinds of share capital under the
Companies Act, 2013, as follows:

    Equity Share Capital           Equity share capital with reference to any company limited by shares means
                                   all share capital that does not come under preference share capital. Equity
                                   share capital can further be divided into the following types:
                                     (i) with voting rights; or
                                     (ii) with differential rights regarding dividend or voting or any other such
                                          rights.
                                   In other words, shares which do not enjoy any preferential right in the payment
                                   of dividend or repayment of capital, are termed as equity/ordinary shares.
                                   The equity shareholders are entitled to share the distributable profits of the
                                   company after satisfying the dividend rights of the preference share holders.

 Preference Share Capital          Preference, as the name suggests, with reference to any company limited by
                                   shares, refers to that share capital of the issued share capital of the company
                                   which would carry a preferential right with regard to payment of dividend and
                                   Repayment of capital.

 Deemed preference share           The share capital is deemed to be preference share capital, notwithstanding
        capital                    that it is entitled to either or both of the following rights:
                                     l that in respect of dividends, in addition to the preferential rights to the
                                         payment of dividend, it has a right to participate, whether fully or to a
                                         limited extent, with capital not entitled to the preferential right aforesaid;
                                     l that in respect of capital, in addition to the preferential right to the
                                         repayment, in case of a winding up, it has a right to participate, whether
                                         fully or to a limited extent, with capital not entitled to that preferential
                                         right in any surplus which may remain after the entire capital has been
                                         repaid.

The important steps in the procedure of share issue are:
      l   Issue of Prospectus: The Company first issues the prospectus to the public. Prospectus is an invitation
          to the public that a new company has come into existence and it needs funds for doing business.
          It contains complete information about the company and the manner in which the money is to be
          collected from the prospective investors.
      l   Receipt of Applications: When prospectus is issued to the public, prospective investors intending to
          subscribe the share capital of the company would make an application along with the application
          money and deposit the same with a scheduled bank as specified in the prospectus. The company has
          to get minimum subscription within 120 days from the date of the issue of the prospectus. If the company
          fails to receive the same within the said period, the company cannot proceed for the allotment of shares
          and application money should be returned within 130 days of the date of issue of prospectus.
      l   Allotment of Shares: If minimum subscription has been received, the company may proceed for the
          allotment of shares after fulfilling certain other legal formalities. Letters of allotment are sent to those
          whom the shares have been allotted, and letters of regret to those to whom no allotment has been
          made. When allotment is made, it results in a valid contract between the company and the applicants
          who now became the shareholders of the company.

 Terms of Issue of Share




 A. ISSUE OF SHARES AT PAR
Shares are said to be issued at par when the issue price is equal to the face value or nominal value of the shares
i.e., when the issue price is Rs. 10 and face value is also Rs. 10. When the shares are issued, the company may
ask for the payment of the shares either payable in lump sum/single instalment or in multiple installments.
  (a)     When shares are issued at par and are payable in full in a lump sum:

  Additional Points:
        (i)      Although shares may be of either kind, i.e., equity shares or preference shares, if the term shares
                 alone is used it means equity shares.
        (ii)     Separate share application account will be opened for each class of shares, i.e., equity share
                 application account/preference share application account and the like.
     (iii)       The receipt of application money is simply an offer and cannot be credited to Share Capital Account
                 until the shares are allotted by the company.
     (iv)        Refund of application money: If the company fails to raise the minimum subscription, then no shares
                 can be allotted and the application money has to be returned to the applicants. , The entry will be
                 as follows:

  (b)          When shares are issued at par and the amount is payable in installments:
		 When shares are not payable in lump sum/single installment, they can be called in number of
   installments. After allotment, whenever the need arises, the company may require further installments
   from the shareholders towards payment of the value of shares subscribed by them. Such demands are
   termed as ‘calls’. The different calls are distinguished from one another by their serial numbers, i.e., first
   call, second call, third call and so on. The last installment is also termed the final call along with the
   number of the last call.

Accounting for Share Capital                                                                                    LESSON 4

On Application Rs. 3 per share
On Allotment Rs. 2 per share
On First Call (One month after allotment) Rs. 2.50 per share
On Second and Final Call Rs. 2.50 per share
The shares were fully subscribed for by the public and application money duly received. The directors made
the allotment. The Calls were paid by the shareholder. Pass necessary journal entries.

 B. ISSUE OF SHARES AT PREMIUM
It is quite common for the shares of financially strong and well-managed companies to be issued at a premium,
i.e. at an amount more than the nominal or par value of shares. Thus, when a share of the nominal value of Rs.
100 is issued at Rs. 105, it is said to have been issued at a premium of 5 per cent.
When the issue of shares is at a premium, the amount of premium may technically be called at any stage of the
issue of shares. However, premium is generally called with the amount due on allotment, sometimes with the
application money and rarely with the call money. The premium amount is credited to a separate account called
‘Securities Premium Account’ and is shown under the title ‘Equity and Liabilities’ of the company’s balance sheet
under the head ‘Reserves and Surpluses’.




The premium on issue of shares is not to be treated as revenue profits. In fact it is considered as capital receipt. As per
the Companies Act, 2013, when a company issues shares at a premium, whether for cash or otherwise, a sum equal to
the aggregate amount of the premium collected on shares must be credited to a separate account called “Securities
Premium Account”. There are no restrictions in the Companies Act on the issue of shares at a premium, but there are certain
restrictions at the time of its disposal. “Securities Premium Account” can be used only for the following five purposes:
   (a)   towards the issue of unissued shares of the company to the members of the company as fully paid
         bonus shares;
                                                                                           Disclosure
   (b)   in writing off the preliminary expenses of the company;
                                                                                  The      Securities  Premium
   (c)   in writing off the expenses of, or the commission paid or discount
                                                                                  Account must be shown as
         allowed on, any issue of shares or debentures of the company;
                                                                                  “Securities premium reserves”
   (d)   in providing for the premium payable on the redemption of any separately on the liabilities side
         redeemable preference shares or of any debentures of the of the balance sheet under the
         company; or                                                              head “Reserves & Surplus”.
   (e)   for the purchase of its own shares or other securities under section 68.
It is to be noted here that utilization of the amount of Securities Premium
Account except in any of the modes specified above, will attract the provisions relating to the reduction of share
capital of a company under the Section 66 of the Companies Act, 2013.

                                                                                                                      141

Note: The premium is usually payable with the installment due on allotment. However, some companies may
charge premium with share application money or partly with share application money and partly at the time of
allotment of shares. It may be included in call money also.

 C. ISSUE OF SHARES AT DISCOUNT
When the issue price of a share is less than its face value, it is said to have been issued at a discount. For
example, if a company issues shares of Rs. 10 each at Rs. 9 each, the shares are said to be issued at a discount.
The amount of discount would be to Rs. 1 per share (i.e. Rs. 10 – Rs. 9) in this case. Discount on shares is a loss
to the company.
Prohibition on the issue of Shares on Discount:
As per Section 53 of Companies Act, 2013, a company shall not issue shares at a discount except as provided
in the following cases:
   a.   Issue of Sweat Equity Share
   b.   Shares may be issued at a discount to creditors when its debt is converted into shares in pursuance
        of any statutory resolution plan or debt restructuring scheme in accordance with any guidelines or
        directions or regulations specified by the Reserve Bank of India.
Issue of shares by a company at a discounted price shall be void.
Further Section 53(3) of Companies Act, 2013 mentions of the penalty provisions which reads as: Where any
company fails to comply with the provisions of this section, such company and every officer who is in default
shall be liable to a penalty which may extend to an amount equal to the amount raised through the issue of
shares at a discount or five lakh rupees, whichever is less, and the company shall also be liable to refund all
monies received with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of issue of such shares to the persons
to whom such shares have been issued.

 SUBSCRIPTION
Minimum Subscription– It is the minimum amount which has been mentioned in the prospectus that must be
subscribed by the public before an allotment of any security can be made. Any company does not receive
application equal to the number of shares offered for subscription and there may be either of the following two
situations:




                                                                                                               143

                        Under Subscription                                       Over Subscription

 The issue is said to have been under subscribed when the company      In case a company receives
 receives applications for less number of shares than offered to the   applications for more number of shares
 public for subscription. In this case company does not face any       than the number of shares offered
 problem regarding allotment since every applicant will be allotted    to the public for subscription, it is a
 the shares applied for, and the company can proceed with allotment    case of over subscription. A company
 provided the minimum subscription for shares is met.                  cannot allot more shares than what it
                                                                       has offered.

In case of over subscription company has the following options:

Option I
   (i)   Rejection of Excess Applications and Money Returned
		 The company may reject the applications for shares which are received in excess of the shares offered
   and a letter of rejection is sent to such applicants. In this case the application money received from
   these applicants is refunded to them in full.
		 The journal entry is as follows:
                                               Journal Entry
		 Share Application A/c				                             Dr.		            (with Excess application money)
		              To Bank A/c
		 (Application money on … shares refunded to the applicants)
  (ii)   Excess application money adjusted towards sums due on allotment
                                                    Journal Entry
		 Share Application A/c				                             Dr.      (with Excess application money)
			             To Share Allotment A/c
		 (Excess application money adjusted towards sums due on allotment)
		 If the application money received on partially accepted applications is more than the amount required
   for adjustment towards allotment money, the excess money is refunded. However, if the Articles of the
   company so authorise, the directors may retain the excess money as calls in advance to be adjusted
   against the call/calls falling due at a later date. The consent of the applicant has to be taken either by
   a separate letter or by inserting a clause in the company’s prospectus.
		 The company can retain the calls in advance at maximum to the amount as is sufficient to make the
   allotted shares fully paid up ultimately. The following entry is made:
		                                                  Journal Entry
		 Share Application A/c		 Dr. (with Excess application money left over the amount due on
   					application and allotment)
			             To Call-in-advance A/c
		 (The adjustment of excess share application money retained as call-in advance in respect of ... shares)

Option II
Partial acceptance of Applications (Pro-rata acceptance):
In some cases, the company accepts the applications for subscription partially. It means that the company does
not allot the full number of shares that are applied for. The shares are accepted in a ratio, as determined, this
is known as pro-rata acceptance.
  For example, if an applicant has applied for 5000 shares and is allotted only 2000 shares, then his
  application is said to has been partially accepted. The company may evolve some formula of accepting
  applications partially or making proportionate allotment/ the Pro-rata allotment means that the applicants
  are allotted shares proportionately such that no applicant is refused of shares and no applicant allotted
  shares in full.
In such a case, the company adjusts the excess share money received on application towards share allotment
money due on partially accepted applications.
The journal entry recording the adjustment of application money towards share allotment money, is as under:
                                                     Journal Entry

           To Share Allotment Account
(Share application money transferred to Share Allotment Account in respect of ... shares)

 CALLS-IN-ADVANCE
Sometimes shareholders pay a part or the whole of the amount of the calls not yet made. The amount so
received from the shareholders is known as “Calls in Advance”. The amount received in advance is a liability
of the company and should be credited to ‘Call in Advance Account.” The amount received will be adjusted
towards the payment of calls as and when they becomes due. Table F of the Companies Act provides for the
payment of interest on calls in advance at a rate not exceeding 12% per annum.
It is to be noted that no dividend can be paid on calls-in-advance.

Disclosure Treatment: The money received on calls-in-advance does not become part of the share capital. It is
shown under a separate heading, namely ‘calls-in-advance’ on the liabilities side of the Balance Sheet. Further,
the liability to sundry shareholders is to be treated as outstanding liability and should be shown under the head
“Current Liabilities” in the balance sheet.

 CALLS-IN-ARREAR
It may happen that shareholders do not pay the call amount on due date. When any shareholder fails to pay
the amount due on allotment or on any of the calls, such amount is known as ‘Calls in Arrears’/‘Unpaid Calls’.
Interest on Calls-in-Arrear The interest is recoverable according to the provisions in this regard in Articles
of the company. But if the Articles are silent, Table ‘F’ of Schedule I of the Companies Act, 2013, shall be
applicable which prescribes that if a sum called in respect of shares is not paid before or on the day appointed
for payment, the person who failed to pay shall pay thereof from the day appointed for payment to the time
of actual payment at a rate not exceeding 10% per annum. However, the Directors have the right to waive the
payment of interest on Calls-in- Arrear. The interest on Calls-on-Arrear Account is transferred to the Profit and
Loss Account at the end of the year.

 ISSUE OF SHARES FOR CONSIDERATION OTHER THAN CASH
There are instances where a company enters into an arrangement with the vendors from whom it has purchased
assets, whereby the latter agrees to accept, the payment in the form of fully paid shares of the company issued
to them. Normally, no such cash is received for issue of shares. These shares can also be issued either at par, at
premium or at discount, and the number of shares to be issued will depend upon the price at which the shares
are issued and the amount payable to the vendor.
Case 1: In some cases, shares are issued to the promoters of the company in lieu of the services provided by
them during the incorporation of the company. This would generate good will.

 FORFEITURE OF SHARES
Meaning: In case where a shareholder fails to pay the allotment money and/or calls made on him, his shares
are liable to be forfeited. Forfeiture of shares may be said to be the compulsory termination of his membership
by way of penalty for non-payment of allotment and/or any call money. Articles of Association of the Company
provide the authority to forfeit shares to the Board of Directors.

  Illustration: S.K. Ltd. issued 100000 shares of Rs. 10 each payable as Rs. 2 on application, Rs. 2 on
  allotment, Rs. 3 on first call and Rs. 3 on second and final call. Mr. Harish, the allottee of 100 shares,
  fails to pay the second and final call money made by the company. In this case if the Board of Directors
  decides to forfeit his shares, his membership will be cancelled and the amount of Rs 700 paid by him (on
  100 shares Rs. 2 on application, Rs. 2 on allotment and Rs.3 on first call per share) will be forfeited. Now
  Mr. Harish will no longer be the member of the company and the issued capital of the company will be
  reduced by Rs. 1000.

 Disclosure: Forfeited shares account is to be shown in the balance sheet by way of addition to the paid-
 up share capital on the ‘liabilities’ side, until the concerned shares are reissued.

 Accounting Treatment for Forfeiture of Share




A. Forfeiture of Shares issued at par
The forfeiture of shares can be recorded in following two ways:
    1.   Where the unpaid calls have already been transferred to Calls-in Arrear A/c and the respective call
         accounts have been closed:
		 Share Capital A/c Dr.                          (with the amount of called up value of shares forfeited i.e.
   			                                            no. of shares forfeited x the called up value per share.)
			 To Shares Forfeited A/c		                     (with the amount already paid-up by the shareholders on
   			                                            the shares forfeited.)
			         To Calls-in-Arrear A/c		              (with the amount of unpaid calls.) OR



                                                                                                          149

   2.   Where the unpaid calls have not been transferred to Calls-in-Arrear A/c and the respective call accounts
        are showing balances representing unpaid amounts:
		 Share Capital A/c Dr.                             (with the amount of called up value of shares forfeited i.e.,
   			                                               no. of shares forfeited x the called up value per share.)
			 To Shares Forfeited A/c		                        (with the amount already paid up by the shareholders on
   			                                               the shares forfeited.)
			         To Share Allotment A/c		                 (with the amount failed on allotment, if any.)
			         To Share First Call A/c		                (with the amount failed on first call, if any.)
			         To Share Final Call A/c		                (with the amount failed on final call, if any.)

B. Forfeiture of Shares Issued at Premium
Case 1: Where shares to be forfeited were issued at a premium and the premium money remained unpaid: In
such a case, the credit already given to the ‘Securities Premium A/c’ will be cancelled at the time of forfeiture of
the shares by debiting the “Securities Premium A/c”.

 REISSUE OF FORFEITED SHARES
The board of directors can either cancel or re-issue the forefeited shares. In most cases, they reissue such shares
which may be at par, at premium or at a discount. Forfeited shares may be reissued as fully paid at a par, premium,
discount. In this context, it may be noted that the amount of discount allowed cannot exceed the amount that had
been received on forfeited shares at the time of initial issue, and that the discount allowed on reissue of forfeited
shares should be debited to the ‘Forfeited Share Account’. The balance, if any, left in the Share-Forfeited Account
relating to reissued Shares, should be treated as capital profit and transferred to Capital Reserve Account.

RE-ISSUE OF FORFEITED SHARES - AT PAR: In one of the cases, forfeited shares can be re-issued at par. In
such a case, the entire amount standing to the credit of Shares Forfeited Account for those shares would be
treated as net gain and transferred to Capital Reserve Account.

Note: There may arise a situation when only part of shares forfeited be re-issued. In such a case, only the
respective proportionate amount which represents the net gain on shares that are re-issued shall be transferred
to the Capital Reserve Account and the remaining amount (balance) which represents the amount that is
received on the forfeited shares, not yet re-issued, must be left in Shares Forfeited Account itself.
Disclosure: This amount is disclosed as addition to the paid up share capital on liabilities side of the balance sheet.

Forfeiture and Re-issue of Shares Allotted on Pro-rata Basis in Case of Over-subscription

 BUY-BACK OF SHARES
Buy-Back of Shares means the purchase of its own shares by the Company. It is kind of a corporate financial
strategy and is an imperative mode of capital restructuring. It is a practice which is prevalent globally with the
underlying objectives of increasing Earnings per Share, averting hostile takeovers, improving returns to the
stakeholders and realigning the capital structure.

Buy-Back is an alternative way of Reduction of Share Capital. When a company has substantial cash resources,
it may like to buy its own shares from the market particularly when the prevailing rate of its shares in the
market is much lower than the book value or what the company perceives to be its true value. Buy back of
shares enables the company to go back to its shareholders and off to purchase from them the shares that they
hold.

Free Reserves: ‘Reserves which, as per latest audited Balance Sheet of the company are free for distribution as
dividend and shall include balance to the credit of Security Premium A/c but shall not include Share Application
Money’.

Advantages of Buy Back:

       I.   To improve the earnings per share;

      II.   To improve return on capital, return on net worth and to enhance the long-term value for shareholders;

   III.     To provide an additional exit route to shareholders when shares are undervalued or thinly traded;

   IV.      It is an alternative mode of reduction in capital without requiring approval of the Court/CLB (NCLT),

   V.       To enhance consolidation of stake in the company;

   VI.      To prevent unwelcome takeover bids;

  VII.      To return surplus cash to shareholders;

 VIII.      To achieve optimum capital structure;

   IX.      To support share price during periods of sluggish market conditions;

   X.       To serve the equity more efficiently.

Example: Improvement in EPS can be explained by below example:

                                 Particulars          Pre Buy – Back        Post Buy – Back

                        Profit                             100                     100

  Compute the maximum limit up to Which buy-back is permitted in the financial year 2023-2024.
  Solution:
   (1)   The buy-back of equity shares in any financial year should not exceed 25% of its total paid-up equity
         capital in that financial year .[RS.30,000*25%= RS.7,500]
   (2)   25% of the aggregate of paid-up capital and free reserves of the company .
		 [(30,000+3,000+10,000) *25%=RS.10,750]
   (3)   The ratio of the aggregate of secured and unsecured debts owed by the company after buy-back is
         not more than twice the paid-up capital and its free reserves
         let the amount of buy-back be 		            ‘x‘
		secured + Unsecured debts                		        <2
		 paid-up capital +free reserves
		 let the amount to be buy-back be                  ‘x’

                        62.000
                                                =2
              30,000 - x +(3000+10000-x)

                        62.000
                                                =2
                      43000 -2x
		 62000 = 86000 -4x
		 -24000 = - 4x
		 x = 6,000
  since out of the above three calculations , minimum amount is 6,000; Hence maximum face value of
  shares that can be bought is RS. 6000 lakhs i.e 600 lakh shares. (6000/10=600)

  Case 3: If the redeemable preference shares are redeemed partly out of the profits of the company which
  would otherwise be available for dividend and partly out of the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares made
  for the purpose of redemption:



                                                                                                         179

  In such a case, the Capital Redemption Reserve Account and the new Share Capital Account taken
  together will replace the Redeemable Preference Share Capital redeemed.
  Thus, Redeemable Preference Share Capital redeemed = Capital Redemption Reserve Account + New
  Share Capital Account (Equity or Preference).
  Here, all the entries shown under Case (i) and Case (ii) have to be passed. But there are certain common
  entries which can be combined together.

                                             LESSON ROUND-UP

  l Share represents a singular unit into which the total share capital of a company is divided.

  l Share capital includes majorly the following two types of shares under the Companies Act, 2013:

         (a)    Preference Shares and (b) Equity Shares.

  l An equity share is the one which is not a preference share. Equity shares are also known for their risk-
      bearing. Preference shares are the shares that hold preferential rights as to the payment of dividend at
      a fixed rate; and the return of capital on winding up of the company.
  l Shares may be issued for cash or for a consideration other than cash. When a company allots fully paid
      shares to promoters or to creditors or to any other party for the services rendered by them, it is known
      as issue of shares for consideration other than cash.
  l Shares of a company may be issued at :

           a.   Par – When shares are issued on a price equivalent to its face value.

           b.   Premium – When shares are issued at a price higher than the face value.

           c.   Discount – When shares are issued at a price lower than the face value.

  l Restrictions on the usage of the Securities premium money received has been laid under section 52(2)
      of Companies Act 2013.
  l When the number of shares applied for exceeds the number of shares issued, the shares are said to be
      oversubscribed. In such a case, some applications may be rejected; some applications are accepted in
      full; and allotment is made to the remaining applicants on pro-rata basis.

   l Forfeiture of shares is considered as the compulsory termination of membership by way of penalty for
       non-payment of allotment and/or any call money.
   l The forfeited shares may be reissued at:
           a.   Par
           b.   Premium
           c.   Discount
   l In case of reissue of forfeited shares at a premium, the entire amount standing to the credit of Shares
       Forfeited Account would be treated as net gain and transferred to Capital Reserve Account.
   l In case the forfeited shares are reissued at a discount, the amount of discount can, in no case, exceed
       the amount credited to Shares Forfeited Account.
   l As per Section 68, 69, 70 of the Companies Act, 2013, a company may purchase its own shares or other
       specified securities out of its free reserves and this is known as buy-back.
   l A company is under a legal obligation to first offer the subsequent issue of shares to its existing equity
       shareholders. This right is called rights issue.
   l Company may issue fully paid up bonus shares to its members, in any manner out of (i) its free reserves;
       (ii) the securities premium account; or (iii) the capital redemption reserve account.
   l Sweat equity shares refers to equity shares given to the company’s employees/ directors on favourable
       terms in recognition of their work at a discount or consideration other than cash
   l Underwriting is known as a guarantee given by the underwriters to the company that the shares or
       debentures offered to the public will be subscribed for in full. An underwriting agreement may be:
           a.   Complete Underwriting
           b.   Partial Underwriting. Firm Underwriting.

 DEBENTURES
The word ‘debenture’ has been derived from a Latin word ‘debere’ which means to borrow. Debenture is a
written instrument acknowledging a debt under the common seal of the company. It contains a contract for
repayment of principal after a specified period or at intervals or at the option of the company and for payment
of interest at a fixed rate payable usually either half-yearly or yearly on fixed dates. Debentures are part of loan
capital and the company is liable to pay interest thereon whether it earns profit or not.

 According to section 2(30) of The Companies Act, 2013 ‘Debenture’ includes Debenture Inventory, Bonds
 and any other securities of a company whether constituting a charge on the assets of the company or not.

 ISSUE OF DEBENTURES
The procedure for the issue of debentures is the same as that for the issue of shares. The intending investors
apply for debentures on the basis of the prospectus issued by the company. The company may either ask
for the entire amount to be paid on application or by means of instalments on application, on allotment and
on various calls. Debentures can be issued at par, at a premium or at a discount. They can also be issued for
consideration other than cash or as a collateral security.

 Issue of Debentures at Discount
If the debentures are issued at a price lower than the nominal value of the debentures, the debentures are said
to be issued at a discount. The difference between the nominal value and the issue price is regarded as the
discount. Such a discount on the issue of debentures may either be written off against revenue profit or capital
profits of the company.
When debentures are issued at a discount, the Debentures Account should be credited with the nominal value
of the debentures and the discount allowed on issue of debentures. It being a capital loss should be debited to
“Discount on Issue of Debentures Account”.

 Over Subscription
When the number of debentures applied for is more than the number of debentures offered to the public, the
issue is said to be over subscribed. A company, however, cannot allot more debentures than it has invited
for subscription. The excess money received on over subscription may, however, be retained for adjustment
towards allotment and the respective calls to be made. But the money received from applicants to whom no
debentures have been allotted, will be refunded to them.

  allotment. The public applied for 14,000 debentures. Applications for 9,000 debentures were accepted
  in full; applications for 2,000 debentures were allotted 1,000 debentures and the remaining applications,
  were rejected. All money was duly received. Journalise the transactions.

 Issue of Debentures for Consideration other than Cash
Sometimes a company may allot debentures (on a par, premium or discount) to vendors as a payment for the
purchase price of the assets. The issue of debentures is then for consideration other than cash. In such a case,
the following journal entries are made:

 DEBENTURES ISSUED AS A COLLATERAL SECURITY
A collateral security may be defined as a subsidiary or secondary or additional security besides the primary
security when a company obtains a loan or overdraft from a bank or any other financial Institution. It may
pledge or mortgage some assets as a secured loan against the said loan. But the lending institutions may insist
on additional assets as collateral security so that the amount of loan can be realised in full with the help of
collateral security in case the amount from the sale of principal security falls short of the loan money. In such
situation, the company may issue its own debentures to the lenders in addition to some other assets already
pledged. Such an issue of debentures is known as ‘Debentures issued as Collateral Security’.
If the company fails to repay the loan along with interest, the lender is free to receive his money from the sale
of primary security and if the realisable value of the primary security falls short to cover the entire amount, the
lender has the right to invoke the benefit of collateral security whereby debentures may either be presented for
redemption or sold in the open market.

Accounting Treatment
Debentures issued as collateral security can be dealt within two ways in the books of the company:

                                                 FIRST METHOD

 No accounting entry is required to be shown in the books of account at the time of issue of such debentures
 because there is no immediate liability created by the company. But the existence of such debentures issued as
 collateral security has to be mentioned by way of a note on the Balance Sheet under the specific loan account.

                                                SECOND METHOD

 If it is desired that such an issue of debentures as collateral security is to be recorded in the books of account,
 the accounting entries will be as follows:
  (i) On issue of debentures as collateral security
 		 Debentures Suspense A/c                    Dr.      (with the nominal value of the debentures issued)
 			      To Debentures A/c
 		 In this case, Debentures Suspense Account will appear on the asset side of the balance sheet under the
    heading Miscellaneous Expenditure. Debentures Account will appear as a liability on the liabilities side
    of the Balance Sheet.
  (ii) On repayment of the loan and release of debentures
 		 Debentures A/c                             Dr.      (with the nominal value of the debentures released)
 			      To Debentures Suspense A/c
 Note: The net effect of the above two entries is nil. Both the Debentures Suspense Account and the Debentures
 Account are cancelled on repayment of the loan. As such, this method is rarely followed in practice.

                                                                                                                 197

 DEBENTURE INTEREST
When a company issues debentures, it is under an obligation to pay interest thereon at fixed percentage (half
yearly) periodically until debentures are repaid. This percentage is usually as part of the name of debentures
like 8% debentures, 10% debentures, etc., and interest payable is calculated at the nominal value of debentures.
Interest on debenture is a charge against the profit of the company and must be paid whether the company has
earned any profit or not.
According to Income Tax Act, 1961, a company must deduct income tax at a prescribed rate from the interest payable
on debentures if it exceeds the prescribed limit. It is called Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) and is to be deposited with
the tax authorities. Of course, the debenture holders can adjust this amount against the tax due from them.

 Terms of Issue of Debentures
When a company issues debentures, it usually mentions the terms on which they will be redeemed on their
maturity. Redemption of debentures means discharge of liability on account of debentures by repayment made
to the debenture holders. Debentures can be redeemed either at par or at a premium. Depending upon the
terms and conditions of issue and redemption of debentures, the following six situations are commonly found
in practice.




In all the above six cases, the following journal entries will be passed:
   (i)    Issued at par and redeemable at par:
		 Bank Account                                          Dr.    (with the nominal value of debentures)

Note:
      1.   When debentures are redeemable at a premium, the premium payable on redemption is debited to
           ‘Loss on Issue of Debentures A/c’. It may be noted that when debentures are issued at a discount and
           are redeemable at a premium, the amount of discount on issue is also debited to ‘Loss on Issue of
           Debentures’. It may be noted that when the debentures are issued at a discount and are redeemable at
           par, the amount debited to ‘Discount on Issue of Debentures A/c’ as usual.
   2.      Premium on redemption is a liability of a company payable in future. It is a provision and is shown
           under the head Non-current liabilities under subhead ‘Long-term Borrowings’ until debentures are
           redeemed.

 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF DISCOUNT/LOSS ON THE ISSUE OF DEBENTURES
The discount/loss on debentures is in the nature of capital loss and therefore the same must be written off over
the life time of debentures. The entire amount of discount or loss on issue of debenture cannot be written off
in the year of issue since the benefit of debenture capital will continue till the redemption of debentures takes
place. However, the following alternatives are available to write off discount/loss on issue of debentures.
      1.   Discount on issue of debentures being a capital loss can be written off against capital profits.
   2.      Discount on issue of debentures can be treated as deferred revenue expenditure and written off against
           revenue over the period of life of the debentures.
The following are the two methods which are generally adopted for this purpose.




  Illustration 11
  Bee Ltd. issued 2,000, 12% Debentures of Rs.100 each at a discount of 6% on 01.04.2018 repayable by
  equal annual drawings in four years. You are required to show the discount on Issue of Debentures
  Account over the period.
  Solution:
  Total amount of discount on issue of debentures:
  = Rs. 2,00,000 x 6/100 = Rs. 12,000
  This total discount of Rs. 12,000 has to be written off in proportion to the debentures outstanding at the
  beginning of each year. Thus, outstanding balance ratio will be as follows:
  1.4.2018 = Rs. 2,00,000
  1.4.2019 = Rs. (2,00,000 - 50,000) = Rs.1,50,000
  1.4.2020= Rs. (1,50,000 - 50,000) = Rs. 1,00,000
  1.4.2021 = Rs. (1,00,000 - 50,000) = Rs.50,000
  Outstanding balance ratio = 2,00,000 : 1,50,000 : 1,00,000 : 50,000
  =4:3:2:1
  Therefore, amount of discount to be written off every year will be as follows:
                                                 Rs.
  31.3.2019 = 12,000 x 4/10 =                 4,800
  31.3.2020 = 12,000 x 3/10 =                 3,600

  31.3.2021 = 12,000 x 2/10 =              2,400
  31.3.2022 = 12,000 x 1/10 =              1,200

 by a special resolution passed at a duly
 convened general meeting.

 CREATION OF DEBENTURE REDEMPTION RESERVE
Section 71(4) of the Companies Act, 2013, read with Rule 18(7) of the Companies (Share Capital And Debentures)
Rules, 2014, requires every company issuing redeemable non-convertible debentures to create a Debenture
Redemption Reserve (DRR) account of at least a certain percentage of the total outstanding value of the issued
debentures (described below), out of the profits of the company available for the payment of dividend and the
amount credited to such account shall only be used for the redemption of debentures. This effort is to protect
the debenture holders from the possibility of the company defaulting on repayments, as DRR ensures that
enough funds are available to meet the obligations of the debenture holders.
Let us assume that an unlisted company issues `10 crore worth of debentures in January 2022 with a maturity
date of January 2032. In this case, the company has to create `1 crore (representing 10% of the total outstanding
of the issued debentures, i.e., `10 crore) as DRR before the maturity date.

 Adequacy of Debenture Redemption Reserve (DRR)
The Debenture Redemption Reserve shall be created out of the profits of the company available for payment
of dividend; the limits with respect to adequacy of DRR and investment or deposits, as the case may be, shall
be as under:

  Sr.                           Debentures issued by                              Adequacy of Debenture

Important Point:

    l   The amount deposited or invested, as the case may be, above should not be utilised for any purpose
        other than for the redemption of debentures maturing during the year referred to above.

		 Provided that the amount remaining deposited or invested, as the case may be, shall not at any time
   fall below 15% of the amount of debentures maturing during the 31st day of March of that year.

    l   In case of partly convertible debentures, DRR shall be created in respect of non-convertible portion of
        debenture issue.

    l   The amount credited to DRR shall not be utilised by the company except for the purpose of redemption
        of debentures.

    l   It should be noted that appropriation to DRR can be made any time before redemption and Investments
        in specified securities as mentioned above can be done before 30th April for the debentures maturing
        that year, however, for the sake of simplicity and ease, it is advisable to make the appropriation and
        investment immediately after the debentures are allotted assuming that the company has sufficient
        amount of profits (issued if allotment date is not given in the question). Also, in some cases, the date of
        allotment could be missing, in such cases the appropriation and investments should be done on the first
        day of that year for which ledgers accounts are to be drafted.

                                               LESSON ROUND-UP

   l Debentures are Part of loan capital and the company is liable to pay interest thereon whether it earns
       profit or not

   l Debentures may be of different kinds depending upon the conditions of their issue- secured , unsecured,
       bearer, registered, convertible, non- convertible, redeemable, irredeemable, first mortgage, second
       mortgage.

   l Debentures may be issued at par, or at a premium, or at a discount

   l Debentures can be issued for cash, consideration other than cash and as collateral security.

   l The term ‘Collateral Security may be defined as additional security given for a loan. Where a company
       obtains a secured loan from a bank or insurance company, it may mortgage some of its assets as a
       security against the said loan.

   l Wherever a company issues debentures it undertakes to pay interest thereon at a fixed percentage. As
       the debentures acknowledge a debt, the payment of interest on the debt is obligatory on the part of the
       company issuing them irrespective of the fact whether the company earns profit or not. Thus, interest
       payable on debentures is a charge against the profits of the company.

   l The discount/loss on debentures is in the nature of capital loss and therefore the same must be written
       off over the life time of debentures.

   l When debentures are redeemed out of capital, no debenture redemption reserve is created out of
       profit of the company.

   l Section 71(4) of the companies Act, 2013 provides that the debentures shall be redeemed out of divisible
       profits of the company through the creation of Debenture Redemption Reserve.

   l A company if authorized by its articles of association, can buy its own debentures in the open market.
       The debentures so purchased can be used either for immediate cancellation or redemption of
       debentures or for investment.

   l If the purchase price for the debentures includes interest for the expired period, the quotation is said to
       be “Cum-interest”. If, on the other hand, the purchase price for the debentures excludes the interest for
       the expired period, the quotation is said to be “Ex-interest”.

 EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN (ESOP)
ESOP means a scheme under which the company grants option (a right but not an obligation) to an employee
to apply for shares of the company at a predetermined price. This right is exercisable by the employee, during
the specified period.
Section 2(37) of the Companies Act, 2013 states that the “employee stock option” means the option given to
the whole time director, officers or employees of a company which gives such directors, officers or employees
the benefit or right to purchase or subscribe at a future date, the securities offered by the company at a
predetermined price. The SEBI has issued guidelines for ESOS of listed companies. These guidelines are also
applicable for Employee Stock Purchase Scheme (ESPS), which implies a scheme under which the company
offers shares to employee as part of public issue or otherwise.

A company issuing the options has to fulfill following prescribed conditions:

   (a)   these shares are of the same class of shares already issued;

   (b)   it is authorised by a special resolution passed by the company;

   (c)   the resolution specifies the number of shares, the current market price, consideration, if any, and the
         class or classes of directors or employees to whom such equity shares are to be issued;

   (d)   not less than one year has, at the date of issue, elapsed since the date on which the company had
         commenced business; and

   (e)   these shares are issued in accordance with SEBI regulations, if the shares are listed.

 Accounting for ESOP
For accounting purposes, employee share-based payment plans are classified into the following
categories:




An enterprise should measure the fair value of shares or stock options granted at the grant date, based on
market prices, if available, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which those shares or stock options
were granted. If market prices are not available, the enterprise should estimate the fair value of the instruments
granted using a valuation technique to estimate what the price of those instruments would have been on the
grant date in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. The valuation technique
should be consistent with generally accepted valuation methodologies for pricing financial instruments (e.g.,
use of an option pricing model for valuing stock options) and should incorporate all factors and assumptions
that knowledgeable, willing market participants would consider in setting the price. Vesting conditions, other
than market conditions, should not be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares or stock
options at the grant date. Instead, vesting conditions should be taken into account by adjusting the number of
shares or stock options included in the measurement of the transaction amount so that, ultimately, the amount
recognized for employee services received as consideration for the shares or stock options granted is based on
the number of shares or stock options that eventually vest.

Hence, on a cumulative basis, no amount is recognized for employee services received if the shares or stock
options granted do not vest because of failure to satisfy a vesting condition (i.e., these are forfeited), e.g., the
employee fails to complete a specified service period, or a performance condition is not satisfied.




                                                                                                                223
EP-CA&FM                                                                            Related Aspects of Company Accounts

 Equity-settled Employee Share-based Payment Plans
An enterprise should recognize as an expense (except where service received qualifies to be included as a
part of the cost of an asset) the services received in an equity-settled employee share-based payment plan
when it receives the services, with a corresponding credit to an appropriate equity account, say, ‘Stock Options
Outstanding Account’. This account is transitional in nature as it gets ultimately transferred to another equity
account such as share capital, securities premium account and/or general reserve as recommended in the
Guidance Note.

If the shares or stock options granted vest immediately, the employee is not required to complete a specified
period of service before becoming unconditionally entitled to those instruments. In the absence of evidence
to the contrary, the enterprise should presume that services rendered by the employee as consideration for
the instruments have been received. In this case, on the grant date, the enterprise should recognize services
received in full with a corresponding credit to the equity account.

If the shares or stock options granted do not vest until the employee completes a specified period of service,
the enterprise should presume that the services to be rendered by the employee as consideration for those
instruments will be received in the future, during the vesting period. The enterprise should account for those
services as they are rendered by the employee during the vesting period, on a time proportion basis, with a
corresponding credit to the equity account.

To apply the requirements of the Guidance Note on Employee Share Based Payments, the enterprise should
recognize an amount for the employee services received during the vesting period based on the best available
estimate of the number of shares or stock options expected to vest and should revise that estimate, if necessary,
if subsequent information indicates that the number of shares or stock options expected to vest differs from
previous estimates. On vesting date, the enterprise should revise the estimate to equal the number of shares
or stock options that ultimately vest. Market conditions, such as a target share price upon which vesting (or
right to exercise) is conditioned, should be taken into account when estimating the fair value of the shares
or stock options granted. On exercise of the right to obtain shares or stock options, the enterprise issues
shares on receipt of the exercise price. The shares so issued should be considered to have been issued at the
consideration comprising the exercise price and the corresponding amount standing to the credit of the relevant
equity account (e.g., Stock Options Outstanding Account). In a situation where the right to obtain shares or
stock option expires unexercised, the balance standing to the credit of the relevant equity account should be
transferred to general reserve.

 Cash-settled Employee Share-based Payment Plans
For cash-settled employee share-based payment plans, the enterprise should measure the services received
and the liability incurred at the fair value of the liability. Until the liability is settled, the enterprise is required to
re-measure the fair value of the liability at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with any changes
in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the period.

 Employee Share-based Payment Plans with Cash Alternatives
For employee share-based payment plans in which the terms of the arrangement provide either the enterprise
or the employee with a choice of whether the enterprise settles the transaction in cash or by issuing shares, the
enterprise is required to account for that transaction, or the components of that transaction, as a cash-settled
sharebased payment plan if, and to the extent that, the enterprise has incurred a liability to settle in cash (or
other assets), or as an equity-settled share-based payment plan if, and to the extent that, no such liability has
been incurred.

Accounting for employee share-based payment plans is based on the fair value method. There is another
method known as the ‘Intrinsic Value Method’ for valuation of employee share-based payment plans. Intrinsic
value, in the case of a listed company, is the amount by which the quoted market price of the underlying share
exceeds the exercise price of an option. In the case of a non-listed company, since the shares are not quoted
on a stock exchange, value of its shares is determined on the basis of a valuation report from an independent
valuer.

 Accounting for Buy-Back
Buy-back of shares is just the opposite of issue of shares. Just as shares may be issued at par, at a premium,
even buy-back may be at par, at a premium or at a discount. The basis of accounting for buy-back is Section 68
of the Companies Act, 2013. This Section not only permits a company to buy-back or redeem its equity shares,
but also specifies the sources from out of which repurchase is to be effected.

  According to Section 68(1), a company may buy-back its shares or other specified securities from out of:
    1.    Its free reserves, or
   2.     The securities premium account, or
   3.     The proceeds of any shares or other specified securities.

However, no buy-back of shares shall be made out of the proceeds of an earlier issue of the same kind of shares
or same kind of other specified securities. This Section also lays down that all the shares or other specified
securities for buy-back are fully paid up.

                                                                                                                 235

As per Section 69, when a company purchases its own shares out of free reserves. Then a sum equal to the
nominal value of the shares so purchased shall be transferred to the Capital Redemption Reserve Account and
details of such transfer should be disclosed in the balance sheet.

company to be issued to members of the company as fully paid bonus shares.

 UNDERWRITING OF SHARES / DEBENTURES
Underwriting is an agreement, with or without conditions, to subscribe to the securities of a body corporate
when existing shareholders of the corporate or the public do not subscribe to the securities offered to them.
When a company goes in for an Initial Public Offer (IPO), it may face certain uncertainty about whether its Offer
of shares or other securities will be subscribed in full or not. If the public issue does not get fully subscribed,
the project for which the funds are being raised cannot be implemented. As per law, it is required that if the
company is not able to collect 90% of the offer amount, then it needs to compulsorily return the money to those
who have subscribed to the shares.

To avoid the risk of under subscription companies may seek the help of a specialized group of risk redeemers
called underwriters. The function of the underwriters is to arrange subscription of floated shares. If the whole or
a certain portion of the shares or debentures of the company are not applied for by the public, the underwriters
themselves apply or persuade others to apply for those shares or debentures. The underwriters, as risk takers,
and are entitled to get commission at prescribed rates.

It can be easily comprehended that when the floated shares are likely to be undersubscribed, the underwriters
come to the forefront. In other cases they remain in the background, acting as catalysts arranger of sale to the
investing public.

Before entering into an agreement with the company, the underwriters assess the following:

   (a)   worth of the public issue;

   (b)   market response to the issue; and

   (c)   their own ability to get the issue fully subscribed.

Depending upon the risk assessment of the issue, the underwriters decide on their amount of commission.
Owing to under subscription, if the issue is devalues, the underwriters pay up the required amount and deduct
their commission from that.

From the viewpoint of the issuer company, the following are generally observed:

   (a)   While selecting underwriters and finalizing underwriting arrangements, lead merchant bankers shall
         ensure that the underwriters do not overexpose themselves so that it may become difficult to fulfill
         underwriting commitments.

   (b)   The overall exposure of underwriter(s) belonging to the same group or management in an issue shall
         be assessed carefully by the lead merchant banker.

   (c)   The lead merchant banker shall satisfy themselves about the ability of the underwriters to discharge
         their underwriting obligations satisfactorily.

   (d)   The lead merchant banker shall:

          (i) incorporate a statement in the offer document to the effect that in the opinion of the lead merchant
              banker, the underwriters’ assets are adequate to meet their underwriting obligations;

          (ii)   Obtain underwriters’ written consent before including their names as underwriters in the final offer
                 document.

   (e)   In order to ascertain the underwriters’ worth, the lead merchant banker(s) shall undertake a minimum
         underwriting obligation of 5% of the total underwriting commitment, or Rs. 25 lacs whichever is less.


                                                                                                                 239
EP-CA&FM                                                                     Related Aspects of Company Accounts

   (g)   The outstanding underwriting commitments of a merchant banker shall not exceed 20 times its net
         worth, any point of time.

   (h)   The lead merchant banker shall ensure that the relevant details are included in the offer document
         underwriters.

It should be noted that as per the latest SEBI Guidelines underwriting is not mandatory. Under the SEBI rules,
no person other than a share broker or merchant banker can act as an underwriter unless he holds a certificate
granted by SEBI. Regarding underwriting, the following disclosures should be made in the Offer Document:

   (a)   Names and addresses of the underwriters and the amount underwritten by them.

   (b)   Declaration by the Board of Directors of the issuing company that the underwriters have sufficient
         resources to discharge their respective obligations.

Underwriting Agreement
An underwriting agreement is a contract between a group of investment bankers who form an underwriting
group or syndicate and the issuing corporation of a new securities issue. The purpose of the underwriting
agreement is to ensure that all of the players understand their responsibility in the process, thus minimizing
potential conflict. The underwriting agreement is also called an underwriting contract.

Sub-Underwriters
In order to spread the risk of under subscription, the principal underwriters may enter into subsidiary agreements
with sub-underwriters. Such agreements are made between the underwriters alone, with the company not
being a party thereto. As per agreement, the company pays commission at a prescribed rate to the principal
underwriters, who in turn, disburse commission to the sub-underwriters. Sometimes an additional commission is
paid to the principal underwriters to encourage sub-underwriting. This is known as over-riding commission. The
payment of an over-riding commission enables the company to deal with first one or two underwriters instead
of a number of them.

Underwriting Commission
It may be paid in cash or in fully paid up shares or debentures or a combination of all these. It is paid on the
issue price of the shares or debentures so underwritten. As per the provision of Section 40 of the Companies
Act, 2013, commission is payable, if the following conditions are satisfied:

   (a)   The payment of the commission is authorized by the articles;

   (b)   the commission may be paid out of proceedings of the issue or the profit of the company or both.

   (c)   The commission paid or agreed to be paid does not exceed in the case of shares, five per cent of the
         price at which the shares are issued or the amount or rate authorized by the articles, whichever is less,
         and in the case of debentures, two and a half per cent of the price at which the debentures are issued
         or the amount or rate authorized by the articles, whichever is less;

   (d)   the prospectus of the company shall disclose -

          (i) the name of the underwriters;

          (ii)   the rate and amount of the commission payable to the underwriter; and

         (iii)    the number of securities which is to be underwritten or subscribed by the underwriter absolutely
                  or conditionally.
   (e)   there shall not be paid commission to any underwriter on securities which are not offered to the public
         for subscription;
   (f)   A copy of the contract for the payment of the commission is delivered to the Registrar at the time of
         delivery of the prospectus or the statement in lieu of prospectus for registration.

 Full and Partial Underwriting
When the whole issue is underwritten by the underwriter(s) it is called full underwriting. When a part (say 75%)
of the whole issue is underwritten by the underwriter(s) it is called partial underwriting. In this case the company
is treated as having underwritten the balance of shares.

 Determination of Liability in respect of Underwriting Contract
The nature of underwriting contract determines the liability of the underwriter. The different types of underwriting
contract with their subdivisions can be shown with the help of the following diagram:




                                                                                                                241

Case 1: When the Issue is fully underwritten [without Firm Underwriting]
If the entire issue has been underwritten by one underwriter, the determination of his liability is very simple. The
total number of applications (both marked and unmarked) are deducted from the number of shares underwritten
and the resultant figure is treated as a liability of the underwriter. For example, X Ltd. issued 1,00,000 equity
shares of Rs. 10 each. The issue was fully underwritten by A. However, the company received applications for
80,000 shares which includes marked applications for 60,000 shares.
Here, A’s liability will be 1,00,000- 60,000- 20,000 = 20,000 shares. A would get full credit for the unmarked
20,000 applications.
Case 2: If the entire issue has been underwritten by a number of underwriters, certain difficulties may arise
in respect of division of unmarked applications.
The unmarked applications can be divided between the underwriters in the following two ways.
Method 1
Under this method, all unmarked applications are divided between the underwriters in the ratio of gross
liability of individual underwriter. For determining the liability of individual underwriter, the following steps are
followed:




Method 2
Under this method, all unmarked applications are divided between the underwriters in the ratio of gross liability
less marked applications. For determining the liability of individual underwriter following steps are followed:

Related Aspects of Company Accounts                                                                       LESSON 6




Case 3: If a part of the issue of shares or debentures is underwritten only by one underwriter:

In such a case, only a part of the whole issue, say 60% or 70% is underwritten only by one underwriter and so far
as the balance 40% or 30% of the issue is concerned, the company itself is said to have underwritten the same.
As such, the unmarked applications are treated as marked as far as the company is concerned.

In such a case, the gross liability of the underwriter will be that part of the issue of shares or debentures which
is underwritten, say 60% or 70% and the net liability will be determined by deducting the marked applications
(the applications sent through him) from the gross liability. Thus, the net liability will be determined as follows:

Net liability = Gross liability (say 60% or 70% of the issue) – Marked applications.

It is to be noted here that if the marked applications exceed or equal the number of shares or debentures
underwritten, the underwriter is free from his liability and cannot be called upon to take up any shares or
debentures of the company. Similarly, if all the shares or debentures are subscribed, the underwriter is free
from his liability in spite of the fact the marked applications are less than the number of shares or debentures
underwritten.

Case 4: If the part of the issue of shares or debentures is underwritten by a number of underwriters:

In such a case only a part of the whole issue, say 60% or 70% or 80% is underwritten by a number of underwriters
and so far as the balance 40% or 30% or 20% is concerned, the company itself is said to have underwritten
the same. As such, the unmarked applications are treated as marked so far as the company is concerned. In
such a case, the method of determining the net liability of the respective underwriters is similar to the method
discussed above.




                                                                                                                243

 FIRM UNDERWRITING
In the case of ‘firm underwriting’, the underwriters take up the agreed number of shares or debentures ‘firm
underwritten’ in addition to unsubscribed shares or debentures, if any. In such an instance, an underwriter is not
allowed to set off his firm underwriting against his liability otherwise determined, that he will have to subscribe
both for shares/debentures ‘underwritten firm’ and for shares which he has to take under the underwriting
contract, ignoring firm underwriting.
While computing the individual liability of the underwriters, the ‘firm underwriting’ can be dealt with in any of the
following manner in the absence of any specific instructions:
   (a)     The ‘firm underwriting’ may be adjusted against the individual liability of each underwriter separately
           or may be treated at par with marked applications.
		 When firm underwriting is treated at par with marked applications. In such a case, the statement of
   liability of underwriters will be as under:
		 Gross Liability (agreed ratio-total shares underwritten) ....................
		Less: Marked applications including firm underwriting....................
		 Balance left
		Less: Unmarked application (ratio of Gross liability) ....................
		 Net liability
		Add: Firm underwriting....................
		 Total Liability....................
   (b)     The benefit of ‘firm underwriting’ may be shared by all underwriters or firm underwriting may be treated
           at par with unmarked applications. In such case, the shares/debentures underwritten firm will be
           included in the unmarked forms. In such case, the state of liability of underwriters will appear as shown
           above except that shares/debentures underwritten firm by each underwriter will not be specifically
           adjusted against his individual liability but will be included in the total unmarked forms to be distributed
           amongst all underwriters in the ratio of their gross liability.

  Monlit Ltd., issued 50,000 equity, shares of which only 60% was underwritten by Green. Applications for
  45,000 shares were received in all out of which application for 26,000 were marked.
  Determine the liability of Green.
  Solution:
  Gross liability of Green being 60% of 50,000 shares,
  i.e., 60/100 x 50,000		            = 30,000 shares
  Less: Marked applications          = 26,000 shares
  Net liability of Green		           = 4,000 shares
  Notes:
   (1)     If the marked applications were for 30,000 shares or more, Green would have had no liability at all.
  (2)      If the applications received by the company were for all the 50,000 shares, Green would have no
           liability at all even though the marked applications were for 26,000 shares.
   (3)     If the applications received by the company were for 48,000 shares, Green’s liability would have
           been restricted to (50,000 - 48,000) = 2,000 shares, even though the marked applications were for
           26,000 shares.
  Sometimes, it may so happen that the information as to the marked applications and unmarked applications
  may not be given in the problem. In such a case, it has to be assumed that out of the total applications
  received by the company, the number of applications proportionate to that part of the issue underwritten
  have been received through the underwriters.

   Net liability of Black                                            = 1,200 debentures
  Alternatively, Black’s liability can be determined in the following way:
   Number of debentures not subscribed for by the public            = (30,000 – 28,000)
		                                                                   = 2,000 debentures
   Black’s liability     = 60% of 2,000 debentures
		                       = 60/100 x 2,000 = 1,200 debentures

  Alternatively, the liability of the respective underwriters can also be determined in the following manner:
  Shares issued                                          10,000
  Less: Applications received                            8,000
  Unsubscribed shares                                    2,000
  Apple’s liability                                      = 30% of 2,000 = 600 shares
  Mango’s liability                                      = 30% of 2,000 = 600 shares
  Orange’s liability                                     = 20% of 2,000 = 400 shares
  Total liability of Apple, Mango and Orange             = 600 + 600 + 400 = 1,600 shares.
  which represent 80% of the total issue underwritten. The balance (2,000 - 1,600) = 400 shares representing
  20% of the issue not underwritten will remain as unissued.

  Illustration 11:
  Ramona Ltd., issued 50,000 equity shares of which only 60% was underwritten by Green. Applications for
  45,000 shares were received in all out of which application for 26,000 were marked.

  Determine the liability of Green.

  Solution:

  Gross liability of Green being 60% of 50,000 shares = 30,000 shares

  Less: Marked applications Net liability of Green         = 26,000 shares

  Net liability of Green                                   =   4,000 shares

  Notes:

  (1)     Had the marked applications been were for 30,000 shares or more, Green would have had no
          liability at all.

  (2)     Had the applications received by the company been for all the 50,000 shares Green would have
          had no liability at all, even though the marked applications were for 26,000 shares.

  (3)     Had the applications received by the company been for 48,000 shares, Green’s liability would have
          had restricted to (50,000 - 48,000) = 2,000 shares, even though the marked applications were for
          26,000 shares.

  Working Assumption: In case the marked and unmarked applications is not be given in the question, then
  one can assume the number of applications received as marked applications (as proportionate to that part
  of the issue underwritten as received through the underwriters.)

  Illustration 12:
  ABC Ltd. issued 30,000, 6% debentures of Rs. 100 each. 60% of the issue was underwritten by Delton.
  Applications for 28,000 debentures were received by the company. Determine the liability of Delton.

  Solution:

  Gross liability of Delton being 60% of 30,000 debentures                             = 18,000 debentures

  Less: Marked applications (assumed 60%) i.e., 60/100 x 28,000                        = 16,800 debentures

  Net liability of Delton                                                              = 1,200 debentures

  Alternatively Delton’s liability can be determined in the following way:

  Number of debentures not subscribed for by the public = (30,000 - 28,000)            = 2,000 debentures

  Delton’s liability = 60% of 2,000 debentures                                         = 1,200 debentures

  Determine the liability of the respective underwriters.

  Alternatively the liability of the respective underwriters can also be determined in the following manner:
  Shares issued 10,000
  Less: Applications received 8,000 Unsubscribed shares 2,000
  Apple’s liability = 30% of 2,000 =                         600 shares
  Mango’s liability = 30% of 2,000 =                         600 shares
  Orange’s liability = 20% of 2,000 =                        400 shares
  Total liability of Apple, Mango and Orange =               600 + 600 + 400 = 1,600 shares.

         Board of India Employee Stock Option Scheme Guidelines shall not offer shares to its employees under
         a scheme of employees’ stock option (hereinafter referred to as “Employees Stock Option Scheme”).
  l ESOP means a scheme under which the company grants option (a right but not an obligation) to an
         employee to apply for shares of the company at a predetermined price. This right is exercisable by the
         employee, during the specified period.
  l Section 2(37) of the Companies Act, 2013 states that the “employee stock option” means the option
         given to the whole time director, officers or employees of a company which gives such directors, officers
         of employees the benefit or right to purchase or subscribe at a future date, the securities offered by the
         company at a predetermined price.
  l When a company has substantial cash resources, it may like to buy its own shares from the market
         particularly when the prevailing rate of its shares in the market is much lower than the book value or
         what the company perceives to be its true value.
  l As per Section 68, 69, 70 of the Companies Act, 2013 states that a company may purchase its own
         shares or other specified securities out of its free reserves, and the proceeds of any other shares or
         other specified securities.
  l Buy-back is permissible: (a) from the existing security holders on a proportionate basis through the
         tender offer; or (b) from the open market.
  l Regulation 10(1) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India provides that a company shall, as and by
         way of security for performance of its obligations on or before the opening of the offer of re- purchase,
         deposit in an escrow account such sum as is specified in 10(2).
  l According to Section 43 of the Companies Act, 2013, Equity share capital may be Equity Share Capital
         with the voting right or Equity Share Capital with differential right as to dividend, voting or otherwise.
  l Rule 4 of the Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules 2014 deals with equity shares with
         differential rights.
  l The company shall not convert its existing equity share capital with voting rights into equity share
         capital carrying differential voting rights and vice versa.

   l The holders of the equity shares with differential rights shall enjoy all other rights, such as bonus
          shares, rights shares etc., which the holders of equity shares are entitled to, subject to the differential
          rights with which such shares have been issued.

   l Where a company issues equity shares with differential rights, the Register of Members maintained
          under section 88 shall contain all the relevant particulars of the shares so issued along with details of
          the shareholders.

   l Underwriting is an undertaking or guarantee given by the underwriters to the company that the shares
          or debentures offered to the public will be subscribed for in full.

   l An underwriting agreement may be: Complete Underwriting, Partial Underwriting and Firm Underwriting.

   l Applications bearing the stamp of the respective underwriters are called marked applications and the
          applications received directly by the company which do not bear any stamp of the underwriters are
          known as unmarked applications.

 INTRODUCTION
It is an era of business growth. Many organizations are growing into large corporations by the process of
acquisition, mergers, gaining control by one company over the other company, restructuring etc. Acquisition
and mergers ultimately leads to either cost reduction or controlling the market or sharing the material supplies
or product diversification or availing tax benefits or synergy. Whatever the motto behind these ventures is, the
ultimate result is the large scale corporation. Formation of holding company is the most popular device for
achieving these objectives.
Group of companies: Many a times, company expands by keeping intact their separate corporate identity. In
this situation, a company (holding company) gains control over the other company (subsidiary company). This
significant control is exercised by one company over the other by –
      1.    Purchasing specified number of shares or
   2.       Exercising control over the board of directors or on voting power of that company.
Unit of companies connected in these ways is collectively called a Group of Companies. Holding Company and
Subsidiary Company have been defined in Section 2 of the Companies Act, 2013.

 Holding Company

 As per Section 2(46) of the Companies Act, 2013 “holding company”, in relation to one or more other companies,
 means a company of which such companies are subsidiary companies;


 Subsidiary Company
As per Section 2(87) of the Companies Act, 2013 “subsidiary company” or “subsidiary”, in relation to any other
company (that is to say the holding company), means a company in which the holding company–
      (i)   controls the composition of the Board of Directors; or
   (ii)     exercises or controls more than one-half of the total share capital either at its own or together with one
            or more of its subsidiary companies.
A company shall be deemed to be a subsidiary company of the holding company even if there is indirect
control through the subsidiary company (ies).
The control over the composition of a subsidiary company’s Board of Directors means exercise of some power
to appoint or remove all or a majority of the directors of the subsidiary company.
‘Total share capital’, as defined in section 2(87) (ii) above, has been further clarified by the Rule 2(1)(r) of the
Companies (Specification of Definitions Details) Rules, 2016. As per the Rule, total share capital includes
   a)       paid up equity share capital
   b)       convertible preference share capital.
Section 19 of the Companies Act, 2013 prohibits a subsidiary company from holding shares in the holding
company. According to this section, no company shall, either by itself or through its nominees, hold any shares in
its holding company and no holding company shall allot or transfer its shares to any of its subsidiary companies
and any such allotment or transfer of shares of a company to its subsidiary company shall be void.

   b)   the subsidiary company holds such shares as a trustee; or
   c)   the subsidiary company is a shareholder even before it became a subsidiary company of the holding
        company.
The subsidiary company shall have a right to vote at a meeting of the holding company only in respect of the
shares held by it as a legal representative or as a trustee,

 Company Includes Body Corporate

    l   As per Section 2(87) of the Companies Act, 2013 Company include a ‘Body Corporate’.
    l   As per Section 2(11) of the Companies Act, 2013 Body Corporate includes a ‘Company incorporate
        out of India’.

Thus, an Indian company in which more than 50% shares are held by a foreign body corporate will be a
‘Subsidiary Company’. Similarly, any Indian body corporate can be ‘holding company’ even if that body
corporate is not registered as ‘company’ under Companies Act.
An Indian company can be holding/subsidiary of a foreign body corporate even if it is not registered as a
Company.

of at least twenty per cent of total share capital, or of business decisions under an agreement. In the case of
joint ventures it is always by way an agreement significant influence is used but not necessarily by control over
share capital. The meaning of significant influence is in line with AS18.

 Wholly Owned Subsidiary Company
A company in which all the shares with voting rights (i.e. 100%) are owned by the holding company, it is said to
be a wholly owned subsidiary company.

 Partly Owned Subsidiary Company
A company in which only the majority of shares (more than 50%) are owned by the holding company, it is said
to be a party owned subsidiary.

may be prescribed.

           financial year should be attached to the balance sheet of the holding company.
      7.   If the financial year of the subsidiary company does not coincide with the financial year of the holding
           company, a statement showing the following should be attached:
            (i) Whether, and to what extent, there has been a change in the holding company’s interest in the

In a nutshell, if the financial years of both the subsidiary and holding companies do not coincide, the preceding
year’s balance sheet and other statements of the subsidiary company should be attached. The information
attached to the balance sheet of a holding company in respect of its subsidiary companies could not be more
than 6 months.

Exclusion from Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements
As per AS 21, a subsidiary should be excluded from consolidation when:
   a)   control is intended to be temporary because the subsidiary is acquired and held exclusively with a view
        to its subsequent disposal in the near future; or
   b)   it operates under severe long-term restrictions which significantly impair its ability to transfer funds to
        the parent.
In consolidated financial statements, investments in such subsidiaries should be accounted for in accordance
with AS 13 ‘Accounting for Investments’. The reasons for not consolidating a subsidiary should be disclosed in
the consolidated financial statements.

  Consolidation of its subsidiary which is a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) or a partnership firm
  As per rule 6 of Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014, under the heading ‘Manner of consolidation of accounts’
  it is provided that consolidation of financial statements of a company shall be done in accordance with the
  provisions of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and the applicable Accounting Standards.
  It is noted that relevant Indian Accounting Standard i.e., Ind AS 110, Consolidated Financial Statements
  provides that where an entity has control on one or more other entities, the controlling entity is required to
  consolidate all the controlled entities. Since, the word ‘entity’ includes a company as well as any other form
  of entity, therefore, LLPs and partnership firms are required to be consolidated. Similarly, under Accounting
  Standard (AS) 21, as per the definition of subsidiary, an enterprise controlled by the parent is required
  to be consolidated. The term ‘enterprise’ includes a company and any enterprise other than a company.
  Therefore, under AS also, LLPs and partnership firms are required to be consolidated.
  Accordingly, in the given case, holding company is required to consolidate its subsidiary which is an LLP or
  a partnership firm.
  Consolidation of Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) which is an associate or joint venture
  If LLP or a partnership firm is an associate or joint venture of holding company, even then the LLP and the
  partnership firm need to be consolidated in accordance with the requirements of applicable Accounting
  Standards.

 ADVANTAGES OF CONSOLIDATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
    1.   Facilitates easy comprehension: Shareholders are in a position to get a clear insight about the financial
         position of the group (parent and all its subsidiaries).
   2.    Assists in ascertaining intrinsic value of share: For various accounting procedures, intrinsic value
         of shares serves as an essential tool. This can be attained on the basis of consolidated financial
         statements of companies.
   3.    Proper assessment of return on investment: Only consolidated financial statements can provide
         proper information on the total share of holding company in the revenue profit of its subsidiaries.
   4.    Minority interest disclosure: In the consolidated balance sheets, the item shown under the head
         ‘Minority Interest’ discloses the total amount payable to outside shareholders. This is the liability
         payable to outsiders, i.e., general public. This factor is the main factor to be considered in the process
         of acquisition of company.
   5.    Helps in the “evaluation” of holding company: As consolidated financial statements reflect a true
         and fair view of the position of the holding company (parent) as a group, the investors may be able to
         evaluate the performance of the company. Thereby, it enhances the overall performance of the group.
The following are its limitations:
    1.   Varied information: All the subsidiary companies may not carry the same type of business. As their
         activities differ from each other, information combined together in a single format may result in confusion
         and alternatives.
   2.    Irrelevant concealment of facts: The data got from subsidiary companies may not be relevant in the
         combined form. Further, to arrive at common figures, some of the facts may be suppressed. In such a
         situation, a consolidated financial statement may not reflect a true and fair view of the position of the
         companies.

 CONSOLIDATION PROCEDURES
Rule 6 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 states that the manner of consolidation of financial statements of
the company shall be in accordance with the provisions of Schedule III of the Act and the applicable accounting
standards. AS 21, lays down the procedure for consolidation of financial statements of the companies within
the group.
When preparing consolidated financial statements, the individual balances of the parent and its subsidiaries
are aggregated on a line-by-line basis, and then certain consolidation adjustments are made.
For example, the cash, trade receivables and prepayments of the parent and each subsidiary are added together
to arrive at the cash, trade receivables and prepayments of the group, before consolidation adjustments are
made.

                                                                                                                263

The objective is that the consolidated financial statements should present the information contained in the
consolidated financial statements of a parent and its subsidiaries as if they were the financial statements of a
single economic entity.
In order that the consolidated financial statements present financial information about the group as that of a
single enterprise, the following steps are then taken:
      1.   the carrying amount of the parent’s investment in each subsidiary and the parent’s portion of equity of
           each subsidiary are eliminated. In case cost of acquisition exceeds or is less than the acquirer’s interest,
           goodwill or capital reserve is calculated retrospectively;
   2.      intragroup transactions, including sales, expenses and dividends, are eliminated, in full;
   3.      unrealised profits resulting from intragroup transactions that are included in the carrying amount of
           assets, such as inventory and fixed assets, are eliminated in full;
   4.      unrealised losses resulting from intragroup transactions that are deducted in arriving at the carrying
           amount of assets are also eliminated unless cost cannot be recovered;
   5.      minority interest in the net income of consolidated subsidiaries for the reporting period are identified
           and adjusted against the income of the group in order to arrive at the net income attributable to the
           owners of the parent; and
   6.      minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified and presented in the
           consolidated balance sheet separately from liabilities and the parent shareholders’ equity.

 CONTENTS AND FORMAT OF CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET
Section 129 (Clause 3) of the Companies Act, 2013 mandated the companies having one or more subsidiaries,
to prepare Consolidated Financial Statements. According to this section, where a company has one or more
subsidiaries, it shall, in addition to separate financial statements will prepare a consolidated financial statement
of the company and of all the subsidiaries in the same form and manner as that of its own.
It shall also attach along with its financial statements, a separate statement containing the salient features of
the financial statement of its subsidiary or subsidiaries in the prescribed form.
Consolidated Financial Statements are intended to show the financial position of the group as a whole - by
showing the economic resources controlled by them, by presenting the obligations of the group and the results
the group achieves with its resources.
The Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013, provides certain general instructions for the preparation of
consolidated financial statements.
      1.   Accordingly, where a company is required to prepare Consolidated Financial Statements, i.e.,
           consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of profit and loss, the company shall mutatis
           mutandis follow the requirements of Schedule III of the Companies Act, 2013, as applicable to a company
           in the preparation of balance sheet and statement of profit and loss. In addition, the consolidated
           financial statements shall disclose the information as per the requirements specified in the applicable
           Accounting Standards including the following:
            (i) Profit or loss attributable to “minority interest” and to owners of the parent in the statement of
                profit and loss shall be presented as allocation for the period.
            (ii)   “Minority interests” in the balance sheet within equity shall be presented separately from the
                   equity of the owners of the parent.

 Calculation of Goodwill/Capital Reserve (Cost of Control)
As on the date of investment, the cost of investment and the equity in the subsidiary needs to be calculated. AS
21 defines equity as the ‘residual interest in the assets of an enterprise after deducting all its liabilities.’ In other
words, it is equal to the net worth of the enterprise. Once the above is calculated, goodwill or capital reserve is
calculated as under:

 Goodwill = Cost of Investment - Parent’s share in the equity of the subsidiary on date of investment


 Capital Reserve = Parent’s share in the equity of the subsidiary on date of investment – Cost of investment

The parent’s portion of equity in a subsidiary, at the date on which investment is made, is determined on the
basis of information contained in the financial statements of the subsidiary as on the date of investment.
However, if the financial statements of a subsidiary as on the date of investment are not available and if it is
impracticable to draw the financial statements of the subsidiary as on that date, financial statements of the
subsidiary for the immediately preceding period are used as a basis for consolidation.
Adjustments are made to these financial statements for the effects of significant transactions or other events
that occur between the date of such financial statements and the date of investment in the subsidiary.

                                                                                                                    267

It may be mentioned that positive or negative differential is separately recognised only in purchase method.
This differential calculated as cost of control is shown in the consolidated balance sheet.

                                     Rs. 2,40,000
		∴ proportionate share                             x 100 = 80%

 CONTENTS AND FORMAT OF CONSOLIDATED PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT
While preparing the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account of the holding company and its subsidiary, the items
appearing in the Profit and Loss Account of the holding and subsidiary companies have to be aggregated. But
in doing so, the following adjustments have to be made:
    (i)     Transfer of goods between the holding company and the subsidiary company should be eliminated
            both from the purchases and sales appearing in the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account.
   (ii)     Stock Reserve for unrealised profit in respect of inter-company transactions should be created by
            debiting Consolidated Profit and Loss Account and crediting Stock Reserve Account.
  (iii)     The share of profits of the subsidiary company arising before the date of acquisition of shares by the
            holding company that belongs to the holding company will be debited to the Consolidated Profit and
            Loss Account and credited to Capital Reserve or Goodwill Account as the case may be. In case of loss
            the entry will be just reversed.

                                                                                                                   273
EP-CA&FM                                                                                   Consolidation of Accounts

  (iv)    The share of profits or losses belonging to the minority shareholders will be respectively credited or
          debited to Minority Interest Account.
   (v)    Dividends received from the subsidiary company by the holding company should be eliminated from
          both the sides of the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account.
  (vi)    Care should be taken to see that both the companies pass entries for interest accrued and outstanding
          on debentures of the subsidiary company held by the holding company. The debenture interest should
          be eliminated from both the sides of the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account to the extent to which it
          relates to the debentures held by the holding company.
  (vii)   If the subsidiary company has passed entries for proposed dividend and the holding company has
          taken credit for its shares of the dividends, the holding company’s share should be eliminated from
          both the sides of the Consolidated Profit and Loss Statement. The necessary changes should also be
          made on both the sides of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. However, if the holding company has not
          passed entries for proposed dividends of the subsidiary company, the debit in respect of the proposed
          dividend should be reduced by the holding company’s share in such proposed dividend and obviously,
          the liability in respect of proposed dividend in the Consolidated Balance Sheet should also be reduced.
 (viii)   If there are profits and the dividends on cumulative preference shares are in arrears, the arrears of
          dividends on preference shares held by the Minority shareholders should be debited to the Consolidated
          Profit and Loss Account and credited to Minority Interest Account.
  (ix)    If fixed assets of the subsidiary company are revalued at the time of acquisition of shares by the holding
          company without any alteration in book-values, the excess or short depreciation should be adjusted by
          debiting or crediting the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account and crediting or debiting the respective
          Asset Account.
   (x)    The minority interest will consist of its proportion of total profits after adjustment of excess or short
          depreciation due to over or under valuation of fixed assets, but before adjusting the proportionate
          unrealised profit on stock.
It is important to note here that the consolidated Profit and Loss Statement has got no concern with the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. It is prepared in addition to the Consolidated Balance Sheet to serve the purpose
of showing the total profits earned by the group of companies for a particular period.

 (i) Date of acquisition     Date of acquisition refers to the date on which the relationship of holding company/
                             parent** and subsidiary company comes into existence.

 (ii) Pre-acquisition        Pre-acquisition period refers to the period beginning with the date of beginning of
                             the current accounting period and ending with the date immediately preceding
                             the date of acquistion of majority equity shares* by the holding company/parent**.

  Pre-acquisition profits*** and reserves refer to the undistributed portion of profits and reserves earned
  and created up to the date immediately preceding the date of acquisition of majority equity shares* by the
  holding company/parent**.
  Post-acquisition profits*** and reserves refer to the undistributed portion of profits and reserves earned
  and created on or after the date of acquisition of majority equity shares* by the holding company/parent**.

The share of holding company and minority interest is calculated as under:
Share of holding company/parent = (No. of equity shares held by the holding company/Total number of equity
shares* in subsidiary company) x 100
Minority/Non-controlling interest = (No. of equity shares* held by minority/Total number of equity shares* in
subsidiary company) x 100
*’Equity shares’ may alternatively be termed as ‘Equity interests’ or ‘Ordinary shares’ also as per Indian
Accounting Standards (Ind ASs)/International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs).
**The term ‘Holding company’ is used by the Companies Act, 2013 and the term ‘Parent’ is used by the AS 21/
Ind AS 110/IFRS 10. However, both the terms mean the same thing.
*** In the absence of any information to the contrary, the profits of a year are treated as accruing form day to
day on a uniform basis.
Summary of Treatment of pre-acquisition profits (or losses) and reserves and post-acquisition profits (or
losses) and reserves in a summarized form: After computation of these figures by means of analysis of profits
of the subsidiary as above, treat the same as under:

           Item                   Holding company’s share                             Minority

                            in the reserves shall be added to the       subsidiary company so as to calculate
                            reserves of the holding company.            the Minority Interest.

Note: It may be observed that whether the profit and surpluses and losses of subsidiary are pre-acquisition or
post-acquisition matters only in the case of holding company because the treatment for holding company diff
depending on whether these pre-or post. However, it does not make any difference for the minority interest at
all because all the profit and reserves whether pre-or post are included in the minority interest.

  Solution
  Basic Calculations:
      1.   Calculation of H Ltd.’s share in capital profit and reserve:
		 Step 1: Ratio of Equity Acquired and Held by Minority Interests:
                                          1,00,000
		 Total number of shares = Rs.           = 10,000 Shares
                                 10      .
		 Number of shares acquired by H Ltd. = 6,000 Shares
		 Number of shares held by minority interest by H Ltd. = 4,000 Shares
		∴ Ratio of Shares Acquired and Held by Minority Interest 6,000: 4,000
		 or 6: 4 or 3: 2
			                                                                                                  Rs.
		 Step 2: Shares in Pre-acquisition profit: 3/5 x Rs. 5,000 =                                    3,000
		 Share in Pre-acquisition reserves: 3/5 x Rs. 4,000 =                                           2,400
		 Step 3: Total amount to be transferred to capital reserve or to be                             5,400

Elimination of Inter-Company Balances and Amounts

  1.        Elimination of the    The terms ‘Parent’ and ‘Holding company’ are same and the terms ‘Subsidiary’
            cost to the parent    and ‘Subsidiary company’ are also same. The investment of holding company
           of its investment in   in subsidiary is presented under the sub-head ‘Non-current investments’ under
           subsidiary and the     the main head ‘Non-current assets’ on the Assets side of the holding company’s
            parent’s portion of   Balance Sheet. The parent’ portion of equity in subsidiary is shown under
           equity in subsidiary   ‘Share Capital’ of the subsidiary’s Balance sheet. Both are eliminated i.e.
                                  cancelled for preparing Consolidated Balance Sheet otherwise it will mean
                                  that the same company can make investment in the share capital of its own
                                  company which is completely illogical. Similarly, if the subsidiary company
                                  has investment in the holding company’s equity (which is possible only before
                                  it became a subsidiary), the represented portion of the equity of holding
                                  company and the corresponding investment of the subsidiary company
                                  should also be eliminated.

 2.          Elimination of       If any current or non-current asset is sold by one company to another
          unrealized profit on    company within the group i.e. the current or non-current asset is sold by the
           assets transferred     holding company to the subsidiary company or by the subsidiary company to
          between the holding     the holding company at a profit, there may be two situations as under:
             company and
                                  The buying company has sold the whole of such asset bought at a profit from
          subsidiary company
                                  the selling company till the end of the accounting year: In such a case, the
                                  question of elimination of the unrealized profit from the asset does not arise
                                  because there is no unsold asset as such with the buying company.

                                 The buying company has not sold the entire asset bought at a profit from
                                 the selling company till the end of the accounting year: In such a case, the
                                 unrealized profit on such unsold asset must be eliminated. The elimination
                                 should be done by debiting the Profit and Loss Account of the holding
                                 company and crediting the concerned asset by the amount of unrealized
                                 profit.
                                 It must be noted that if the asset under consideration is the depreciable fixed
                                 asset (i.e. the item of property, plant and equipment), the amount of unrealized
                                 profit should be computed only after providing for depreciation.
                                 Note: It does not make any difference which company in the group is the
                                 buyer and which company in the group is the seller. Calculation of ‘Minority
                                 interest’ and ‘Goodwill/Capital Reserve on consolidation’ is not in any way
                                 affected by the elimination of unrealized profit.

  3.       Elimination of        If the asset sold by one entity to another entity within the group at a loss is
         unrealized loss on      sold by the buying entity fully, there is no question of elimination of unrealized
         assets transferred      loss on the unsold asset. However, when such asset bought remains with
        between the holding      the buyer entity within the group either wholly or partly, then the unrealized
           company and           loss on such unsold asset may or may not be eliminated as per the situation
        subsidiary company       discussed as under:
                                 Unrealized losses resulting from intra group transactions should be eliminated
                                 only if cost can be recovered. It means that if the cost cannot be recovered by
                                 selling the asset, the unrealized loss should not be eliminated.
                                 If the unrealized loss is to be eliminated, the same is eliminated by debiting
                                 the concerned Asset A/c and crediting the Profit and Loss A/c of the holding
                                 company.
                                 Note: It does not make any difference which company in the group is the
                                 buyer and which company in the group is the seller. Calculation of ‘Minority
                                 interest’ and ‘Goodwill/Capital Reserve on consolidation’ are not in any way
                                 affected by the elimination of unrealized loss.

  4.     Elimination of intra-   Intra group balances should also be eliminated. The following may be the
           group balances        examples of intra group balances:
                                  a) Loan advanced by one company and taken by another company within
                                     the group;
                                  b) Debtors and creditors within the group;
                                  c) Bills receivable and bills payable within the group;
                                  d) Debentures shown on the Equity and Liabilities side of one company
                                     and investment in those debentures shown on the assets side of another
                                     company within the group;
                                  e) Prepaid expenses of one company and Income Received in Advance of
                                     another company within the group;
                                   f) Outstanding Expenses of one company and Accrued Income of another
                                      company within the group.

                                                                                                                281
EP-CA&FM                                                                                  Consolidation of Accounts


 5.       Adjustment of         The holding company may be the debtor of the subsidiary company or the
       remittance-in-transit    subsidiary company may be the debtor of the holding company within the
                                group. The debtor company may send cash to the creditor company but
                                the same may not be received by the creditor company by the end of the
                                accounting year. In such a case, the debtor company must have debited the
                                ‘Creditors A/c’ in its books at the time of sending cash. However, the creditor
                                company did not credit the ‘Debtors A/c’ and did not debit its ‘Cash/Bank
                                A/c’ because it did not receive the said cash by the end of the accounting
                                year. Hence, in the CBS, the ‘Debtors A/c’ of the recipient company should
                                be reduced and ‘Cash/Bank A/c’ should be increased by the amount of
                                remittance-in-transit. What applies to debtors and creditors may apply to any
                                other inter-company balances also.

 6.       Treatment of          The debentures of subsidiary company will be added with the debentures of
          debentures of         holding company. However, if some debentures of subsidiary company are
       Subsidiary Company       held by the holding company, then the paid-up value of such debentures held
         held by holding        will be eliminated from the aggregate of debentures of both the companies
            company             to be shown on the ‘Equity and Liabilities” side of the consolidated balance
                                sheet. Further, the cost of investment of holding company in such debentures
                                will be eliminated from the aggregate of investment to be shown on the
                                assets side of the consolidated balance sheet. The difference between the
                                cost of investment of the holding company in such debentures and the paid-
                                up value of such debentures of subsidiary company will be either profit or
                                loss on debentures held which will be added to or deducted from the balance
                                of profit and Loss Account of the holding company to find out the closing
                                balance of consolidated profit and Loss account of the holding company
                                to be taken to consolidated balance sheet. For this purpose, if the cost of
                                investment in debentures is more than the paid-up value of debentures, the
                                difference between the two is loss and in the reverse case, the difference
                                between the two is profit.

  7.       Treatment of         The paid-up value of debentures and cost of investment will be eliminated as
          debentures of         above. The difference between the paid-up value of debentures and the cost
        holding company         of investment of subsidiary will be taken in the analysis of profits of subsidiary
        held by subsidiary
                                Note: The aforesaid intra group amounts are eliminated by deducting the intra
             company
                                group items from the aggregate amounts of the respective items on both the
                                sides of the balance sheet.

 8.    Elimination of mutual    Contingent liability in respect of bills drawn by holding company/subsidiary
       contingent liabilities   company upon subsidiary company/holding company and discounted is
                                eliminated. For example. Suppose H Ltd. is the holding company and S Ltd.
                                is the subsidiary company. H Ltd. may draw a bill on S Ltd and hence the
                                bill is ‘Bills receivable’ for H Ltd. and is the Bills Payable for S Ltd. In such a
                                case, if H Ltd. discounts the bills receivable with the third party, say, Bank, the
                                contingent liability of H Ltd. and S Ltd. in respect of bills discounted should
                                be added and from the total, the bills accepted by S Ltd. which have been
                                discounted by H Ltd. should be deducted as a mutual contingent liability. The
                                same process will be adopted if S Ltd. has drawn a bill upon H Ltd. and the
                                said bills have been discounted by S Ltd. with the third party. Thus, for Notes

                                 Thus, the formula for contingent liabilities for bills receivable may be written
                                 as under:
                                 Contingent liabilities for Bills receivable (for Notes to Account to CBS) =Bills
                                 receivable drawn and discounted by holding company+ Bills receivable drawn
                                 and discounted by subsidiary company-Bills receivable drawn by holding
                                 company upon subsidiary company and discounted-Bills receivable drawn
                                 by subsidiary company upon holding company and discounted.

 Revaluation of Fixed Assets of Subsidiary and Treatment

 (i) Computationof Profit Part I: Computation: The computation of profit or loss on revaluation of fixed assets
 or loss on revaluation is done as under:
 and treatment thereof
                          Revalued figure is compared with the carrying amount (i.e. the book value) as on the
                          date of revaluation and the difference between the two figures is either profit or loss
                          on revaluation of fixed assets which is as under:
                             (a) If the revalued figure as on the date of revaluation is more than the carrying
                                 amount on the date of revaluation, there is a profit on revaluation i.e. Profit on
                                 revaluation=Revalued figure on the date of revaluation-carrying amount on
                                 the date of revaluation.

                           (b) If the revalued figure as on the date of Revaluation is less than the carrying
                               amount as on the date of revaluation, there is a loss on revaluation i.e. Loss
                               on revaluation=Carrying amount on the date of Revaluation-Revalued figure
                               as on the date of revaluation.
                          Part II: Treatment: The treatment of profit or loss on revaluation of fixed assets may
                          be explained as under:
                          (a) Pre-acquisition profit: Profit on revaluation of fixed asset related to the period
                              before the date of acquisition is pre-acquisition profit. This is treated as capital
                              profit in the analysis of profits of subsidiary.
                          (b) Post-acquisition profit: Profit on revaluation of fixed assets related to the
                              period after the date of acquisition is post-acquisition profit. However, it is
                              capital profit and not revenue profit. Holding company’s share in post-
                              acquisition profit on revaluation of fixed asset should be shown separately
                              in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Minority’s share therein will be added to
                              the Minority interest.
                          (c) Pre-acquisition loss: Loss on revaluation of fixed assets related to the period
                              before the date of acquisition is pre-acquisition loss. Such loss should be
                              deducted from the capital profit in the analysis of profits of subsidiary.
                          (d) Post-acquisition loss: Loss on revaluation of fixed asset related to the period
                              after the date of acquisition is post-acquisition loss and will be treated like
                              revenue losses. Holding company’s share therein will be deducted from the
                              balance of P&L A/c of Holding Company in the computation of consolidated
                              P&L A/c balance. Minority’s share therein will be deducted from minority’s
                              interest.
(ii) Computation of       Part I: Computation: The first point is whether we should consider the depreciation
Depreciation in case      in case of revaluation i.e. shortage/deficiency of depreciation on increase in the
of revaluation of items   value of fixed assets or excess/surplus of depreciation on decrease in the value
of PPE and treatment      of fixed assets. Normally, if the subsidiary company has revalued the assets in its
thereof                   books, it would have provided depreciation also on the revalued figure. Hence, no
                          readjustment is required.
                          However, when the subsidiary company’s balance sheet shows the asset at its original
                          figure, then we will have to account for the shortage/deficiency of depreciation or
                          excess/surplus depreciation for the period from the date of revaluation till the end
                          of the accounting year. The computation of short or excess depreciation is done as
                          under:
                            (a)   Shortage/deficiency of depreciation on increase in the value of fixed
                                  assets= (Increase in the value of fixed assets*rate of depreciation*Period
                                  from date of revaluation till the end of accounting year)/12.
                            (b)   Excess/surplus depreciation on decrease in revaluation of fixed asset=
                                  (Decrease in the value of fixed asset*Rate of depreciation*Period from the
                                  date of revaluation of fixed asset till the end of the accounting year)/12.
                          Part II: Treatment: The treatment of short or excess depreciation on revaluation of
                          fixed asset may be explained as under:

                                 (a)   Shortage/Deficiency of depreciation: The portion of shortage/deficiency
                                       of depreciation which is attributable to the post-acquisition period is
                                       treated like any other revenue expense and hence is deducted from the
                                       post-acquisition profit i.e. it is shown as a negative figure in the column of
                                       revenue profit in the analysis of profits of subsidiary.
                                 (b)   Excess/surplus depreciation: The portion of excess/surplus depreciation
                                       which is attributable to the post-acquisition period is treated like any other
                                       revenue profit and hence is added to the post-acquisition profit i.e. it is
                                       shown as a positive figure in the analysis of profits of subsidiary.
                            Note: It must be very clear that either shortage/deficiency of depreciation or excess/
                            surplus of depreciation, as the case may be, belong to the post- acquisition period
                            only if the date of revaluation is the date of acquisition. Normally, the revaluation
                            of fixed assets takes place on the date of acquisition. However, if the date of
                            revaluation is before the date of acquisition then either shortage/deficiency of
                            depreciation or excess/surplus of depreciation, as the case may be, belongs to both
                            the pre-acquisition period and the post-acquisition period and should accordingly
                            be included in the computation of pre-acquisition and post-acquisition profit.

Bonus Shares Issued by Subsidiary Company

       Situation                                            Treatment


(i)    Accounting    If Accounting effect has already been given by subsidiary in its books, nothing will be
effect of bonus      done further. If the problem on hand only states that during the year, bonus shares have
issue      already   been issued and does not state anything as to whether the accounting entry for the said
given in the books   bonus issue has been passed or not, it is presumed that the accounting entry for the said
of subsidiary        bonus issue has been passed in the books.

(ii)  Accounting     In such a case, the following pieces of work will be done:
effect of bonus
                      (a) The balance of profits and reserves out of which bonus shares have been issued
issue not given
                          should be reduced by passing the following entry:
in the books of
subsidiary           		 General Reserve A/c/ P&L A/c          Dr.
                     			 To Equity Share Capital A/c
                     		Note: Normally, if nothing is mentioned in the problem as to whether general
                       reserve has been used or P&L A/c has been used for issue of bonus shares, the first
                       preference should go in favour of the use of general reserve and the second one in
                       favour of the use P&L A/c.
                      (b) The paid-up value of bonus shares allotted to the minority after the date of
                          acquisition should be added to the paid-up value of equity shares held by the
                          minority.
                     		 The paid-up value of bonus shares allotted to the holding company after the date
                        of acquisition must be added to the paid-up value of equity shares held by the
                        holding company.
                     		Note: As usual, no entry is passed in the books of the holding company (or for that
                       in the books of any recipient company) for the receipt of bonus shares.

Treatment of Dividend
1. Treatment of dividend received: Such dividend received may be either final dividend for the previous year
   paid by subsidiary during the current year or interim dividend paid by subsidiary for the current year during
   the current year. This point may be explained as under:

         (i) Nature of      The dividend received from the subsidiary company will be either capital dividend
      dividend received     or revenue dividend.

       (ii) Meaning of      Capital dividend means the dividend which is received out of the pre-acquisition
      capital dividend      profits of the subsidiary. Revenue dividend means the dividend received out of post-
        and revenue         acquisition profits of the subsidiary.
            dividend
                            When information is given in the problem as to out of which profits dividend has been
                            paid by subsidiary, the amount of capital dividend and revenue dividend may be
                            easily determined. But, the problem may arise when such information is not given in
                            the question.

        (iii)What to do     In such a case, either of the following two assumptions may be made:
         if information
                            Assumption No. (i): Dividend has been paid out of current year’s profit: If it is assumed
           as to out of
                            that dividend has been paid out of current year’s profits and the dividend paid by
          which profits
                            subsidiary is more than current year’s profits, then the excess of dividend paid over
       Dividend is paid
                            current year’s profits should be assumed to be paid out of earlier year’s profits.
      is not given in the
                            Accordingly, depending on the date of acquisition, the dividend shall be assumed to
            problem?
                            be paid out of pre-acquisition profits and post-acquisition profits.
                            Assumption No. (ii): Dividend has been paid out of earlier year’s profits: If dividend
                            is assumed to be paid out of earlier year’s profits and the date of acquisition is in
                            the current year, then the entire dividend will be treated as first paid out of earlier
                            year’s profits and the balance amount of dividend, if any, which is in excess of earlier
                            year’s profit shall be assumed to be paid out of current year’s profits. Accordingly,
                            depending on the date of acquisition, the dividend shall be assumed to be paid out
                            of pre-acquisition profits and post-acquisition profits.

      (iv) Treatment of     Capital dividend received by the holding company is deducted from its cost of
      capital dividend      investments in the equity shares of subsidiary company while computing goodwill/
                            capital reserve.

                            However, if capital dividend received by the holding company is already credited to
                            its P&L A/c, the same will be rectified by the holding company by debiting its P&L A/c
                            and crediting its ‘Investments in equity shares in Subsidiary Company A/c’. Para 12 of
                            AS 13 “Accounting for Investments” also requires, inter alia, that dividend on equity
                            shares declared out of pre-acquisition profits is deducted from cost of investments.
                            Note: Capital dividend received by the minority requires no treatment.

      (v) Treatment of      Revenue dividend received by the holding company is credited to its P&L A/c. Note:
     revenue dividend       Revenue dividend received by the minority requires no treatment.


2. Treatment of dividend on preference shares: This point may be dealt with under two situations as under:

          Situation         Treatment

      (a) Preference        This will be totally ignored for the consolidation for the year of proposal of dividend
     dividend on non-       and hence will not be deducted from the profit for the analysis of profits of subsidiary.
     cumulative pref.       Subsidiary company will show the same by way of the notes to accounts to the CBS
     shares proposed        titled ‘Proposed dividends and Corporate Dividend tax thereon’ view of paragraph
       by subsidiary        14 of revised AS 4 as under:
        during the
                            ‘Dividend proposed to be distributed to preference shareholders for the year….
       current year
                            Rs. .....… (Rs. ... per share)’ Corporate dividend tax Rs…….

     (b) Pref. dividend     This will be deducted from the profit of subsidiary in the year of declaration. Such
          on non-           dividend will be divided between the holding company and minority for the purpose
      cumulative pref.      of consolidation for the year of declaration. Holding company’s share shall be
      shares declared       divided between pre-acquisition and post-acquisition dividend and shall be dealt
       by subsidiary        with by it accordingly. Minority share shall be added to the minority interest.
         during the
        current year

      (c) Preference        Case 1: When some portion of cumulative preference shares is held by the minority:
       dividend on          In such a case, para 27 of AS 21 will apply. Hence, the preference dividend will
     cumulative pref.       be deducted from the profit of subsidiary. The pref. dividend so deducted shall be
     shares proposed        divided between holding and minority. Holding company’s share of such dividend
      by subsidiary         will be divided between pre-and post- portion and will be dealt with accordingly.
        during the          Minority’s share of such dividend shall be added to the minority interest. The
       current year         remaining balance of P&LA/c of the subsidiary shall be divided between the holding
                            company and the minority. It may be carefully noted that the adjustment for the
                            dividend on cumulative preference shares for the current year shall be made even

                            P&L A/c in the books of subsidiary before such adjustment shall increase by the
                            adjustment of such preference dividend and hence, the increased debit balance of
                            P&L A/c of subsidiary shall be shared by both the holding company and minority.
                            In the year of declaration of such proposed dividend, such preference dividend is not
                            again deducted from profit of subsidiary for consolidation in the year of declaration
                            because it has already been deducted from profit of subsidiary in the previous year.



                                                                                                                  291

                          Case 2: When no portion of cumulative preference shares is held by the minority
                          i.e. all preference shares of subsidiary are held by holding company: It will be simply
                          ignored for consolidation purpose in the year of proposal. In the year of declaration
                          by subsidiary, such preference dividend shall be deducted from profit of subsidiary.
                          Further, the said declared dividend shall be treated by holding as pre-acquisition or
                          post-acquisition dividend, as the case may be, and dealt with accordingly.

        (d) Preference    Case 1 : When some portion of cumulative preference shares is held by the minority:
         dividend on      In such a case, para 27 of AS 21 will apply. Hence, the preference dividend will
          cumulative      be deducted from the profit of subsidiary. The pref. dividend so deducted shall be
          preference      divided between holding and minority. Holding company’s share of such dividend will
          shares not      be divided between pre-and post-portion and will be dealt with accordingly. Minority’s
         proposed by      share of such dividend shall be added to the minority interest. The remaining balance
      subsidiary during   of P&L A/c of the subsidiary shall be divided between the holding company and the
       the current year   minority. It may be carefully noted that the adjustment for the dividend on cumulative
                          preference shares for the current year shall be made even if the subsidiary has a
                          debit balance of P&L A/c in which case, the debit balance of P&L A/c in the books of
                          subsidiary before such adjustment shall increase by the adjustment of the arrears of
                          preference dividend and hence, the increased debit balance of P&L A/c of subsidiary
                          shall be shared by both the holding company and minority.
                          In the year of payment of such arrears of dividend by subsidiary, it will not be
                          deducted again from profit of subsidiary for consolidation purpose because it has
                          already been deducted from the profit of subsidiary in the concerned previous
                          year. Rather, in the year of payment, the same will be divided between holding
                          and minority. Holding company’s share shall be treated as pre- or post-acquisition
                          dividend and shall be dealt with accordingly in its books. Minority will also deal with
                          the receipt of dividend as capital income or revenue income as the case may be.
                          Case 2: When no portion of cumulative preference shares is held by the minority i.e.
                          all preference shares of subsidiary are held by holding company: It will be simply
                          ignored and will not be deducted from the profit of the subsidiary for consolidation
                          purpose. Further, arrears of fixed cumulative dividend shall be disclosed in the
                          notes to accounts in the CBS. In the year of payment of such arrears of dividend by
                          subsidiary, it will be deducted from profit of subsidiary for consolidation purpose.
                          Rather, in the year of payment, the same will be treated as pre-or post-acquisition
                          dividend, as the case may be.

3. Treatment of Equity dividend: This point may be dealt with under two situations as under:

          (a) Equity      This will be ignored for the purpose of consolidation because this will not be
           dividend       adjusted by the subsidiary in the books of account for the year of proposal in view
         proposed by      of para 14 of revised AS 4. Such proposed dividend is simply shown in the notes
      subsidiary during   to accounts to the Balance sheet related to the year of proposal. This is adjusted
       the current year   by the subsidiary in the books in the year of declaration in which case, this will be
                          divided between holding company and minority for the purpose of consolidation
                          for the year of declaration. Accordingly, holding company shall divide its share of
                          declared dividend between pre-acquisition dividend and post- acquisition dividend
                          and shall treat accordingly. Minority’s share of such declared dividend shall be
                          added to minority interest.

         (b) Equity          It will be simply ignored for the consolidation. It will not be mentioned even in the
        dividend not         notes to accounts to the balance sheet of the subsidiary.
        proposed by
     subsidiary during
      the current year

          (c) Equity         The entry will be passed if the same has not already been passed. If nothing is
     dividend declared       mentioned whether the entry for declaration of equity dividend has been passed or
                             not, it will be presumed that the entry has been passed.

 Treatment of Goodwill appearing in the Balance Sheet of Subsidiary Company
If, the goodwill is shown in the balance sheet of the subsidiary company. That means goodwill already exists.
Accounting Treatment:
Approach I: Add: Goodwill already appearing in the balance sheet of subsidiary company to the goodwill and/
or cost of control in the consolidated balance sheet.
Approach II: Add: Only holding company’s share to the cost of control/goodwill, from the goodwill of the
subsidiary company.

 INTRODUCTION
The process of critical evaluation of the financial information contained in the financial statements in order to
understand and make decisions regarding the operations of the firm or entity is called ‘Financial Statement
Analysis’. It is basically a study of relationship among various financial facts and figures as given in a set
of financial statements, and the interpretation thereof to gain an insight into the profitability and operational
efficiency of the firm to assess its financial health and future prospects.
The term ‘financial analysis’ includes both ‘analysis and interpretation’. The term analysis means simplification
of financial data by methodical classification given in the financial statements. Interpretation means explaining
the meaning and significance of the data. These two are complimentary to each other. Analysis is useless
without interpretation, and interpretation without analysis is difficult or even impossible.
Financial statement analysis is a judgemental process which aims to estimate current and past financial
positions and the results of the operation of an enterprise, with primary objective of determining the best
possible estimates and predictions about the future conditions. It essentially involves regrouping and analysis of
information provided by financial statements to establish relationships and throw light on the points of strengths
and weaknesses of a business enterprise, which can be useful in decision-making involving comparison with
other firms (cross sectional analysis) and with firms’ own performance, over a time period.
While information found in published financial statements is often not enough to form conclusive judgments
about firm performance, financial statements do provide important clues about what needs to be examined
in greater detail. Analysis of financial statements is of interest to lenders (short-term as well as long-term),
investors, security analysts, managers, corporate boards, regulators, and others. Financial statement analysis
may be done for a variety of purposes, which may range from a simple analysis of the short-term liquidity
position of the firm to a comprehensive assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the firm in various areas.
It is helpful in assessing corporate excellence, judging creditworthiness, forecasting bond ratings, predicting
bankruptcy, and assessing market risk. This chapter discusses how information can be extracted from financial
statements for analysing financial performance.

 CHARACTERISTICS OF GOOD FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND ITS RELEVANCY FOR BETTER
 REPORTING
The following are all qualitative characteristics of financial statements:




Understandability
The information must be readily understandable to users of the financial statements. This means that information
must be clearly presented, with additional information supplied in the supporting footnotes as needed to assist
in clarification.


326
Financial Statement Analysis                                                                            LESSON 8

Relevance
The information must be relevant to the needs of the users, which is the case when the information influences
their economic decisions. This may involve reporting particularly relevant information, or information whose
omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users.

Reliability
The information must be free of material error and bias, and not misleading. Thus, the information should
faithfully represent transactions and other events, reflect the underlying substance of events, and prudently
represent estimates and uncertainties through proper disclosure.

Comparability
The information must be comparable to the financial information presented for other accounting periods, so that
users can identify trends in the performance and financial position of the reporting entity.

 Relevancy of Better Reporting in Financial Statement
Relevance in accounting means the information we get from the accounting system will help the end-users
to make important decisions. End users can be either internal or external stakeholders. Internal stakeholders
include managers, employees, and business owners. By external stakeholders, we mean investors, lenders, etc.
Therefore relevance in accounting indicates the capacity to influence the end-users of the financial statement
in their decision-making process.
The next thing we should understand is which information would be relevant for whom?
    l   The company’s annual report, which the company managers prepare, is important to the shareholders.
        Now there may be different kinds of shareholders in a company. The shareholders who hold some
        shares in the company are more interested in the share price per day. The share price will never be
        mentioned in a balance sheet or the income statement. The balance sheet and the income statement
        show the ability to generate future cash flows. In this way, the shareholders will find meaning in it, and
        it will be useful for their decision making the purpose of investment.
    l   A manager who is an insider of the company will be in charge of making strategic or operational
        decisions based on the situation. Like the manager has to estimate the price/profitability of a product.
        This information will directly not be available in the annual report. The annual report, which the
        managers generally prepare, will help the manager with the pricing of a product. So by taking the
        annual report, keeping in mind the accounting principles and going backward in a calculation, the
        manager can calculate the price/profitability of a product.
    l   The shareholder who holds a large number of shares in the company will be more interested in
        knowing the profit generated and distributed by the company. But it must also be understood that the
        shareholders should not jump to a conclusion by only seeing the current financial report. It should also
        understand the assumptions and policies followed in making the accounting report. Then by using
        the numbers for some time, it will be able to understand the profit generated and profit distributed,
        which the annual reports will also throw light on. In this way, the information will be relevant for the
        shareholders in making a decision.
Every stakeholder needs useful information. It is why the relevance principle is of prime importance to financial
accounting.
Example 1
If a company wants to take a loan from a bank, then the bank will want to know first whether the company

                                                                                                              327
EP-CA&FM                                                                              Financial Statement Analysis

will be able to pay them back the loan with interest. Therefore, the company’s financial statements should be
relevant for the bank in making its decision regarding granting a loan to the company.
Financial statements like balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow present important information to
the banker in making decisions. It should also be noted that the information should be timely. The banker will
not consider the financial statements which are old.
The information should be understandable. In addition, the financial statement should be in proper accounting
format. Lastly, the information should be useful for the banker in deciding whether to grant a loan to the
company or not.




Example 2
A company, ABC, announces that its earning per share have increased from Rs. 40 to Rs. 45. It is important and
relevant information for the investors in making their decision as growing earnings provide a good return for the
investors.
Example 3
In mergers and acquisitions, the acquirer will be willing to pay the premium as it will expect the synergies
(expected increase in revenue, cost savings) generated by the acquisitions. The acquirer can estimate the
synergies from the enterprise value of the firm, which again will be calculated from the balance sheet of the
Target Company, and EBITDA, which could be taken from the financial report of the target company. It is a piece
of important and relevant information for the acquirer as it will influence its decision, whether paying a premium
for the target company is worthwhile or not. If timely and accurate information is not provided, the acquirer
might underestimate or overestimate the company, which will be a great loss for the acquirer.
A financial statement is relevant when it has data that is valuable enough to make predictions /estimations
about future events like calculating the future cash flows, which will be important to the investors in making
decisions. Many stakeholders also use past financial statements to analyze the company’s future performance
regarding profitability. It should be accurate data following accounting standards. Any inaccurate information
may be misleading. Therefore any such false data doesn’t come under the definition of accounting relevance.
This kind of information cannot be of any use to the company in making decisions.
In short, accounting relevance should contain accurate and orderly information. The relevance of accounting
numbers depends on the person using them. And it will hold more meaning if it has been used over some
time and is more useful if one understands the generally accepted accounting principles based on which the
financial report has been prepared.

Financial Statement Analysis                                                                            LESSON 8

 USAGE AND FEATURES OF RATIO ANALYSIS
Ratio analysis refers to the analysis of various pieces of financial information in the financial statements of a
business. They are mainly used by external analysts to determine various aspects of a business, such as its
profitability, liquidity, and solvency.




Analysts rely on current and past financial statements to obtain data to evaluate the financial performance of
a company. They use the data to determine if a company’s financial health is on an upward or downward trend
and to draw comparisons to other competing firms.

Uses of Ratio Analysis
 1.   Comparisons
		One of the uses of ratio analysis is to compare a company’s financial performance to similar firms in the
  industry to understand the company’s position in the market. Obtaining financial ratios, such as Price/
  Earnings, from known competitors and comparing it to the company’s ratios can help management identify
  market gaps and examine its competitive advantages, strengths, and weaknesses. The management can
  then use the information to formulate decisions that aim to improve the company’s position in the market.
2.    Trend line
		 Companies can also use ratios to see if there is a trend in financial performance. Established companies
   collect data from the financial statements over a large number of reporting periods. The trend obtained can
   be used to predict the direction of future financial performance, and also identify any expected financial
   turbulence that would not be possible to predict using ratios for a single reporting period.
3.    Operational efficiency
		 The management of a company can also use financial ratio analysis to determine the degree of efficiency
   in the management of assets and liabilities. Inefficient use of assets such as motor vehicles, land, and
   building results in unnecessary expenses that ought to be eliminated. Financial ratios can also help to
   determine if the financial resources are over- or under-utilized.

 FINANCIAL RATIOS
A ratio is an arithmetical relationship between two figures. Financial ratio analysis is a study of ratios between
various items or groups of items in financial statements. Financial ratios have been classified in several ways.
For our purposes, we divide them into four broad categories as follows:
      l   Liquidity Ratios


                                                                                                              329
EP-CA&FM                                                                                  Financial Statement Analysis

      l   Leverage / Solvency Ratios
      l   Turnover Ratios
      l   Profitability Ratios

 A. Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity refers to the ability of a firm to meet its obligations in the short run, usually one year. Liquidity
ratios are generally based on the relationship between current assets (the sources for meeting short-term
obligations) and current liabilities. The important liquidity ratios are: current ratio, acid-test ratio, and cash
ratio.

                         Current Assets
1. Current Ratio:
                        Current liabilities
		 Current assets include cash, current investments, debtors, inventories (stocks), loans and advances, and pre-
   paid expenses. Current liabilities represent liabilities that are expected to mature in the next twelve months.
   These comprise (i) loans, secured or unsecured, that are due in the next twelve months and (ii) current
   liabilities and provisions.
		 Normally, a high current ratio is considered to be a sign of financial strength. Bankers in India have used a
   norm of 1.33. Internationally, the norm is 2.0. In interpreting the current ratio, the composition of current assets
   must not be overlooked-perhaps inventories may be slow-moving and a portion of loans and advances may
   represent dues from associate companies which may be sticky.

      Illustration 1:
      Calculate Current Ratio from the following information:

                                              Particulars                                        (Rs.)
                        Inventories                                                            50,000
                        Trade receivables                                                      50,000
                        Advance tax                                                             4,000
                        Cash and cash equivalents                                              30,000
                        Trade payables                                                        1,00,000
                        Short-term borrowings (bank overdraft)                                  4,000

      Solution:
      Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
      Current Assets = Inventories + Trade receivables + Advance tax + Cash and cash equivalents
      = Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 4,000 + Rs. 30,000 = Rs. 1,34,000
      Current Liabilities = Trade payables + Short-term borrowings
      = Rs. 1,00,000 + Rs. 4,000 = Rs. 1,04,000
      Current Ratio = Rs.1,34,000 / Rs.1,04,000
      = 1.29 :1



330
Financial Statement Analysis                                                                            LESSON 8

    Significance: It provides a measure of degree to which current assets cover current liabilities. The excess
    of current assets over current liabilities provides a measure of safety margin available against uncertainty
    in realisation of current assets and flow of funds. The ratio should be reasonable. It should neither be very
    high or very low. Both the situations have their inherent disadvantages. A very high current ratio implies
    heavy investment in current assets which is not a good sign as it reflects under utilisation or improper
    utilisation of resources. A low ratio endangers the business and puts it at risk of facing a situation where
    it will not be able to pay its short-term debt on time. If this problem persists, it may affect firm’s credit
    worthiness adversely. Normally, it is safe to have this ratio within the range of 2:1.

                                              Current Assets - Inventories
2. Acid-test Ratio / Quick / Liquid Ratio:
                                                   Current liabilities
		 Quick assets are defined as current assets excluding inventories and other current assets such as prepaid
   expenses, advance tax, etc. This is a fairly stringent measure of liquidity as it excludes inventories, perhaps
   the least liquid of current assets, from the numerator.

    Illustration 2:
    Calculate quick ratio from the information given in illustration 1.
    Solution:
    Quick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities
    Quick Assets = Current assets – (Inventories + Advance tax)
    = Rs. 1,34,000 – (Rs. 50,000 + Rs. 4,000) = Rs. 80,000
    Current Liabilities = Rs. 1,04,000
    Quick Ratio = Rs. 80,000 / Rs. 1,04,000
    = 0.77 :1


    Illustration 3:
    X Ltd., has a current ratio of 3.5:1 and quick ratio of 2:1. If excess of current assets over quick assets
    represented by inventories is Rs. 24,000, calculate current assets and current liabilities.
    Solution:
    Current Ratio = 3.5:1
    Quick Ratio = 2:1
    Let Current liabilities = x
    Current assets = 3.5x
    and Quick assets = 2x
    Inventories = Current assets – Quick assets
    24,000 = 3.5x – 2x
    24,000 = 1.5x
    x = Rs.16,000
    Current Liabilities = Rs.16,000
    Current Assets = 3.5x = 3.5 × Rs. 16,000 = Rs. 56,000.



                                                                                                              331
EP-CA&FM                                                                                 Financial Statement Analysis


      Significance: The ratio provides a measure of the capacity of the business to meet its short-term
      obligations without any flaw. Normally, it is advocated to be safe to have a ratio of 1:1 as unnecessarily
      low ratio will be very risky and a high ratio suggests unnecessarily deployment of resources in otherwise
      less profitable short-term investments.

3. Cash Ratio Sometimes, financial analysts look at cash ratio, which is defined as:

                                 Cash and bank balances + Current investments
                                                  Current liabilities
		This is a very stringent measure of liquidity. Indeed lack of immediate cash may not matter if the firm can
		 stretch its payments or borrow money at short notice.

 B. Leverage / Solvency Ratios
Financial leverage refers to the use of debt finance. While debt capital is a cheaper source of finance, it is also
a riskier source of finance. Leverage ratios help in assessing the risk arising from the use of debt capital. Two
types of ratios are commonly used to analyse financial leverage: structural ratios and coverage ratios.
Structural ratios are based on the proportions of debt and equity in the financial structure of the firm. The
important structural ratios are: debt-equity ratio and debt-assets ratio.
Coverage ratios show the relationship between debt servicing commitments and the sources for meeting these
burdens. The important coverage ratios are: interest coverage ratio, fixed charges coverage ratio, and debt
service coverage ratio.
1. Debt-equity Ratio
		Debt-Equity Ratio measures the relationship between long-term debt and equity. If debt component of the
  total long-term funds employed is small, outsiders feel more secure. From security point of view, capital
  structure with less debt and more equity is considered favourable as it reduces the chances of bankruptcy.
  Normally, it is considered to be safe if debt equity ratio is 2 : 1. However, it may vary from industry to industry.
  It is computed as follows:
		 Debt-Equity Ratio = Long Term Debts / Shareholders’ Funds
		where:
		Shareholders’ Funds (Equity) = Share capital + Reserves and Surplus + Money received against share
  warrants
		 Share Capital = Equity share capital + Preference share capital
		or
		 Shareholders’ Funds (Equity) = Non-current Assets + Working capital – Non-current liabilities
		 Working Capital = Current Assets – Current Liabilities

      Significance: This ratio measures the degree of indebtedness of an enterprise and gives an idea to the
      long-term lender regarding extent of security of the debt. As indicated earlier, a low debt equity ratio
      reflects more security. A high ratio, on the other hand, is considered risky as it may put the firm into
      difficulty in meeting its obligations to outsiders. However, from the perspective of the owners, greater use
      of debt (trading on equity) may help in ensuring higher returns for them if the rate of earnings on capital
      employed is higher than the rate of interest payable.

                                                                                                    333
EP-CA&FM                                                                                   Financial Statement Analysis


      		Solution:
      		Debt-Equity Ratio = Long - term Debts / Equity (Shareholders’ Funds)
      		 Long-term Debts = Long-term Borrowings = Rs. 1,50,000
      		 Equity = Share capital + Reserves and surplus
      		 = Rs. 8,00,000 + Rs. 1,00,000 = Rs. 9,00,000
      		 Debt Equity Ratio = 1,50,000 / 9,00,000
      		 = .1667
2. Debt to Capital Employed Ratio: The Debt to capital employed ratio refers to the ratio of long-term debt to
   the total of external and internal funds (capital employed or net assets). It is computed as follows:
		 Debt to Capital Employed Ratio = Long-term Debt/Capital Employed (or Net Assets)
		 Capital employed is equal to the long-term debt + shareholders’ funds. Alternatively, it may be taken as net
   assets which are equal to the total assets – current liabilities

      Significance: Like debt-equity ratio, it shows proportion of long-term debts in capital employed. Low ratio
      provides security to lenders and high ratio helps management in trading on equity. In the above case,
      the debt to Capital Employed ratio is less than half which indicates reasonable funding by debt and
      adequate security of debt. It may be noted that Debt to Capital Employed Ratio can also be computed in
      relation to total assets. In that case, it usually refers to the ratio of total debts (long-term debts + current
      liabilities) to total assets, i.e., total of noncurrent and current assets (or shareholders’, funds + long-term
      debts + current liabilities), and is expressed as
      Debt to Capital Employed Ratio = Total Debts / Total Assets


      Illustration 5:
      Company A lists Rs. 40,00,000 in short-term liabilities and Rs. 70,00,000 in long-term liabilities on their
      balance sheet. They’ve also issued Rs. 20,00,000 in preferred stock, Rs. 5,00,000 in minority interest,
      and have around Rs. 8,00,000 outstanding shares trading at Rs. 10 per share. Using all that information,
      calculate the debt-to-capital ratio.
      Solution:
      Debt-to-Capital Ratio = (Rs. 40 lakhs + Rs. 70 lakhs) / (Rs. 40 lakhs + Rs. 70 lakhs) + (Rs. 20 lakhs + Rs. 5
      lakhs) + (Rs. 8 lakhs x Rs. 10)
      = 110 lakhs / 215 lakhs
      = 0.512
      In other words, 51.2% of Company A’s operations are funded with debt, rather than capital. This makes it
      a relatively risky proposition, as the business is aggressively financing growth activities with debt.

3. Interest Coverage Ratio Also called the times interest earned, the interest coverage ratio is defined as:

                                             Profit before interest and taxes
                                               Interest on Long term debts
		Profit before interest and taxes are used in the numerator of this ratio because the ability of a firm to pay
  interest is not affected by tax payment, as interest on debt funds is a tax-deductible expense. A high interest

Financial Statement Analysis                                                                           LESSON 8

   coverage ratio means that the firm can easily meet its interest burden even if earnings before interest and
   taxes suffer a considerable decline. A low interest coverage ratio may result in financial embarrassment
   when earnings before interest and taxes decline. This ratio is widely used by lenders to assess a firm’s debt
   capacity. Further, it is a major determinant of bond rating.

    Significance: It reveals the number of times interest on long-term debts is covered by the profits available
    for interest. A higher ratio ensures safety of interest on debts.

		Though widely used, this ratio is not a very appropriate measure of interest coverage because the source
  of interest payment is cash flow before interest and taxes, not earnings before interest and taxes. In view of
  this, we may use a modified interest coverage ratio:

                                   Profit before interest and taxes + Depreciation
                                                    Debt interest

    Illustration 6:
    From the following details, calculate interest coverage ratio: Net Profit after tax Rs. 60,000; 15% Long-
    term debt 10,00,000; and Tax rate 40%.
    Solution:
    Net Profit after Tax = Rs. 60,000
    Tax Rate = 40%
    Net Profit before tax = Net profit after tax × 100/(100 – Tax rate)
    = Rs. 60,000 × 100/(100 – 40) = Rs. 1,00,000
    Interest on Long-term Debt = 15% of Rs. 10,00,000 = Rs. 1,50,000
    Net profit before interest and tax = Net profit before tax + Interest
    = Rs. 1,00,000 + Rs. 1,50,000 = Rs. 2,50,000
    Interest Coverage Ratio = Net Profit before Interest and Tax/Interest on long-term debt
    = Rs. 2,50,000/Rs. 1,50,000
    = 1.67 times

4. Fixed Charges Coverage Ratio This ratio shows how many times the cash flow before interest and taxes
   covers all fixed financing charges. It is defined as:

                                   Profit before interest and taxes + Depreciation
                                     Repayment of loan Interest + (1 – Tax rate)
		 In the denominator of this ratio only the repayment of loan is adjusted upwards for the tax factor because the
   loan repayment amount, unlike interest, is not tax deductible.
		This ratio measures debt servicing ability comprehensively because it considers both the interest and
  the principal repayment obligations. The ratio may be amplified to include other fixed charges like lease
  payment and preference dividends.
		 The fixed charge coverage ratio has to be interpreted with care because short-term loan funds like working
   capital loans and commercial paper tend to be self-renewing in nature and hence do not have to be ordinarily
   repaid from cash flows generated by operations. Hence, a fixed charge coverage ratio of less 1 need not be
   viewed with much concern.


                                                                                                             335
EP-CA&FM                                                                                 Financial Statement Analysis

5. Debt Service Coverage Ratio Used by financial institutions in India, the debt service coverage ratio is defined
   as:

            Profit after tax +Depreciation +Other non-cash charges Interest on term loan + Lease rentals
                           Interest on term loan + Lease rentals + Repayment of term loan

      Significance: Financial institutions calculate the average debt service coverage ratio for the period
      during which the term loan for the project is repayable. Normally, financial institutions regard a debt
      service coverage ratio of 1.5 to 2.0 as satisfactory. The Debt Service Coverage Ratio can be a very helpful
      metric for assessing a company’s overall financial health, and specifically how capable it is of servicing
      its current debt. The ratio can also assist lenders and investors in determining whether it’s safe for the
      company to take on additional debt financing.

 C. Turnover Ratios
Turnover ratios, also referred to as activity ratios or asset management ratios, measure how efficiently the
assets are employed by a firm. These ratios are based on the relationship between the level of activity,
represented by sales or cost of goods sold, levels of various assets. The important turnover ratios are:
inventory turnover, average collection period, receivables turnover, fixed assets turnover, and total assets
turnover.
1. Inventory Turnover: The inventory turnover, or stock turnover, measures how fast the inventory is moving
   through the firm and generating sales. It is defined as:

                                                  Cost of goods sold
                                                  Average inventory

      Significance: The inventory turnover reflects the efficiency of inventory management. The higher the
      ratio, the more efficient the management of inventories and vice versa. However, this may not always be
      true. A high inventory turnover may be caused by a low level of inventory which may result in frequent
      stock outs and loss of sales and customer goodwill.
      Note that as inventories tend to change over the year, we use the average of the inventories at the
      beginning and the end of the year. In general, averages may be used when a flow figure (such as, cost of
      goods sold) is related to a stock figure (inventories).


      Illustration 7:
      From the following information, calculate inventory turnover ratio :

                                                                                   Rs.
                                Inventory in the beginning =                   18,000
                                Inventory at the end =                        22,000
                                Net purchases =                               46,000
                                Wages =                                        14,000
                                Revenue from operations =                     80,000
                                Carriage inwards =                              4,000

Financial Statement Analysis                                                                              LESSON 8

    Solution:
    Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory
    Cost of Goods Sold = Inventory in the beginning + Net Purchases + Wages + Carriage inwards – Inventory
    at the end = Rs. 18,000 + Rs. 46,000 + Rs. 14,000+ Rs. 4,000 – Rs. 22,000= Rs. 60,000
    Average Inventory = (Inventory in the beginning + Inventory at the end) / 2
    = (Rs. 18,000 + Rs. 22,000) / 2
    = Rs. 20,000
    Inventory Turnover Ratio = Rs. 60,000 / Rs. 20,000 = 3 Times


    Illustration 8:
    From the following information, calculate inventory turnover ratio:
                                                                                   Rs.
                                Revenue from operations =                    4,00,000
                                Average Inventory =                            55,000
                                Gross Profit Ratio =                               10%
    Solution:
    Revenue from operations = Rs. 4,00,000
    Gross Profit = 10% of Rs. 4,00,000 = Rs. 40,000
    Cost of Revenue from operations = Revenue from operations – Gross Profit = Rs. 4,00,000 – Rs. 40,000
    = Rs. 3,60,000
    Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Revenue from Operations / Average Inventory
    = Rs. 3,60,000 / Rs. 55,000 = 6.55 times

2. Debtors’ Turnover This ratio shows how many times sundry debtors (accounts receivable) turn over during
   the year. It is defined as:

                                                 Net credit sales
                                             Average sundry debtors
		If the figure for net credit sales is not available, one may have to make do with the net sales figure. Obviously,
  the higher the debtors’ turnover the greater the efficiency of credit management. Average Collection Period
  The average collection period represents the number of days’ worth of credit sales that is locked in sundry
  debtors. It is defined as:

                                               Average sundry debtors
                                             Average daily credit sales

		The average collection period may be compared with the firm’s credit terms to judge the efficiency of credit
  management. For example, if the credit terms are 2/10, net 45, an average collection period of 85 days
  means that the collection is slow and an average collection period of 40 days means that the collection is
  prompt. An average collection period which is shorter than the credit period allowed by the firm needs to
  be interpreted carefully. It may mean efficiency of credit management or excessive conservatism in credit
  granting that may result in the loss of some desirable sales.

      Calculate the Trade receivables turnover ratio from the following information:

                                                                                                    Rs.
               Total Revenue from operations                                                  4,00,000
               Cash Revenue from operations                        20% of Total Revenue from operations
               Trade receivables as at 1.4.2021                                                 40,000
               Trade receivables as at 31.3.2022                                              1,20,000

      Solution:

      Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio = Net Credit Revenue from Operations / Average Trade Receivables

      Credit Revenue from operations = Total revenue from operations – Cash revenue from operations

      Cash Revenue from operations = 20% of Rs. 4,00,000 = Rs. 80,000

      Credit Revenue from operations = Rs. 4,00,000 – Rs. 80,000 = Rs. 3,20,000

      Average Trade Receivables = (Opening Trade Receivables + Closing Trade Receivables ) / 2 = (Rs. 40,000
      + Rs. 1,20,000) / 2 = Rs. 80,000

      Trade Receivables Turnover Ratios = Net Credit Revenue From Operations / Average Inventory

      Trade Receivables Turnover Ratio = Rs. 3,20,000 / Rs. 80,000 = 4 times.

3. Fixed Assets Turnover This ratio measures sales per rupee of investment in fixed assets. It is defined as:

                                                       Net sales
                                               Average net fixed assets
		This ratio is supposed to measure the efficiency with which fixed assets are employed - a high ratio indicates
  a high degree of efficiency in asset utilisation and a low ratio reflects inefficient use of assets. However, in
  interpreting this ratio, one caution should be borne in mind. When the fixed assets of the firm are old and
  substantially depreciated, the fixed assets turnover ratio tends to be high because the denominator of the
  ratio is very low.
4. Total Assets Turnover: Akin to the output-capital ratio in economic analysis, the total assets turnover is
   defined as:

                                                       Net sales
                                                  Average total assets
		This ratio measures how efficiently assets are employed, overall.

 D. Profitability Ratios
Profitability reflects the final result of business operations. There are two types of profit ability ratios: profit
margin ratios and rate of return ratios. Profit margin ratios show the relationship between profit and sales. Since
profit can be measured at different stages, there are several measures of profit margin. The most popular profit
margin ratios are: gross profit margin, operating profit margin, and net profit margin. Rate of return ratios reflect
the relationship between profit and investment. The important rate of return measures are: return on assets,
earning power, return on capital employed, and return on equity.
1. Gross Profit Margin The gross profit margin ratio is defined as:

                                                    Gross profit
                                               Net sales / Revenue
		Gross profit is defined as the difference between net sales and cost of goods sold.
		 This ratio shows the margin left after meeting manufacturing costs. It measures the efficiency of production
   as well as pricing. To analyse the factors underlying the variation in gross profit margin the proportion
   of various elements of cost (labour, materials, and manufacturing overheads) to sales may be studied in
   detail.

    Significance: It indicates gross margin on products sold. It also indicates the margin available to cover
    operating expenses, non-operating expenses, etc. Change in gross profit ratio may be due to change
    in selling price or cost of revenue from operations or a combination of both. A low ratio may indicate
    unfavourable purchase and sales policy. Higher gross profit ratio is always a good sign.


    Illustration 10:
    Following information is available for the year 2022-23, calculate gross profit margin ratio:
    Revenue from Operations:
             Cash 25,000
             Credit 75,000
    Purchases:
             Cash 15,000
             Credit 60,000
    Carriage Inwards 2,000
    Salaries 25,000
    Decrease in Inventory 10,000
    Return Outwards 2,000
    Wages 5,000
    Solution:
    Revenue from Operations = Cash Revenue from Operations + Credit Revenue from Operation = Rs. 25,000
    + Rs.75,000 = Rs. 1,00,000



                                                                                                                339
EP-CA&FM                                                                              Financial Statement Analysis


      Net Purchases = Cash Purchases + Credit Purchases – Return Outwards = Rs.15,000 + Rs.60,000 –
      Rs.2,000 = Rs. 73,000
      Cost of Revenue from operation = Purchases + (Opening Inventory – Closing Inventory) + Direct Expenses
      = Purchases + Decrease in inventory + Direct Expenses = Rs.73,000 + Rs.10,000 + (Rs.2,000 + Rs.5,000)
      = Rs.90,000
      Gross Profit = Revenue from Operations – Cost of Revenue from Operation = Rs.1,00,000 – Rs.90,000
      = Rs. 10,000
      Gross Profit Ratio = Gross Profit/Net Revenue from Operations ×100 = Rs.10,000/Rs.1,00,000 × 100 = 10%.

2. EBITDA Margin The EBITDA margin is defined as:

                           Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation
                                                        Net sales
		 This ratio shows the margin left after meeting manufacturing expenses, selling, general, and administration
   expenses (SG&A). It reflects the operating efficiency of the firm.

      Illustration 11:

      Given the following information:
      Revenue from Operations                   3,40,000
      Cost of Revenue from Operations            1,20,000
      Selling expenses                            80,000
      Administrative Expenses                     40,000
      Calculate Gross profit ratio and EBITDA margin
      Solution:
      Gross Profit = Revenue from Operations – Cost of Revenue from Operations
      = Rs. 3,40,000 – Rs. 1,20,000 = Rs. 2,20,000
      Gross Profit Ratio = (Gross Profit / Revenue from operation ) x 100
      = (Rs. 2,20,000 / Rs. 3,40,000) x 100
      = 64.71%
      EBITDA Margin = {(Gross Profit - Selling Expenses - Administrative Expenses) / Revenue from operation}
      x 100
      = {(Rs. 2,20,000 - 80,000 - 40,000) / 340000} x 100
      = 29.41%

3. Net Profit Margin The net profit margin ratio is defined as:

                                                     Net profit x 100
                                                        Net sales

Financial Statement Analysis                                                                                LESSON 8

		This ratio shows the earnings left for shareholders (both equity and preference) as a percentage of net sales. It
  measures the overall efficiency of production, administration, selling, financing, pricing, and tax management.
  Jointly considered, the gross and net profit margin ratios provide a valuable understanding of the cost and
  profit structure of the firm and enable the analyst to identify the sources of business efficiency/ inefficiency.

     Illustration 12:
     Gross profit ratio of a company was 25%. Its credit revenue from operations was Rs. 20,00,000 and its
     cash revenue from operations was 10% of the total revenue from operations. If the indirect expenses of
     the company were Rs. 50,000, calculate its net profit ratio.
     Solution:
     Cash Revenue from Operations = Rs.20,00,000 × 10/90 = Rs. 2,22,222
     Hence, total Revenue from Operations are = Rs.22,22,222
     Gross profit = 0.25 × 22,22,222 = Rs. 5,55,555
     Net profit = Rs.5,55,555 – 50,000 = Rs.5,05,555
     Net profit ratio = Net profit/Revenue from Operations × 100
     = Rs.5,05,555/Rs.22,22,222 × 100 = 22.75%

4. Return on Assets The return on assets (ROA) is defined as:

                                                           Profit after tax
                                            ROA =
                                                        Average total assets
		Though widely used, ROA is an odd measure because its numerator measures the return to shareholders
  (equity and preference) whereas its denominator represents the contribution of all investors (shareholders
  as well as lenders).
5. Earning Power The earning power is defined as:

                                                       Profit before interest and tax
                                   Earning power =
                                                           Average total assets
		 Earning power is a measure of business performance which is not affected by interest charges and tax burden.
   It abstracts away the effect of capital structure and tax factor and focuses on operating performance. Hence
   it is eminently suited for inter-firm comparison. Further, it is internally consistent. The numerator represents
   a measure of pre-tax earnings belonging to all sources of finance and the denominator represents total
   financing.
6. Return on Capital Employed The return on capital employed is defined as:

                                          Profit before interest and tax (1 - Tax rate)
                                ROCE =
                                                     Average total assets

		 The numerator of this ratio viz., profit before interest and tax (1 - Tax rate) is also called net operating profit
   after tax (NOPAT).
		 ROCE is the post-tax version of earning power. It considers the effect of taxation, but not the capital structure.
   It is internally consistent. Its merit is that it is defined in such a way that it can be compared directly with the
   post-tax weighted average cost of capital of the firm.



                                                                                                                  341
EP-CA&FM                                                                               Financial Statement Analysis

7. Return on Equity A measure of great interest to equity shareholders, the return on equity (ROE) is defined as:

                                                  Equity earnings
                                                   Average equity

		 The numerator of this ratio is equal to profit after tax less preference dividends. The denominator includes all
   contributions made by equity shareholders (paid-up capital + reserves and surplus). This ratio is also called
   the return on net worth.
		The return on equity measures the profitability of equity funds invested in the firm. Because maximising
  shareholder wealth is the dominant financial objective, ROE is the most important measure of performance
  in an accounting sense. It is influenced by several factors: earning power, debt-equity ratio, average cost of
  debt funds, and tax rate. Because ROA and ROE are commonly used measure, you must remember that they
  are accounting rates of return. Hence these measures may be properly referred to as return on book assets
  and return on book equity.
		In judging all the profitability measures it should be borne in mind that the historical valuation of assets
  imparts an upward bias to profitability measures during an inflationary period. This happens because the
  numerator of these measures represents current values, whereas the denominator represents historical
  values.

 Comparison with Industry Averages
We have discussed a long list of financial ratios. For judging whether the ratios are high or low, one has to
make a comparative analysis such as a cross-section analysis (in which the industry averages may be used as
benchmarks) or time series analysis (in which the ratios of the firm are compared over time.
The table below shows the ratios of ABC Limited along with industry averages. Note that the industry averages
often provide useful benchmarks for comparisons. Sometimes the ratios of few competitor firms may be used
as benchmarks.

 DU PONT ANALYSIS
The du pont analysis is used to measure the company’s financial performance in more detail by showing how
the net profit margin, total asset turnover and equity multiplier to determine the rate of return on equity. In
conducting this du pont system analysis, it can provide information about various factors that cause financial
performance ups and downs in a company. In fact, this method is almost the same as analyzing ordinary
financial statements, but the approach is more integrative by using the composition of financial statements
that are used as elements of its analysis, namely by analyzing financial ratios so that companies can find
out various factors that can affect the effectiveness of the company in managing the resources owned by the
company, so that the company’s financial plan will be better in the future. The purpose of this analysis can be
used to determine the extent of the effectiveness of a company in managing company assets from sales made
by generating profits, so this analysis includes various financial ratios.
To make investing decisions, many a times we want to compare the business models of companies in one
sector to understand if we can explain the differences in valuation and also which company has better financial
metrics.
For example: A Ltd. and B Ltd. have been two big “Made in India” success stories in the FMCG sector. It would
be interesting to compare these two amazing companies. The Market Cap of the two companies are very similar
as the table below shows, the stock market has been recognizing the potential of these companies and the 10
year price returns of these two companies are far higher than that of Hindustan Unilever and the overall market.

                    Company                                Market Cap                   10 Year Return

           A Ltd.                                            Rs. 797 bn                          1958%

           B Ltd.                                            Rs. 769 bn                           854%

           Hindustan Unilever                               Rs. 3449 bn                           539%

           BSE Sensex                                                 –                           190%

After this phenomenal performance over the past few years, interestingly the Current Market Cap of these two
companies is very similar.
Two companies, two different approaches
These two companies with long legacies of more than 120+ years each have taken different paths to achieve
success. A Ltd. describes itself as “One of the Best Ayurvedic Companies in India” whereas B Ltd. calls itself the
“Largest home-grown home and personal care company in India.”
Both have global ambitions
A’s Ltd. products are today available in over 120 countries across the globe. A’s overseas revenue today accounts
for over 30% of the total turnover while B Ltd. is largest household insecticide and hair care players in emerging
markets. In household insecticides, they are the leader in India, the second largest player in Indonesia and are
now expanding our footprint in Africa. They are the leader in hair extensions in Africa, the number one player
in hair colour in India and Sub-Saharan Africa and among the leading players in Latin America. They are the
number one player in air fresheners and wet tissues in Indonesia.

Both Have a Large and Diverse Portfolio
A Ltd. today operates in key consumer product categories like Hair Care, Oral Care, Health Care, Skin Care,
Home Care and Foods. A Ltd. India has portfolio of over 250 Herbal/Ayurvedic products. A’s FMCG portfolio
today includes five flagship brands with distinct brand identities. B Ltd. Consumer’s products include soap, hair
colourants, toiletries and liquid detergents.
How do the Financials of these two companies stack up?
A very interesting tool to compare the business model of two companies in similar businesses is the DuPont
Analysis. The genesis of the analysis was a framework developed by the DuPont Corporation of the USA.
DuPont analysis is great measure of fundamental performance of a company. This analysis decomposes the
key drivers of Return on Equity (ROE). ROE is one of the most important measure of a company’s profitability.




Return on Equity = Net Profit Margin x Asset Turnover Ratio x Financial Leverage
    l   Net Profit Margin = (Net Income / Sales) - The Net Profit Margin signifies the Profit that is extracted per
        rupee of Sales. Everything else remaining same, a company which has a higher Net Profit Margin has
        a higher ROE.
    l   Asset Turnover Ratio = (Sales / Total Assets) - This ratio is an efficiency measurement used to determine
        how effectively a company uses its assets to generate revenue. Higher the Asset Turnover Ratio, higher
        the ROE, everything else remaining the same.
    l   Financial Leverage = (Total Assets / Total Equity) - Financial Leverage measure whether a company
        finances the purchase of assets primarily through debt or equity. The higher the Financial Leverage the
        higher the ROE. Financial Leverage when it becomes excessive can increase the risk of bankruptcy.
So, what does the Dupont Analysis tells us for A Ltd and B Ltd.?

The ROEs of B Ltd. is 3% higher than A Ltd. So one would think that B Ltd. has better Financial metrics. However,
a Deeper look at the Dupont Analysis reveals a different story.
While the Net Profit Margins for the two companies are similar, A Ltd. utilises its assets better than B Ltd. as can
be seen in the Asset Turnover Ratio of A Ltd. at 1.25 vs B Ltd. at 1.02. Also, B Ltd.’s ROE is enhanced by taking a
higher Financial Leverage. So in effect, A Ltd. has better financial metrics than B Ltd.
In general, the Stock Market gives a higher Valuation to a company which has better Financial Metrics. This
analysis was just to highlight the simplicity of Dupont Analysis and its power.

 READING AND INTERPRETATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENT
Financial statement analysis (or financial analysis) is the process of reviewing and analyzing a company’s financial
statements to make better economic decisions to earn income in future. These statements include the income
statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, notes to accounts and a statement of changes in equity (if
applicable). Financial statement analysis is a method or process involving specific techniques for evaluating
risks, performance, financial health, and future prospects of an organization.
It is used by a variety of stakeholders, such as credit and equity investors, the government, the public, and
decision-makers within the organization. These stakeholders have different interests and apply a variety of
different techniques to meet their needs. For example, equity investors are interested in the long-term earnings
power of the organization and perhaps the sustainability and growth of dividend payments. Creditors want to
ensure the interest and principal is paid on the organizations debt securities (e.g., bonds) when due.
There are three major financial statements: the balance sheet, profit-and-loss statement and cash-flow
statement. The balance sheet tells you about the assets and liabilities of a company. The profit-and-loss
statement tells you about a company’s profitability and the cash-flow statement is about the flow of cash into
and out of a company.
Balance sheet: The balance sheet shows the assets that a business owns, the liabilities that it owes and the
funds contributed by its shareholders.
Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ equity.
Assets include land, equipment, inventory, goodwill, patents, brand value, etc. Liabilities include debt (long-
term and short-term) and any other payables that a business has. Shareholder funds are in the form of equity
and reserves.
A weak balance sheet is one that is saddled with debt. When a business has a strong balance sheet, it has more
assets and equity than liabilities. In order to know the balance-sheet strength, can look at the debt-equity ratio.
Profit and loss Statement: As its name suggests, the P&L statement tells about the profitability of a company.
The simple formula to calculate profits is Profit (loss) = Revenue - Expenses.

Financial Statement Analysis                                                                              LESSON 8

The head ‘revenue’ generally has two entries: revenue from sales and other income. Other income is the
revenue from sources other than the core area of the company’s operations. For instance, it could be income
from investments, dividends, royalties, etc.
The head ‘expenses’ constitutes the categories of expenditure such as cost of raw materials, employee costs,
etc. On subtracting the total costs from the total revenues, we get the ‘operating profit’, which is nothing but a
company’s profit from its core operations.
In order to arrive at the final profit figure, any miscellaneous income or loss is to be added to or subtracted from
the operating profit. Finally, net profit is obtained after deducting the tax applicable.

Cash-flow statement
The cash-flow statement shows the movement of cash in a business. While businesses can misstate their profits
through accounting jugglery, they can’t fudge the movement of cash. Hence, a cash-flow statement provides a
true picture of a company’s financial health. However, for banks and finance companies, the cash-flow statement
is of limited use as they follow a different business model than other types of businesses.
The cash-flow statement has three components: cash flows from operating activities, from financing activities
and from investing activities. The statement also mentions the current cash holding of the business.
What need to check in the data is whether flows from operating activities are positive or not. If they are positive,
it means that the company is able to generate cash from its operations. If they are negative, it means that the
company is losing money. While it may show profits in its P&L statement, negative flows from operations should
ring an alarm.
Cash flows from financing activities show the money raised for the company’s operations or the money paid
towards debt repayment. The former will be a positive number on the statement, while the latter will be a
negative number.
Cash flows from investing activities capture the cash used in investments. For instance, a business that has
generated surplus cash may park it in a bank fixed deposit. Next year it may withdraw cash from that FD. The
former will be a negative number on the statement, while the latter will be a positive number.
The balance sheet, profit-and-loss statement, as well as the cash-flow statement contain the data necessary to
guide investors looking to invest in a company. Ratios used in analysing stocks also require figures and data
contained in these statements, without which a thorough analysis is impossible. All these statements may be
found in the annual reports of companies.
Common methods of financial statement analysis include fundamental analysis, DuPont analysis, and the use
of financial ratios. Historical information combined with a series of assumptions and adjustments to the financial
information may be used to project future performance.

Analysis of Auditors Report and Opinion
The objective of the reporting phase of a financial audit is to present an informed opinion about a business’s
financial statements, including whether they conform to generally accepted accounting principles. Even though
the report contains only three sections, the impact it can have on the future of a business makes being able to
read and understand its contents crucial.
A financial audit report is the final step of an external financial audit. After planning the audit and gathering
necessary information, an auditor then must interpret results. Although the information an auditor collects
through inquiry, observation, inspection, calculations, comparisons and analysis is “fact,” the report itself
expresses the opinion of the auditor.


                                                                                                                347
EP-CA&FM                                                                                   Financial Statement Analysis

The introductory section identifies the responsibilities of the company director and the independent auditor.
Regardless of how large the company or financial accounting department, the auditor holds the company
director responsible for accounting policies, the preparation of financial documents, internal business controls
designed to ensure the financial documents are honest and correct and the presentation of financial statements
to the auditor. The auditor takes responsibility for expressing an opinion based only on the facts and for
complying with ethical and legal auditing guidelines during the planning and information-gathering stages of
the financial audit.
Scope of the audit -- the area it covers -- is the second and shortest section. It provides a description of what the
auditor has done and includes a blanket statement -- a statement common to and for the most part identical in
every audit report -- that specifically states the auditor has examined the financial statements of the business
in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and has performed appropriate tests to make a
reasonable assessment of the business’s financial processes, internal controls and documents.

Auditor’s Opinion
The auditor’s opinion is the most important section of the audit report. Here the auditor sums up findings by
expressing one of three generally accepted opinions or includes a disclaimer, which means the auditor refuses
to give an opinion, most often because the business either can’t or won’t produce the appropriate documents or
information. The most favorable opinion is an unqualified opinion, meaning the company director provided all
the necessary financial documents and everything was in order and met all auditing requirements. A qualified
opinion means that while the majority of documents were in order, the auditor did find one or two exceptions. An
adverse opinion is an opinion no business wants; this negative opinion says the business financial records are
inaccurate, incomplete or not in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Analysis of Management Judgement
Management Personal judgement plays a vital role in the preparation of financial records and financial
statements. The management may use their judgement in choosing the method of valuation of closing inventory,
in calculating the provision for bad debts and in choosing the method of charging the depreciation of fixed
assets. Likewise, the application of various accounting concepts and conventions depends upon the personal
judgement of the management. Therefore, different meaning and results can be obtained from the financial
statements of the same company. Based on the different results, different recommendations may be provided
for the growth and development of a business concern.

 Problems in Financial Statement Analysis
Lack of an Underlying Theory The basic problem in financial statement analysis is that there is no theory
that tells us which numbers to look at and how to interpret them. In the absence of an underlying theory
financial statement analysis appears to be ad hoc, informal, and subjective. As Horrigan put it: “From a negative
viewpoint, the most striking aspect of ratio analysis is the absence of an explicit theoretical structure. As a result
the subject of ratio analysis is replete with untested assertions about which ratios should be used and what their
proper levels should be.”
Conglomerate Firms Many firms, particularly the large ones, have operations spanning a wide range of
industries. Given the diversity of their product lines, it is difficult to find suitable benchmarks for evaluating their
financial performance and condition. Hence, it appears that meaningful benchmarks may be available only for
firms which have a well-defined industry classification.
Window Dressing Firms may resort to window dressing to project a favourable financial picture. For example, a
firm may prepare its balance sheet at a point when its inventory level is very low. As a result, it may appear that
the firm has a very comfortable liquidity position and a high turnover of inventories. When window dressing of

348
Financial Statement Analysis                                                                              LESSON 8

this kind is suspected, the financial analyst should look at the average level of inventory over a period of time
and not the level of inventory at just one point of time.
Price Level Changes Financial accounting, as it is currently practised in India and most other countries, does not
take into account price level changes. As a result, balance sheet figures are distorted and profits misreported.
Hence, financial statement analysis can be vitiated.
Variations in Accounting Policies Business firms have some latitude in the accounting treatment of items
like depreciation, valuation of stocks, research and development expenses, foreign exchange transactions,
installment sales, preliminary and pre-operative expenses, provision of reserves, and revaluation of assets.
Due to diversity of accounting policies found in practice, comparative financial statement analysis may be
vitiated.
Interpretation of Results Though industry averages and other yardsticks are commonly used in financial ratios,
it is somewhat difficult to judge whether a certain ratio is ‘good’ or ‘bad’. A high current ratio, for example, may
indicate a strong liquidity position (something good) or excessive inventories (something bad). Likewise, a high
turnover of fixed assets may mean efficient utilisation of plant and machinery or continued flogging of more or
less fully depreciated, worn out, and inefficient plant and machinery.
Another problem in interpretation arises when a firm has some favourable ratios and some unfavourable ratios
and this is rather common. In such a situation, it may be somewhat difficult to form an overall judgment about
its financial strength or weakness. Multiple discriminate analysis, a statistical tool, may be employed to sort out
the net effect of several ratios pointing in different directions.
Correlation among Ratios Notwithstanding the previous observation, financial ratios of a firm often show a high
degree of correlation. Why? This is because several ratios have some common element (sales, for example, is
used in various turnover ratios) and several items tend to move in harmony because of some common underlying
factor. In view of ratio correlations, it is redundant and often confusing to employ a large number of ratios in
financial statement analysis. Hence it is necessary to choose a small group of ratios from a large set of ratios.
Such a selection requires a good understanding of the meaning and limitations of various ratios and an insight
into the economics of the business.

 Guidelines for Financial Statement Analysis
From the foregoing discussion, it is clear that financial statement analysis cannot be treated as a simple,
structured exercise. The following point to be taken into consideration while analyse financial statements.
    1.   Use ratios to get clues to ask the right questions: By themselves ratios rarely provide answers, but
         they definitely help to raise the right questions.
   2.    Be selective in the choice of ratios: Compute scores of different ratios and easily drown into confusion.
         For most purposes a small set of ratios-three to seven-would suffice. Few ratios, aptly chosen, would
         capture most of the information that can derive from financial statements.
   3.    Employ proper benchmarks: It is a common practice to compare the ratios (calculated from a set of
         financial statements) against some benchmarks. These bench marks may be the average ratios of the
         industry or the ratios of the industry leaders or the historic ratios of the firm itself.
   4.    Know the tricks used by accountants: Since firms tend to manipulate the reported income, should
         learn about the devices employed by them.
   5.    Read the footnotes: Footnotes sometimes contain valuable information. They may reveal things that
         management may try to hide. The more difficult it is to read a footnote, the more information-laden it
         may be.


                                                                                                                349
EP-CA&FM                                                                                   Financial Statement Analysis

   6.      Remember that financial statement analysis is an odd mixture of art and science: Financial
           statement analysis cannot be regarded as a simple, structured exercise. It is a process requiring
           care, thought, common sense, and business judgment-a process for which there are no mechanical
           substitutes.

 Going Beyond the Numbers
The tools of analysis discussed in this chapter are helpful in making business decisions, evaluating performance,
and forecasting future developments. Comprehensive business analysis, however, calls for going beyond the
conventional financial measures to consider qualitative factors relevant for evaluating the performance and
prospects of a company. The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) has summarised these factors
as follows:
      1.   Are the company’s revenues tied to one key customer? If so, the company’s performance may decline
           dramatically if the customer goes elsewhere. On the other hand, if the relationship is firmly entrenched,
           this might actually stabilise sales.
   2.      To what extent are the company’s revenues tied to one key product? Companies that rely on a single
           product may be more efficient and focused, but a lack of diversification increases risk. If revenues come
           from several different products, the overall bottom line will be less affected by a drop in the demand for
           any one product.
   3.      To what extent does the company rely on a single supplier? Depending on a single supplier may lead
           to unanticipated shortages, which investors and potential creditors should consider.
   4.      What percentage of the company’s business is generated overseas? Companies with a large percentage
           of overseas business are often able to realise higher growth and larger profit margins. However, firms
           with large overseas operations find that the value of their operations depends in large part on the value
           of the local currency. Thus, fluctuations in currency markets create additional risks for firms with large
           overseas operations. Also, the potential stability of the region is important.
   5.      Competition. Generally, increased competition lowers prices and profit margins. In forecasting future
           performance, it is important to assess both the likely actions of the current competition and the likelihood
           of new competitors in the future.
   6.      Future prospects. Does the company invest heavily in research and development? If so, its future
           prospects may depend critically on the success of new products in the pipe line. For example, the
           market’s assessment of a computer company depends on how next year’s products are shaping up.
           Likewise, investors in pharmaceutical companies are interested in knowing whether the company has
           developed any potential blockbuster drugs that are doing well in the required tests.
      7.   Legal and regulatory environment. Changes in laws and regulations have important implications for
           many industries. For example, when forecasting the future of tobacco companies, it is crucial to factor
           in the effects of proposed regulations and pending or likely lawsuits. Likewise, when assessing banks,
           telecommunications firms, and electric utilities, analysts need to forecast both the extent to which these
           industries will be regulated in the years ahead, and the ability of individual firms to respond to changes
           in regulation.

     l     Ratio Analysis: An important tool of financial statement analysis is ratio analysis. Accounting ratios
           represent relationship between two accounting numbers.
     l     Objective of Ratio Analysis: The objective of ratio analysis is to provide a deeper analysis of the
           profitability, liquidity, solvency and activity levels in the business. It is also to identify the problem
           areas as well as the strong areas of the business.
     l     Advantages of Ratio Analysis: Ratio analysis offers many advantages including enabling financial
           statement analysis, helping understand efficacy of decisions, simplifying complex figures and
           establish relationships, being helpful in comparative analysis, identification of problem areas,
           enables SWOT analysis, and allows various comparisons.
     l     Types of Ratios: There are many types of ratios, viz., liquidity, solvency, activity and profitability
           ratios. The liquidity ratios include current ratio and acid test ratio. Solvency ratios are calculated to
           determine the ability of the business to service its debt in the long run instead of in the short run.
           They include debt equity ratio, total assets to debt ratio etc.
     l     Dupont Analysis: DuPont analysis is a useful technique used to decompose the different drivers of
           return on equity. An investor can use analysis tools like this to compare the operational efficiency of
           two similar firms. Managers can use DuPont analysis to identify strengths or weaknesses that should
           be addressed.

 INTRODUCTION
Cash flow statement, which shows inflows and outflows of the cash and cash equivalents. This statement is
usually prepared by companies which come as a tool in the hands of users of financial information to know
about the sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents of an enterprise over a period of time from various
activities of an enterprise. It has gained substantial importance in the last decade because of its practical utility
to the users of financial information.
This statement reports a net cash inflow or net cash outflow for each activity and for the overall business. It also
reports from where cash has come and how it has been spent. It explains the causes for the changes in the cash
balance. In substance, the cash flow statement summarises a myriad of specific cash transactions into a few
categories for a business entity. The statement of cash flows reports the cash receipts, cash payments, and net
changes in cash resulting from operating, investing and financing activities of an enterprise during a period in a
format that reconciles the beginning and ending cash balances.

Applicability
The applicability of Cash flow statement has been defined under the Companies Act, 2013. As per the definition
in the act, a financial statement includes the following:
      i.    Balance sheet
      ii.   Profit and loss account / Income and expenditure account
   iii.     Cash flow statement
   iv.      Statement of changes in equity
      v.    Explanatory notes
Financial Statements are defined in Companies Act, 2013 (Section 2 (40)] and includes Cash Flow Statement
prepared in accordance with Accounting Standard- 3 (AS-3) i.e. Cash Flow Statement.

  As per AS 3:
  For Companies - As per the Companies Act, 2013, Cash Flow Statement is required to be prepared by
  every company except a one person, small and dormant company.
  For non-companies - AS 3 is not mandatory for entities falling in Level II and Level III.


 UTILITY OF CASH FLOW ANALYSIS
A Cash flow statement shows inflow and outflow of cash and cash equivalents from various activities of a
company during a specific period. The primary objective of cash flow statement is to provide useful information
about cash flows (inflows and outflows) of an enterprise during a particular period under various heads, i.e.,
operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. This information is useful in providing users of
financial statements with a basis to assess the ability of the enterprise to generate cash and cash equivalents
and the needs of the enterprise to utilise those cash flows. The economic decisions that are taken by users
require an evaluation of the ability of an enterprise to generate cash and cash equivalents and the timing and
certainty of their generation.
A cash flow statement is useful for short-term planning. A business enterprise needs sufficient cash to meet its
various obligations in the near future such as payment for purchase of fixed assets, payment of debts maturing

Cash Flows                                                                                                LESSON 9

in the near future, expenses of the business, etc. A historical analysis of the different sources and applications
of cash will enable the management to make reliable cash flow projections for the immediate future. It may then
plan out for investment of surplus to meet the deficit, if any. Thus, a cash flow analysis is an important financial
tool for the management. Its chief advantages are as follows:

         1. Helps in efficient cash management: Cash flow analysis helps in evaluating financial
            policies and cash position. Cash is the basis for all operations; hence a projected cash flow
            statement will enable the management to plan and coordinate the financial operations
            properly. The management can know how much cash is needed, from which source it will
            be derived, how much can be generated internally and how much could be obtained from
            outside.

        2. Helps in internal financial management: Cash flow analysis provides information about
           funds which will be available from operations. This will help the management in determining
           policies regarding internal financial management, e.g., possibility of repayment of long-term
           debts, dividend policies and planning the replacement of plant and machinery.

        3. Discloses the movements of cash: Cash flow statement discloses the complete story of
           cash movement. The increase or decrease in cash, and the reasons therefore can be
           known. It discloses the reasons for low cash balance in spite of heavy operating profits
           or for heavy cash balance in spite of low profits. However, comparison of original forecast
           with the actual results highlights the trends of movements of cash which may otherwise go
           undetected.

        4. Discloses success or failure of cash planning: The extent of success or failure of cash
           planning can be known by comparing the projected cash flow statement with the actual
           cash flow statement so that necessary remedial measures can be taken.

        5. Evaluate management decisions: The statement of cash flows reports the companies’
           investing and financing activities and thus gives the investors and creditors about cash flow
           information for evaluating managers’ decisions.

        6. Show the relationship of net income to changes in the business cash: Usually cash and
           net income move together. High levels of income tend to lead to increase in cash and vice-
           versa. However, a company’s cash balance can decrease when its net income is high, and
           cash can increase when income is low. The users want to know the difference between the
           net profit and net cash provided by operations. The net profit shows the progress of the
           business during the year while cash flow relates more to the liquidity of the business. The
           users can assess the reliability of net profit with the help of cash flow statement.

         7. Efficiency in cash management: Cash flow analysis helps in evaluating financial policies
            and cash position. It facilitates the management to plan and co-ordinate the financial
            operations properly. The management can estimate how much funds are needed, from
            which source they will be derived, how much can be generated internally and how much
            should be arranged from outside.

Financing activities are         (a) cash proceeds from issuing shares or other similar instruments;
activities that result in
                                 (b) cash proceeds from issuing debentures, loans notes, bonds and other
changes in the size and
                                     short term borrowing;
composition of the owners’
capital (including preference    (c) cash repayments of amounts borrowed i.e. redemption of debentures,
share capital in the case of a       bonds etc.;
company) and borrowings of       (d) cash payments to redeem preference shares;
the enterprise
                                 (e) payment of dividend.

Treatment of Some Peculiar Items

    Foreign       Cash flows arising from transactions in a foreign currency should be recorded in an
   Currency       enterprise’s reporting currency by applying to the foreign currency amount the exchange
  Cash Flows      rate between the reporting currency and foreign currency at the date of cash flow. A
                  rate that approximates actual rate may be used if the result is substantially the same as
                  would arise if the rates at the date of cash flows were used. Unrealised gains and losses
                  arising from changes in foreign exchange rates are not cash flows. However, the effect of
                  exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents held or due in foreign currency is
                  reported in the cash flow statement in order to reconcile cash and cash equivalents at
                  the beginning and the end of the period. This amountis presented separately from cash
                  flows from operating, investing and financing activities and includes the differences, if any,
                  had those cash flows been reported at the end of period exchange rates.

                                           Reporting of foreign currency cash flows

                    of the enterprise using the exchange        reconciliation of the changes in cash and
                    rate on the date of cash flow               cash equivalents during the Period

 Extraordinary    Extraordinary items are not the regular phenomenon, e.g., loss due to theft or earthquake
     Items        or flood. Extraordinary items are non-recurring in nature and hence cash flows associated
                  with extraordinary items should be classified and disclosed separately as arising from
                  operating, investing or financing activities. This is done to enable users to understand their
                  nature and effect on the present and future cash flows of an enterprise.

  Interest and    According to Accounting Standard-3 (Revised), the treatment of interest and dividends,
    Dividend      received and paid, depends upon the nature of the enterprise, that is, financial enterprises
                  and other enterprises.
                    l In the case of financial enterprises: Cash flows arising from interest paid, interest
                        received and dividends received, should be classified as cash flows from operating
                        activities. While dividend paid is a financing activities.

                  l In the case of other enterprises: Cash flows arising from interest paid should be
                      classified as cash flows from financing activities. Cash flows arising from interest

    Taxes on     Taxes may be income tax (tax on normal profit), capital gains tax (tax on capital profits),
  Income and     dividend tax (tax on the amount distributed as dividend to shareholders). Cash flows arising
     Gains       from taxes on income should be separately disclosed and should be classified as cash
                 flows from operating activities unless they can be specifically identified with financing and
                 investing activities. This clearly implies that:
                  l tax on operating profit should be classified as operating cash flows.

                  l dividend tax, i.e., tax paid on dividend should be classified as financing activity along
                      with dividend paid.
                  l Capital gains tax paid on sale of fixed assets should be classified under investing
                      activities.

    Non-cash     Investing and financing transactions that do not require the use of cash or cash equivalents
  Transactions   should be excluded from a cash flow statement. Examples of such transactions are
                 – acquisition of machinery by issue of equity shares or redemption of debentures by
                 issue of equity shares. Such transactions should be disclosed elsewhere in the financial
                 statements in a way that provide all the relevant information about these investing and
                 financing activities. Hence, assets acquired by issue of shares are not disclosed in cash
                 flow statement due to non-cash nature of the transaction.

 A. Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Operating activities are the main source of revenue and expenditure in an enterprise. Therefore, the
ascertainment of cash flows from operating activities need special attention. An enterprise should report cash
flows from operating activities either by using following method:




 Direct Method
Under direct method, cash receipts from operating revenues and cash payments for operating expenses
are arranged and presented in the cash flow statement. The difference between cash receipts and cash
payments is the net cash flow from operating activities. It is in effect a cash basis Statement of Profit &
Loss. In this case each cash transaction is analysed separately and the total cash receipts and payments
for the period is determined. The summarised data for revenue and expenses can be obtained from the
financial statements and additional information. We may convert accrual basis of revenue and expenses
to equivalent cash receipts and payments. Make sure that a uniform procedure is adopted for converting
accrual base items to cash base items.

Cash Flows                                                                                          LESSON 9

The following are some examples of usual cash receipts and cash payments resulting from operating activities:




Some of the items to be shown in the cash flow statement are illustrated below:
Collections from Customers: If a business has only cash sales, the amount of sales revenue in the income
statement is the amount of cash collected from the customers. However, when the business has credit sales we
have to adjust the amount of sales revenue for changes in debtors and bills receivable. The opening balance of
debtors or bills receivable represents uncollected amount from a previous period and it is presumed that cash
has been collected during the current accounting period. The closing balance of debtors or bills receivable
represents uncollected amount in the current accounting period. Therefore in order to calculate the cash
received from debtors, the opening balance (debtors/bills receivable) should be added to the amount of credit
sales and closing balance should be subtracted therefrom.
Alternatively, Cash Collected from Debtors can also be calculated as given below:

                         Cash Collected from Debtors = Credit Sales + Decrease in
                         Accounts Receivable or - Increase in Accounts Receivable.

Payment to Suppliers: The analysis of cash payments to suppliers begins with cost of goods sold from the
Statement of Profit & Loss. The amount of purchases is calculated by adding closing stock and subtracting
opening stock form the cost of goods sold. The cash payment made to suppliers is calculated by making
adjustments for change in sundry creditors/bills payable.

                         Purchases = Cost of Goods Sold + Closing Stock - Opening
                                                  Stock
                                                     OR
                           Purchases = Cost of Goods Sold + Increase in Stock or -
                                             Decrease in Stock




                                                                                                          363
EP-CA&FM                                                                                             Cash Flows


                          Cash Paid to Suppliers = Purchases + Opening Balance of
                         Creditors (Bills Payable) - Closing Balance of Creditors (Bills
                                                    Payable).
                                                      OR
                         Cash Paid to Suppliers = Purchases + Decrease in Accounts
                                Payable or - Increase in Accounts Payable.

Payment to Employees:

                           Cash Paid for Wages and Salaries = Wages and Salaries
                           Expenses + Opening Balance of Outstanding Wages and
                        Salaries - Closing Balance of Outstanding Wages and Salaries.
                                                      OR
                           Cash Paid for Wages and Salaries = Wages and Salaries
                           Expenses + Decrease in Wages and Salaries Payable or -
                                  Increase in Wages and Salaries Payable.

Rent Received: The analysis of rent received is similar to cash collected from customers.

                          Rent Received = Rent Revenue + Opening Balance of Rent
                              Receivable - Closing Balance of Rent Receivable.
                                                      OR
                        Rent Received = Rent Revenue + Decrease in Rent Receivable
                                      or - Increase in Rent Receivable.

Interest Paid: The analysis of interest paid is similar to the analysis of payments to employees.

                           Interest Paid = Interest Expenses + Opening Balance of
                        Outstanding Interest - Closing Balance of Outstanding Interest.
                                                      OR
                            Interest Paid = Interest Expenses + Decrease in Interest
                                   Payable, or - Increase in Interest Payable.

A similar treatment is applied for various other income and expenses to find out the cash inflows or outflows.
Insurance: Different procedure is adopted for insurance expense because insurance is usually purchased (and
recorded as an asset) before it becomes an expense. The treatment is as follows:

                           Cash Paid for Insurance = Insurance Expenses + Closing
                            Balance of Unexpired Insurance - Opening Balance of
                                            Unexpired Insurance.
                                                      OR
                         Cash Paid for Insurance = Insurance Expenses + Increase in
                         Unexpired Insurance or - Decrease in Unexpired Insurance.

Cash Flows                                                                                               LESSON 9

A similar treatment is applied for other prepaid expenses also.
In direct method of calculating cash flow from operations, the following points should be noted:
   (i)    The necessary adjustments should be made for bad debts, sales returns, purchases returns, discount
          allowed, discount received etc. while calculating the amount received from the customers or paid to
          suppliers, as the case may be.
   (ii)   Items like depreciation, amortisation of intangible assets (such as goodwill, patent, trade mark etc.) or
          of debenture discount, preliminary expenses, premium on redemption of debentures and preference
          shares are ignored from the cash flow statement since the method analyses and includes only cash
          transactions and therefore, non-cash items are omitted from a statement of cash flows.
  (iii)   No adjustment is made for loss or gain on the sale of fixed assets and investments since operating cash
          receipts and payments are reported directly on the cash flow statement.

 Indirect Method
Indirect method of ascertaining cash flow from operating activities begins with the amount of net profit/loss. This
is so because statement of profit and loss incorporates the effects of all operating activities of an enterprise.
However, Statement of Profit and Loss is prepared on accrual basis (and not on cash basis). Moreover, it also
includes certain non-operating items such as interest paid, profit/loss on sale of fixed assets, etc.) and non-cash
items (such as depreciation, goodwill written-off, dividend declared, etc. Therefore, it becomes necessary to
adjust the amount of net profit/loss as shown by Statement of Profit and Loss for arriving at cash flows from
operating activities.
A summary of adjustments required to convert the net profit to net cash flow from operating activities
through indirect method is as follows:

                                           Particulars                                             Amount (Rs.)
  A. Net profit before tax and extraordinary item
  B. Adjustments for non-cash and non-operating items:
 		Add: Amount written off in respect of depreciation, goodwill, preliminary expenses,
   underwriting commission etc.
 		Add/Less: Other non-operating items
  C. Adjustment for gains and losses on sale of fixed assets and investments:
 		Add: Loss on sale of fixed assets/investments Less: Profit on sale of fixed assets/
   investments
  D. Adjustments for changes in current assets (except cash and cash equivalents) and
     current liabilities (except bank overdraft)
 		Add: Decrease in accounts of current assets e.g. debtors, bill receivable, stock,
   prepaid expenses etc. Less: Increase in accounts of current assets.
 		Add: Increase in accounts of current liabilities; e.g., creditors, bills payable, outstanding
   expenses, etc.
 		Less: Decrease in accounts of current liabilities.
   E. Cash generated from operations
 		Less: Income tax paid.
   F. Adjustments for extra-ordinary items if any
  G. Net cash from (used in) operating activities


                                                                                                               365
EP-CA&FM                                                                                                  Cash Flows

Note: The computation of net cash inflow or cash outflow from operating activities by the indirect method
takes a path that is very different from the computation by the direct method. However, the two methods
arrive at the same amount of net cash flow from operations.
The logic behind the treatment of various items are explained as follows:

   1.   Adjustment for Depreciation and other Non-cash and Non-operating items
        Depreciation, depletion and amortisation of expenses (amortisation of goodwill, preliminary expenses,
        premium on redemption of debentures, underwriting commission, etc.) do not affect cash and thus
        should be added back to the net profit in the cash flow statement. When depreciation is provided
        it has no effect on cash. However, depreciation is deducted from revenues for the computation of
        income. Therefore, in going from net profit to cash flow from operations, we add depreciation back
        to net profit. Likewise, all expenses with no cash effects are added back to net profit in the cash flow
        statement. In the same manner, revenues that do not provide cash inflow are subtracted from net
        profit.

  2.    Adjustment for Gains and Losses on Sale of Fixed Assets/Investments
        When fixed assets or investments are sold, there may be either profit or loss on sale. Such profit or
        loss affects the amount of net profit.
        For instance, when fixed assets, with a book value of Rs. 75,000 was sold for Rs. 90,000, the actual
        inflow of cash is Rs. 90,000 which would be reflected in the cash flow statement including a profit
        of Rs. 15,000. But this profit on sale of fixed asset has already increased the net profit indicating an
        inflow of cash from operating activities. In order to avoid this duplication, this profit of Rs. 15,000 must
        be deducted from the net profit. Moreover sale of fixed assets is an investing activity and therefore
        effect of this profit on sale must be removed from cash flow from operations. Likewise, a loss on
        sale of fixed assets or investment also require an adjustment to the net profit in the cash flow from
        operations. This loss is added back to the net profit to compute cash flow from operations.

   3.   Changes in Current Assets and Liabilities
        Most current assets and current liabilities result from operating activities. Sundry debtors and bills
        receivable result from sales, inventory generates revenues and prepaid expenses are used in
        operations. On the liabilities side sundry creditors and bills payable are ordinarily incurred to buy
        inventory and outstanding liabilities relate to salaries, utilities and other expenses. Changes in these
        current assets and liabilities are reported as adjustments to net profit on the cash flows statement.
        The following rules apply:
         (a) An increase in current assets other than cash is deducted from net profit to calculate cash flow
             from operations:
        		 For example, when sundry debtors (net) increase during the year, this means that revenues on
           accrual basis are higher than revenues on cash basis since goods sold on credit are treated
           as revenues on accrual basis. In other words, the business operations in the period covered
           resulted in more revenues but not all these revenues resulted in corresponding increase in cash.
           Some of the revenues resulted in an increase in debtors only. In order to convert the net profit
           to net cash provided by operating activities the increase in debtors must be deducted from the
           reported net profit. However, a decrease in current assets has opposite effect and has to be
           added back to net profit to determine cash provided for the period.
         (b) An increase in current liability is added to net profit to arrive at the cash from operation.

        		For example, when sundry creditors increase during the period covered, it means that expenses
          on accrual basis are more than they are on cash basis because expenses are incurred for
          which no payment has been made. So this increase must be added to net profit. However, a
          decrease in a current liability is subtracted from net profit since more cash has been paid than
          the expenses recorded on accrual basis.

 B & C - CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES
The details of item leading inflows and outflows from investing and financing activities have already been
outlined. While preparing the cash flow statement, all major items of gross cash receipts, gross cash payments,
and net cash flows from investing and financing activities must be shown separately under the headings ‘Cash

 LIMITATIONS OF CASH FLOW ANALYSIS
Cash flow analysis is a useful tool of financial analysis. However, it has its own limitations. These limitations are
as under:
    1.   Cash flow statement cannot be equated with the income statement. An income statement takes into
         account both cash as well as non-cash items; therefore, net cash does not necessarily mean net income
         of the business.
   2.    The cash balance as disclosed by the cash flow statement may not represent the real liquid position of
         the business since it can be easily influenced by postponing purchases and other payments.
   3.    Cash flow statement cannot replace the income statement or the funds flow statement. Each of them
         has a separate function to perform.
In spite of these limitations it can be said that cash flow statement is a useful supplementary instrument. It
discloses the volume as well as the speed at which the cash flows in the different segments of the business.
This helps the management in knowing the amount of capital tied up in a particular segment of the business.
The technique of cash flow analysis, when used in conjunction with ratio analysis, serves as a barometer in
measuring the profitability and financial position of the business.

 HOW TO INTERPRET A CASH FLOW STATEMENT
Whenever review any financial statement, we should consider it from a business perspective. Financial
documents are designed to provide insight into the financial health and status of an organization.
For example, cash flow statements can reveal what phase a business is in: whether it’s a rapidly growing
startup or a mature and profitable company. It can also reveal whether a company is going through transition
or in a state of decline.
Using this information, an investor might decide that a company with uneven cash flow is too risky to invest in;
or they might decide that a company with positive cash flow is primed for growth. Similarly, a department head
might look at a cash flow statement to understand how their particular department is contributing to the health
and wellbeing of the company and use that insight to adjust their department’s activities. Cash flow might also
impact internal decisions, such as budgeting, or the decision to hire (or fire) employees.

                                                                                                                381

Cash flow is typically depicted as being positive (the business is taking in more cash than it’s expending) or
negative (the business is spending more cash than it’s receiving).

IronMount and Bronze Medal, both companies, have the same end-of-the-year cash of 365,900. Additionally,
changes in cash during the year are the same at 315,900. Which company is displaying elements of cash flow
stress?
Solution: We note that Cash Flow from Operations is negative for IronMount at -21,450. Gain on equipment
sales is deducted as this is not an operating cash flow. IronMount sale of equipment adds 307,350, contributing
to the cash increase.
On the other hand, when we look at BronzeMetal, we note that its cash flow from operations is strong at
374,250 and seems to be doing great in its business. They are not relying on the one-time sale of equipment
to generate cash flows.
With this, we conclude that IronMount is showing signs of stress due to low core operating income and its
reliance on other one-time items to generate cash.

 INTRODUCTION
The financial health and performance of entities shall be a matter of great concern for every stakeholder
especially for government, regulators and investors reason being the scale and degree of illegal and unethical
corporate practices which traumatize the entire world’s business. Corporate scandals and failures in several
corporations like Enron, WorldCom, and Arthur Andersen and Satyam scam (often termed as ‘India’s Enron’)
that raises debates whether entities should issue or use new-fangled perspectives to measure firm performance
to maximize shareholders’ wealth. The measurement of the financial health of an entity with the help of
financial statements provides a qualitative analysis of the entities’ position along with how the entities have
effectively employed its capital in production. Similar view has been found in the research of Bhunia et al.
(2011) that quantitative financial performance analysis through reported results in financial statements would
be an indication of effectiveness and efficiency of resources utilization by management. Financial analysis
encompasses the use of quantitative information from financial statements in order to establish relationships of
the items that are reported by the company according to the accounting standards. By doing this, the entity is
able to evaluate “Heart of Business Entity”. It gauges the financial health of a potential investment. It provides
detailed information about Strength and weakness of entity, Quality of Profit, Quality of Incomes and Revenues
to its stakeholders.
According to section 2(40) of Companies Act, 2013 defines “financial statement” in relation to a company,
includes a balance sheet as at the end of the financial year, a profit and loss account, or in the case of a
company carrying on any activity not for profit, an income and expenditure account for the financial year, cash
flow statement for the financial year, a statement of changes in equity, if applicable; and any explanatory note
annexed to, or forming part of, any document.
However, every action or inaction of entities / corporate is perceptible from financial statements. Hence, it got
practical reliance since Kautilya’s time Arthashastra which was written about 2400 years ago. In reality, there
has been immense pressure on management to consistently report promising and favorable results of entities
which does not reflect economic reality. Similar view has been found in research of Kneer, Reckers & Jennings
(1996) that entities have to report flattering results due to management pressure and further suggested that rosy
picture of financial statements mostly keep shareholders satisfied with smooth income flows and consistent
growth. Albrecht, Wernz & Williams (1995) opined strong financial pressure acted as typical incentives for
management fraud and perceiving opportunity to commit and conceal a fraud.

statements are considered as an open source of information as per legislation and their composition, disclosure
and presentation structure would be unified by basic parameters. In fact, it provides basis for decision making
and reflect the cumulative effects of all management’s past decisions for different stakeholders. In nutshell,
the purpose of financial statement is to facilitate the possibility of Multiple-Criteria Decision Analysis and to
evaluate the effectiveness of the performance of entities.
Korableva and Kalimullina (2014) have observed in their research that timely and high-quality financial
statements provide a universal picture of a legal entity’s performance, effectiveness, financial stability and
health. In fact, it diagnoses the causes of deviations from the previously established indicators and expose
the idle resources of production. The essence of financial statements’ analysis from the position of a user is
to assess and evaluate most significant characteristics of entities which testify, in particular, about its success
or the risk of bankruptcy. The analysis of financial statements depends on a specific goal for different users
subject to the scale of its implementation and hence the analysis and direction of work can be different and
useful for different interested stakeholders. Before we understand and learn about financial forecasting, it is
very important to understand following terminologies in order to avoid confusions and ambiguities:

        Forecast         A probable event where in the business is likely headed (Estimate of what is likely to
                         happen.)

         Budget          Future financial target or goals, which may or may not be equal to the forecast.

        Projection       A blueprint of forward-looking business options in answer to “What would happen if”.

 FINANCIAL FORECASTING: MEANING AND INTRODUCTION
Financial Forecasting is a process of estimating or predicting a company’s financial future by examining
historical performance of data like revenue, cash flow, expenses, or sales. It is at the heart of driving business
performance and stakeholder’s confidence. Financial projections performed to facilitate any decision-making
relevant for determining future business performance. It is emphasized on concept of “Today’s Commitment
for Tomorrow’s actions”. It basically includes the analysis of past business performance, current business
trends, and other relevant factors. In fact, Business honchos who adopt and maintain financial forecasting best
practices are better positioned to grow and to weather unexpected setbacks. Moreover, a financial plan that
estimates the projected income and projected expenses of a business, and a solid financial forecast contains
both macroeconomic factors and conditions that are specific to the organization. A thorough forecast includes
but is not limited to short and long-term outlooks on conditions that could impact revenues and contingencies
for expenditures not currently viewed as necessary.

 Importance of Financial Forecasting
Financial forecasts are a crucial part of business planning, budgeting, operations, funding that help leaders and
outside stakeholders make better choices. Few important points have been pointed:
    l     It serves as the basis for budgeting decisions.
    l     It gives businesses access to cohesive reports, allowing finance departments to establish business
          goals that are both realistic and feasible.
    l     It provides management valuable insights into the way the business performed in the past and the way
          it will compare in the future.

           that helps to build and enhance the investor’s confidence.

 Financial Forecasting vs. Budgeting
Based on research and expert arguments, a concrete financial plan is built on both forecasting and sound
spending guidance. It is important to note that the terms “financial forecasting” and “budgeting” are separate
process and can’t be used interchangeably. Financial forecasting is a critical first step in the budgeting process.
Organizations that work hard to create reliable financial forecasts are more likely to build realistic budgets.
Financial forecasting should always precede the budgeting process to ensure spending is in line with factors
that can impact overall financial performance. Those who create budgets without financial forecasts are at risk
of overspending and not having enough available cash for unexpected costs or shortfalls in revenue. Lacking
a forecast may also keep the business from greenlighting a new capital investment or launching a product that
may have ended up being a growth driver.

 Financial Forecasting Vs Financial Projection
Financial forecast is a statement of management’s expectations which is based on what top management
reasonably expects will happen to and in the company and the expected financial impacts. This is the information
that is published by publicly traded companies for stakeholders and the general public’s review. While on the
other hand, a financial projection essentially projects the likely outcome of one or more hypothetical scenarios
or assumptions. It is a tool used to explore business and market scenarios and predict outcomes before adjusting
the company’s plans. A financial projection is a snapshot of a possible business outcome that is often weighed
in terms of probability.

In nut shell, both financial forecasts and financial projections are forward-looking statements and predict future
outcomes based on specific assumptions. But it is important to understand demarcation line of difference
between them:
Financial forecasts reveal what is likely to happen based on expected events and business conditions (i.e.
Financial forecasts are what management expects to happen.)
Financial projections are what might happen in any number of hypothetical scenarios. For example, keeping
in the mind of current market conditions, and seasonal trends, the management of a wholesaler expects sales
to increase by 7% over the next quarter. Therefore, a 7% sales increase is his financial forecast for the period.
Whereas, company wants to make more profit than that, so he aims for an 10% sales increase. Therefore, his
budget calls for an 10% sales increase. The management still expects the company to achieve only 7%, but he
hopes for 10%, so he budgets accordingly and aims the sales team at that number. But rather than just crack a
whip over the sales team, the Management runs several financial projections to find a way to improve their odds
of reaching an 8% or larger sales increase.

 FINANCIAL FORECASTING COMPONENTS AND FACTORS
Following components and factors should be considered and incorporated for financial forecasting:




 FINANCIAL STATEMENT FORECASTING
A common type of forecasting in financial accounting is based on pro forma statements. It focuses on a business’s
future reports which are highly dependent on assumptions made during preparation, such as expected market
conditions. Because the term “pro forma” refers to projections or forecasts, pro-forma statements apply to any
financial document incorporating Statement of P&L, Balance sheet and Cash flow statements. Various methods
are used for forecasting financial statements. Basically there are two methods namely Quantitative methods
and Qualitative methods. Quantitative forecasting methods are used to make assumptions about the future
based on historical data. Whereas, Qualitative forecasting relies on experts’ knowledge and experience to
predict performance rather than historical numerical data. These forecasting methods are often called into
question, as they’re more subjective than quantitative methods and they can provide valuable insight into


                                                                                                              395
EP-CA&FM                                                                        Forecasting Financial Statements

forecasts and account for factors that can’t be predicted using historical data. Both the methods are discussed
below:
 (1) Based on Revenue (% of Turnover)
		
 As per this method, items like costs of goods sold (COGS), Stock and cash are calculated as a percentage
 of sales. Those percentages are then applied to future sales estimates to project each line item’s future
 value. For example, COGS is likely to increase proportionally with turnover; therefore, it’s to apply the
 same % estimate to each. To forecast the percent of sales, examine the percentage of each account’s
 historical profits related to sales. To calculate this, divide each account by its sales, assuming the numbers
 will remain steady. For example, if COGS has historically been 30% of sales, assume that trend will
 continue.
(2) Moving Average Method
 It is categorized into two parts namely, The average or Weighted average of previous periods to forecast
		
 the future. It is closely scrutinizing a business’s high or low demands. Hence, it is more suitable for short-
 term forecasting. For example, you can use it to forecast next month’s sales by averaging the previous
 quarter. Using weighted averages to incorporate current periods can increase the accuracy of moving
 average forecasts. For Moving Average:
		                                                 P1+P2+P3…/N
		 P = Average for a period
		 N = Total number of periods
(3) Constant Growth Rate
		
 It assumes a company’s historical growth rate will remain constant. Forecasting future revenue involves
 multiplying a company’s previous year’s revenue by its growth rate. Say, if Growth rate was 12% in 2021-22
 (i.e. P.Y), then, Constant rate @12% forecasting for 2022-23 (Next year) shall be considered as it excludes
 market fluctuations or supply chain issues.
(4) Regression Method
		
 This method is based on a relationship between two variables⁠: dependent and independent. The
 dependent variable represents the forecasted amount, while the independent variable is the factor
 that influences the dependent variable. E.g. Advertisement expense (Independent Variable) and Sales
 (Dependent). It means change in advertisement expense would lead to change in sales. It is based on
 equation:
		                                                  Y = BX + A
		 Y= Dependent variable (Forecasted number)
		 B = Slope line
		 X = Independent variable
		 A = Y-intercept
(5) Delphi Method
		
 The Delphi method i.e. Estimate-Talk-Estimate Technique (ETE) is a systematic and qualitative method of
 forecasting by collecting opinions from a group of financial experts through several rounds of questions.
 The Delphi method relies on experts who are knowledgeable about a specific area so they can forecast
 the outcome of future scenarios, predict the likelihood of an event, or reach consensus about a particular

       topic. The financial experts then fill out another questionnaire that gives them the opportunity to provide
       updated opinions based on what they understand from the summary report. It is one of most important
       qualitative method.

 FORECASTING OF PROFIT & LOSS (PROFITABILITY PROJECTIONS)
Typically, the starting point for Profit & Loss forecasting is to forecast of sales revenue. Moreover, the sales
production is closely interrelated. Hence they should be estimated together. Few points should be considered
while projection of profitability:
    l     It is advisable not to assume full Capacity utilization in the beginning year of operation. It means
          capacity utilization should be low in beginning years and rise gradually to reach the maximum level.
    l     It may be assumed that sales and production would be equal. Hence, adjustments towards finish goods
          stock is not required.
    l     Revenue shall be considered net of excise duty.
    l     So far as, the cost of production is concerned, the requirements of material per unit of output shall be
          considered and prices of are defined in Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) terms.
    l     Inflation factor shall be ignored and present cost of material shall be considered.
    l     Seasonal fluctuations in prices must be considered while estimation.
Following statement may be used for Profitability Projections :

 FORECASTING OF CASH FLOW STATEMENT
It is a statement of change in Cash and cash equivalents. Statement covers three activities namely Net Cash
from Operating Activities, Net Cash from Investing Activities, and Net Cash from Financing Activities. Basically,
Cash Flows are Inflows and Outflows of cash and cash equivalents. It is normally prepared and presented for
each period for which financial statements are presented. Cash Flow arises when the net effect of transaction
is either increase or decrease the amount of cash and cash equivalents. Let’s understand different activities
briefly:
 (1) Operating Activities:
		
 So far as operating activities is concerned, they are the principal revenue producing activities of business
 and generally result from the transactions and other event that enter into the determination of net profit or
 loss. It reflects Company’s ability to generate adequate operating cash flow helps in gaining confidence
 of the external parties like lenders and investors. Company with high surplus cash flow from operation has
 high market capitalization and which indicates quality of earnings.

                  iii.   Conversion of debentures into equity shares
                  iv. Purchase of business by issue of shares

(2) Investing Activities:
		
 It basically deals with Proceeds from sale/disposal of Non-Current Assets (whether Tangible/Intangible/
 Depreciable/Non-Depreciable) and Non-Operating incomes from investments shall be added such as :
      i.    Dividend received on shares held as investment
      ii.   Interest received on debentures held as investment
     iii.   Rent received from property held as investment
		 Lenders will be able to know where company has deployed the cash. Whether company has acquired

Following Points to be considered while preparing cash flow projections
      l   It’s not profit that repays loan; it is the cash that repays loan.
      l   It is important to disassociate the cash position from the profit of business entity.
      l   Timing of revenue recognition and expenses don’t match with timing of cash inflow and outflow.
      l   Banks should shift to cash flow-based lending from traditional assets-based lending.
      l   If company is not doing well, sales and net profit may increase due to window dressing of account but
          quality of earning (i.e., operating cash flow) may decline.
      l   If Net operating cash flow shows consistently declining trend over the period of 3-5 years, it’s an
          indication of incipient sickness.
      l   If company keeps investing in the CAPEX that indicates the company is focused on capacity building
          for future growth.
      l   If company keeps investing in financial assets like shares, debentures etc would indicate that
          management is not very much focused on expansion.
      l   As a lender, it is inevitable to match dividend pay-out with operating cash flow.
      l   Amount of dividend should not exceed the operating cash flow.

                               Basic Principles and Biases of Cash flow Estimation
  Separation          l Cash flow associated with Investment side and financing side should be separated.
   Principle          l Focus on Net Operating Profit After Tax [i.e. PAT + Interest(1-t)]

 Incremental          l Focus on Cash flow for firm with project less without project.
   Principle
   Post Tax           l Cash flow should be measured on “After Tax Basis”.
  Principles          l Important issues:

                              1.   What tax rate should be used to assess tax liability?
                             2.    How to treat losses?
                              3.   What is the effect of non-cash charges?
                 [1] What tax rate should be used to assess tax liability?
                      l Use Marginal Rate of tax instead of Average Rate of Tax

                 [2] How to treat losses?

                  Alt                    Project      Firm                          Action

                  2                       Loss        Profit   Take tax saving in yr of loss
                  3                      Profit       Loss     Defer taxes until firm makes profit
                  4                      Profit       Profit   Consider tax in yr of profit
                  Stand alone             Loss            -    Defer tax saving until project makes profit

                 [3] What is the effect of non-cash charges?
                 Examples:
                      i. Depreciation
                      ii. Issue of shares/dentures for consideration other than cash
                  iii. Conversion of debentures into equity shares
                  iv. Purchase of business by issue of shares
                      v. Deferred Tax Charge (or Benefit) and MAT Credit entitlement.
                 Note: Tax benefit of depreciation (Depreciation*Marginal Tax Rate)
                 Deferred Tax Liability or Assets:
                      l There is a difference between taxable income (As per Income Tax Regulations) and
                         Accounting Profit (As per GAAP)
                      l Difference may be permanent or temporary

                      l Permanent Difference (i.e. Some income is exempted but included in accounting
                         profit)
                      l Temporary Difference (Timing Difference)




                                                                                                              407
EP-CA&FM                                                                         Forecasting Financial Statements


                             Depreciation charged as per WDV for taxable income but as per SLM for
                              accounting profit.
                             Differences are found on year to year but total depreciation charges over
                              the life of asset would be same under both the methods.
                 l When Deferred Tax Liability or Assets arises?

                     Because of temporary difference between taxable income and accounting profit.
                     Deferred Tax Liability (Assets) is recognized when charge in the financial statements
                     is less (More) than the amount allowed for the tax purpose.

 Consistency     l Cash flow and discount rates applied to these cash flows must be in consistent with
  Principle          respect to investor group and inflation.
                 l Free Cash Flow to Firm

                 l Free Cash Flow to Equity

                 l Incorporate the expected inflation in the estimates of future cash flow and apply
                     nominal discount rate (NDR).
                 l NDR=[(1+RDR) *(1+EIR)]-1

                Where,
                RDR=Real Discount Rate
                EIR = Expected Inflation Rate

  Biases in     Because of the nature of cash flow estimation, it deals with future and errors in estimation
 Cash Flow      are bound to occur. Hence, critical importance of forecasting of cash flow is given and
 Estimation     adequate care should be given to guard against certain biases which may lead to
                overstatement or understatement of profitability and don’t reflect true and fair view of
                corporate performance. Overstatement of profitability in terms of executives faulty
                planning, over optimism which mainly deals with cognitive bias and organizational
                pressure. Whereas Understatement of profitability deals with under estimation of salvage
                value, ignorance of intangible benefits and sometimes value of future options will be
                overlooked.

 INTRODUCTION
Suppose a person is planning to commence business and no matter what the nature of the proposed business
be and how it is organised, he needs to address the following pertinent questions:
      i)    What capital investments he needs to make? That is, what kinds of real estate, machineries, R&D
            programmes, IT infrastructure, and so on should he invest in?
      ii)   How will he procure capital to pay for the proposed capital investments? That is, what will be the fusion
            of equity and debt in the proposed capital structure or financial plan?
   iii)     How will he deal with the day-to-day financial activities such as collection of receivables and paying to
            the suppliers of raw materials and other key services?
Now as already mentioned, the above mentioned vital questions are witnessed by every entrepreneur,
companies, organisations etc. in starting and managing the business. In this regard, the extensive knowledge of
financial management can assist substantially in forming robust financial decisions.
Financial management emerged as a distinct field of study at the turn of the 20th century. Its evolution may be
divided into three broad phases (though the demarcating lines between these phases are somewhat arbitrary)-
the traditional phase, the transitional phase, and the modern phase.
The traditional phase lasted for nearly four decades. The following were its important features:
   a)       The focus of financial management was mainly on certain episodic events like formation, issuance of
            capital, major expansion, merger, reorganisation, and liquidation in the life cycle of the firm.
   b)       The approach was mainly descriptive and institutional. The instruments of financing the institutions
            and procedures used in capital markets, and the legal facets of the financial events formed the core of
            financial management.
    c)      The outsider’s point of view was dominant. Financial management was viewed mainly from the point of
            view of the investment bankers, lenders, and other outside interests.
A typical work of the traditional phase is the The Financial Policy of Corporations by Arthur S. Dewing. This
book discusses at length the forms of securities, procedures used in issuing these securities, bankruptcy,
reorganisations, mergers, consolidations, and combinations.
The treatment of these topics is essentially descriptive, institutional, and legalistic.
The transitional phase began around the early 1940s and continued through the early 1950s. Though the nature
of financial management during this phase was similar to that of the traditional phase, higher emphasis was
placed on day-to-day problems faced by financial managers in the areas of funds analysis, planning, and
control. The focus shifted to working capital management. A representative work of this phase is Essays on
Business Finance by Wilford J. Eitman et al.

Introduction (Financial Management)                                                                     LESSON 11

The modern phase began in the mid 1950s and has witnessed an accelerated pace of development with the
infusion of ideas from economic theory and application of quantitative methods of analysis. The distinctive
features of the modern phase are-
   a)    The central concern of financial management is considered to be a rational matching of funds to their
         uses so as to maximise the wealth of current shareholders.
   b)    The approach of financial management has become more analytical and quantitative.
Since the beginning of the modern phase many significant and seminal developments have occurred in the
domain of capital budgeting, asset pricing theory, capital structure theory, efficient market theory, option pricing
theory, agency theory, valuation models, dividend policy, working capital management, financial modelling,
and behavioural finance. Many more exciting developments are in the offing making finance an attractive and
challenging field.

 MEANING OF FINANCE
Finance is the backbone of any business. It helps in defining the feasible area of operation for any type of
business activities and therefore is the foundation for any strategic planning. It may also be defined as an art
or a science of managing money. Finance function is the procurement of funds and their effective utilization in
business concerns.
In other words, finance is considered to be the foundation of basic activities of any business. Particularly in
production and marketing activities, finance functions in the same way as oil functions in the operation of
machines or blood functions in the human body. In the absence of finance, nobody can imagine either of setting
up a business or its operations and development. The term finance is derived from the Latin word ‘finis’ which
means end/finish. Finance can also be interpreted in many ways such as fund, money, investment, capital,
amount etc. Finance act as a medium for business which involves the acquisition and usage of funds in various
departments such as production department, purchase department, research and development etc.
Finance also refers to the science that describes the management, creation and study of money, banking,
credit, investments, assets and liabilities. Finance consists of financial systems, which include public, private
and government bodies and the study of finance and financial instruments, which can relate to countless assets
and liabilities.
Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary defines finance as the ‘Science on study of the management of
funds’ and the management of fund as the system that includes the circulation of money, the granting of credit,
the making of investments, and the provision of banking facilities.
Finance is a term for matters regarding the management, creation, and study of money and investments. It
involves the use of credit and debt, securities, and investment to finance current projects using future income
flows. Because of this temporal aspect, finance is closely linked to the time value of money, interest rates, and
other related topics.
Finance can be broadly divided into three categories:
    l    Public finance
    l    Corporate finance
    l    Personal finance
A brief description of the above mentioned broad categories of finance is provided below-
    i)   Public finance: Central government, State government and Local government—all use finances which
         are obtained from various sources and which are used according to predetermined policies and

                                                                                                                415
EP-CA&FM                                                                       Introduction (Financial Management)

          procedures. Governments have the right to collect finances or revenues through taxation and other
          means and have authorities to use such finances within the constitutional limits.
		 However, the objectives of Governmental activities are not to earn profit like private institutions, the
   objectives are to achieve social and economic upliftment. Government raises and uses finances for
   attaining the objective of maximum social advantage. That is why ‘public finance’ has been made a
   separate branch of study, wherein government financial matters are studied thoroughly and formally.
   ii)    Corporate finance: Corporate finance is the subfield of finance that deals with how corporations
          address funding sources, capital structuring, accounting, and investment decisions.
		 Corporate finance is often concerned with maximizing shareholder value through long- and short-term
   financial planning and the implementation of various strategies. Corporate finance activities range from
   capital investment to tax considerations. Corporate finance is concerned with how businesses fund their
   operations in order to maximize profits and minimize costs. It deals with the day-to-day operations of
   a business’ cash flows as well as with long-term financing goals (e.g., issuing bonds) and in addition to
   capital investments, corporate finance is concerned with monitoring cash flows, accounting, preparing
   financial statements, and taxation.
   iii)   Personal finance: Personal finance is a term that covers managing your money as well as saving and
          investing. It encompasses budgeting, banking, insurance, mortgages, investments, and retirement, tax,
          and estate planning. The term often refers to the entire industry that provides financial services to
          individuals and households and advises them about financial and investment opportunities.
Individual goals and desires—and a plan to fulfil those needs within your financial constraints—also impact
how you approach the above items. To make the most of your income and savings, it’s essential to become
financially savvy—it will help you distinguish between good and bad advice and make intelligent financial
decisions.

“It is concerned with the efficient use of an important economic resource namely, capital funds”. – Solomon
Financial management “as an application of general managerial principles to the area of financial decision-
making. – Howard and Upton
Financial management “is an area of financial decision-making, harmonizing individual motives and enterprise
goals”. – Weston and Brigham
Financial management “is the operational activity of a business that is responsible for obtaining and effectively
utilizing the funds necessary for efficient operations. – Joseph and Massie
“Financial management is the activity concerned with planning, raising, controlling and administering of funds
used in the business.” – Guthman and Dougal
“Financial management is that area of business management devoted to a judicious use of capital and a careful
selection of the source of capital in order to enable a spending unit to move in the direction of reaching the
goals.” – J.F. Brandley

According to the Wheeler, “Business finance is that business activity which concerns with the acquisition and
conversation of capital funds in meeting financial needs and overall objectives of a business enterprise”.
E.W Walker- “Business finance is to planning, coordinating, controlling and implementing of financial activities
of business institution.”
Henry Hoagland- “Business Finance is concerned with the financing and investment decisions made by the
management of companies in pursuit of corporate goals.”
Professor Gloss and Baker- “Business finance is concerned with the sources of funds available to enterprises
of all sizes and the proper use of money or credit obtained from such sources.”
Parhter and Wert- “Business finance deals primarily with raising, administering and disbursing funds by privately
owned business units operating in non-financial fields of industry”.
According to the Encyclopedia of Social Sciences, “Corporation finance deals with the financial problems of
corporate enterprises. These problems include the financial aspects of the promotion of new enterprises and
their administration during early development, the accounting problems connected with the distinction between
capital and income, the administrative questions created by growth and expansion, and finally, the financial
adjustments required for the bolstering up or rehabilitation of a corporation which has come into financial
difficulties”.
Thus, financial management is broadly concerned with raising of funds, creating value to the assets of the
business enterprise by efficient allocation of funds. It is the study of integration of the flow of funds in the most
optimal manner to maximize the returns of a firm by taking proper decisions in utilizing the funds. In other words,
raising of funds should involve minimum cost and to bring maximum returns.

 NATURE, SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
In modern times, we cannot imagine a world without the use of money. In fact, money is the life-blood of business
because all our economic activities are carried out through the use of money. For carrying on business, we
need resources which are pooled in terms of money. It is used for obtaining physical and material resources
for carrying out productive activities and business operations which affect sales and pay compensation to
suppliers of resources, physical as well as monetary. Hence financial management is considered as an organic
function of a business and has rightly become an important one.
Finance is an essential and indispensable part of any organization. It is difficult for organizations, whether
profit-making or otherwise, to sustain themselves for long without proper finances. Not just that, the efficient
management of these financial resources is essential to be sustainable and viable in the long-run.
A group of experts defines Financial Management as simply the task of providing funds needed by the business
or enterprise on terms that are most favourable in the light of its objectives. The approach, thus, is concerned
almost exclusively with the procurement of funds and could be widened to include instruments, institutions
and practices through which funds are raised. It also covers the legal and accounting relationship between a
company and its sources of funds. Financial Management is certainly broader than procurement of funds.
Financial management is strategic planning, organising, directing, and controlling of financial undertakings in an
organisation. It also encompasses applying management principles to the financial assets of an organisation,
while also playing a significant part in fiscal management.
Financial management refers to the effective and efficient planning, organizing, directing and controlling the
financial activities and processes of an organization. This includes but is not limited to fund procurement,
allocation of financial resources, utilization of funds, etc.
It is to be noted that financial management is pervasive and is applicable to all forms of organisations, i.e.,

                                                                                                                417
EP-CA&FM                                                                         Introduction (Financial Management)

business organisations, philanthropic organisations, educational organisations, religious organisations and so
on and so forth. In nutshell, wherever finance is involved, financial management is crucial for effective planning,
procurement and utilisation of funds.
Thus, financial management is related not only to ‘fund-raising’ but encompasses wider perspective of managing
the finances for the company efficiently. In the developed state of a capital market, raising funds is not a problem;
the real problem is to put the capital resources to efficient use through effective financial planning, financial
organisation and financial control and to deal with tasks like ensuring the availability of funds, allocating them
for different uses, managing them, investing funds, controlling costs, forecasting financial requirements, doing
profit planning and estimating rate of return on investment and assessing working capital etc.

 TYPES OF FINANCIAL DECISIONS




 INVESTMENT DECISIONS
Investment decision is the most important decision for value creation. Investment ordinarily means utilisation
of money for profits or returns. This could be done by creating physical assets with the money and carrying on
business or purchasing shares or debentures of a company.
Investments necessarily involve uncertainty, and are therefore quite risky. Within a firm, a finance manager
decides that in which activity resources of the firm needs to be channelized.
For example, a marketing manager may like to have a new show room, a production manager a new lathe
machine and a personnel manager may propose for higher wages or salaries for labour or staff, with the
objective of enhancing productivity. . Top management may like to foray into new areas of business or territories
(national / international) or proposed to launch a new product with the aim of increasing profits or capturing a
lion share in the industry will trigger the need for investments and in view of this, investment decisions becomes
significant. .
It is to be noted that in financial management, investment decisions relates to capital budgeting. In other words,
investment decisions are concerned with the question whether adding to capital assets today will increase
the revenues of tomorrow to cover costs. Thus investment decisions are commitment of money resources at
different time in expectation of economic returns in future dates.

Introduction (Financial Management)                                                                       LESSON 11

Categories of Investment Decisions
The most common categories of investment decisions are as under-
    1.    Inventory Management : Holding of stocks of materials is unavoidable for smooth running of a business.
          The expenditure on stocks comes in the category of investments.
   2.     Strategic Investment: In this case, the firm makes investment decisions in order to strengthen its market
          power. The return on such investment will not be immediate.
   3.     Investment on Modernisation: In this case, the firm decides to adopt a new and better technology in
          place of the old one for the sake of cost reduction. It is also known as capital deepening process.
   4.     Investment in New Business: In this case, the firm decides to start a new business or diversify into new
          lines of production for which a new set of machines are to be purchased.
   5.     Replacement Investment : In this category, the firm takes decisions about the replacement of worn out
          and obsolete assets by new ones.
   6.     Expansion Investment : In this case, the firm decides to expand the productive capacity for existing
          products and thus grows further in a uni-direction. This type of investment is also called capital widening.
Thus, investment decisions encompass wide and complex matters involving the following areas:
    –     capital budgeting
    –     cost of capital
    –     measuring risk
    –     management of liquidity and current assets
    –     expansion and contraction involving business failure and re-organisations
    –     buy or hire or lease an asset.
Factors Determining Investment Decisions
The three key factors that influence investment decisions are as under:
    (i)   Estimation of capital outlays and the future earnings of the proposed project focusing on the task of
          value engineering and market forecasting.
   (ii)   Availability of capital and considerations of cost of capital focusing attention on financial analysis.
  (iii)   A set of standards by which to select a project for implementation and maximising returns therefrom
          focusing attention on logic and arithmetic.
As mentioned that investment decisions mainly focus on capital expenditure decisions, in view of this, it is
imperative to have a discussion on the mentioned topic.
Capital budgeting – Capital Budgeting refers to the planning process which is used for decision making of the
long term investment that whether the projects are fruitful for the business and will provide the required returns
in the future years or not and it is important because capital expenditure requires huge amount of funds so
before doing such expenditure in capital, the companies need to assure themselves that the spending will bring
profits in the business.
Capital Budgeting is a decision-making process where a company plans and determines any long term Capex
whose returns in terms of cash flows are expected to be received beyond a year. Investment decisions may
include any of the below:


                                                                                                                    419
EP-CA&FM                                                                          Introduction (Financial Management)

      i)    Expansion
      ii)   Acquisition
   iii)     Replacement
   iv)      New Product
   v)       R&D (Research & Development)
   vi)      Major Advertisement Campaign
  vii)      Welfare investment
The capital budgeting decision making remains in understanding whether the projects and investment areas are
worth the funding of cash through the capitalization structure of the company debt, equity, retained earnings –
or not. The characteristics of capital budgeting are as under:
   a)       It involves high risk
   b)       Large profits are estimated
   c)       Long time period between the initial investments and estimated returns
(For more details on capital budgeting, please refer to Lesson 13- Capital Budgeting)
Investment decisions have, thus, become the most important area in the decision making process of a company.
Such decisions are essentially made after evaluating the different proposals with reference to growth and
profitability projections of the company. The choice helps achieve the long term objectives of the company i.e.,
survival and growth, preserving market share of its products and retaining leadership in its production activity.
Investment Decision Analysis
The investment decision process:
      l     Generate cash flow forecasts for the projects,
      l     Determine the appropriate opportunity cost of capital,
      l     Use the cash flows and the cost of capital to compute the relevant investment criteria.
Issues:
      l     Why use cash flows and not accounting earnings? - can we “spend” earnings?
      l     Which cash flows do we use?
              –   total vs. incremental cash flows,
              –   how to treat sunk costs
      l     Which investment criterion do we use, and why?
              –   Net Present Value (NPV),
              –   Payback / Discounted payback period
              –   Average Accounting Return
              –   Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
              –   Profitability Index
      l     Mutually exclusive vs. independent projects.

    l    Sensitivity analysis.
          –   How sensitive are the criterion to changes in key assumptions.
Earnings vs. Cash Flows
    l    You cannot spend earnings! Need cash to build a plant, not earnings.
    l    Earnings can be manipulated by creative accounting.
Classic Example: The movie Forrest Gump (Paramount Pictures, 1994)
Winston Groom, the author of the book on which the movie is based, was promised 2% of the net income on
the movie. The movie grossed over $650 million worldwide. However, Groom got nothing! Paramount reported
a $62 million loss on the movie, because of a 32% commission the studio charged the movie to cover costs on
future films that might fail!!
Now the question is whether Paramount didn’t made a cash profit on the movie?
The answer is earnings can be what you want them to be, while cash flows are what you receive in your bank
account, and are hence much more real and transparent.

 Things to check from Cash Flow from Investing Activities
    1.   Source of investments made during the year: Cash flow from Investing activity is generally a negative
         cash flow component of the cash flow statement. One should observe whether the investments made
         by the company are coming on the back of sufficient cash flow from operations or retained earnings, or
         whether the company has borrowed money or raised additional capital to raise the money needed for
         the investments made. In any case, what is important is that the return on investment is greater than the
         cost of capital. Going a step further would be to understand how that return is then distributed amongst
         various stakeholders, a component of cash flow from financing activities.
   2.    Qualitative nature of the investments made by the company: Imagine a non-finance company
         employing capital raised from external sources for making non-current investments in debt or equity
         securities rather than investing that capital in buying core business growth assets such as plant and
         machinery etc. It raises a couple of questions regarding the attractiveness of the industry in which the
         company operates, the growth and expansion strategy of the company, the possibility of expansion,
         company’s ability to expand and the appropriate timing for the same etc.
		 The inter-period and intra-firm pattern of investments made by companies in an industry read with
   management discussion and analysis not only draws a picture about the company’s future plans but
   also indicates the prospects of profitability in the industry and direction of development of business at
   an industry level considering all players in that industry.
		 In case of capital- intensive industries wherein huge capex is needed for expansion and maintenance,
   one must observe that a persistently large negative cash flow from investing activity component over
   many years could indicates that the company is undertaking expansion in the business and must further
   analyse the nature of such an expansion. This can be observed in case of other businesses as well
   wherein there is surge in cash outflow from investment activity.
   3.    Does business have high capital expenditure requirements?: In the book “Investment Checklist” by
         Michael Shearn, he gives a detail account of how one can approach this question. He emphasises
         that “if the capital requirements are high, then the cash flows of the business need to be continually
         reinvested in the business just to maintain existing assets. High capital expenditures reduce cash flow,
         which is what the value of a business is based on”. One can observe this by looking at the ratio of
         capital expenditure to sales. One must also observe the capital requirements in terms of maintenance

                                                                                                              421
EP-CA&FM                                                                          Introduction (Financial Management)

           capital expenditure and growth capital expenditure and determining how long the assets last before
           they need to be replaced, as highlighted in the book.
   4.      Capitalisation of Operating Expenses: Capitalisation of operating expenses not only shows higher
           earnings but also a higher cash flow from operations. These capitalised expenses are shown under
           cash flow from investing activities. In the book “Financial Shenanigans” by Howard M Schilt, he gave
           the example of WorldComm, where some senior executives classified billions of dollars (a whopping
           58.588 billion dollars) of normal operating costs as capital equipment purchases, thereby inflating
           profits and cash flow from operations.
		         He also recommends that one must keep an eye on growing fixed asset accounts or “soft” asset accounts
           (eg. Other assets), which may show signs of aggressive capitalisation. Another recommendation by him
           was to keep a check if some companies are classifying inventory purchases under investing activity.
   5.      Inorganic Expansion of Business: Cash flow from investing activities includes cash payments made
           to and received from inorganic expansion and development of business in the form of merger and
           acquisitions, takeovers etc. It is pertinent to observe the efficiency of such inorganic acquisitions and
           synergies resulting from such deals. Inorganic acquisition of a business which is unrelated to the
           core business of the acquiring company should be further investigated and evaluated for value to
           shareholders and other relevant stakeholders. One can also look at the pattern of acquisitions and
           mergers by the company and how effective they have been in the past.
		 One classic example of such an inorganic expansion was the acquisition of Sterling Drugs, a
   pharmaceutical company by Kodak, an imaging and photography company in 1987. The acquisition
   was a massive failure and eventually resulted in a big loss of value to the shareholders, ending up with
   sale of Sterling Drugs to the Sanofi Group and partly to SmithKline Beecham in 1993 and 1994.
   6.      Churn in Business and Sale of Business Units or Assets: While the cash flow from investing activities
           is an indicator of how new cash or existing cash is employed to generate future profitability, it also
           includes the cash flow from sale of assets, sale of business units etc. One should note the strategic
           direction of the company as well as the implication of such divestitures on the value of the shareholders.
           Under the Companies Act, 2013, there are specific provisions regarding sale of assets and business
           units to related parties especially directors of the company. One must pay attention on whether the
           transactions have taken place at a fair price and that all necessary compliances are in place.
      7.   In-house expenditure and research and development: In terms of the accounting standards, Investing
           Activities refers to “acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other assets not included in cash
           equivalents”. It must be noted that only those expenditures that result in recognition of an asset in the
           balance sheet are eligible for classification as investing activities. Therefore, expenditures such as
           advertising and promotional activities or research and development, especially in-house development
           expenditure, typical in case of pharma or technological companies warrant special attention.

 Understanding Cash Flow from Investing Activities
In many cases, a firm may have a negative overall cash flow for a given quarter. If the company cannot generate
positive cash flow from its business operations, a negative overall cash flow is not necessarily a bad thing.
An item on the cash flow statement belongs in the investing activities section if it is the result of any gains (or
losses) from investments in financial markets and operating subsidiaries.
An investing activity also refers to cash spent on investments in capital assets such as property, plant, and
equipment, which is collectively referred to as capital expenditure, or CAPEX. Below is a more comprehensive
list of cash flows that can stem from a firm’s investing activities:

                                                      Purchasing and selling long-term assets and other
                                                      investments

The following items are not covered under the cash flow from investing activities:
    l    Interest payments or dividends
    l   Debt, equity, or other forms of financing
    l   Depreciation of capital assets (even though the purchase of these assets is part of investing)
    l   All income and expenses related to normal business operations

 FINANCING DECISIONS
Determining the best capital structure or financing decision is the next step in financial management for
executing the investment decision once taken. A look at the balance-sheet of a company shows its sources
of long-term finance i.e., how much funds it has procured from equity shareholders, preference shareholders,
debentureholders, term loans from banks / financial institutions etc.
Financing decisions are concerned with the determination of how much funds to procure from the various
avenues available i.e., the financing mix or capital structure. Let us quickly have a look on some definitions of
capital structure in order to develop a basic understanding on the term.
  “Capital structure is essentially concerned with how the firm decides to divide its cash flows into two
  broad components, a fixed component that is earmarked to meet the obligations toward debt capital and
  a residual component that belongs to equity shareholders”-P. Chandra.
Capital structure refers to the amount of debt and/or equity employed by a firm to fund its operations and
finance its assets. A firm’s capital structure is typically expressed as a debt-to-equity or debt-to-capital ratio.
From a technical perspective, the capital structure is the careful balance between equity and debt that a
business uses to finance its assets, day-to-day operations, and future growth. Capital Structure is the mix
between owner’s funds and borrowed funds.
    l   Funds = Owner’s funds + Borrowed funds
    l   Owner’s funds (Equity) = Equity share capital + Preference share capital + Reserves and Surplus +
        Retained Earnings
    l   Borrowed funds = Loans + Debentures + Public Deposits
In short, Capital Structure is the mixture of long-term sources of funds. Capital Structure is optimal when the
proportion of debt and equity maximizes the value of the equity share of the company.

                                                                                                               423
EP-CA&FM                                                                            Introduction (Financial Management)

In lesson 15, we would study in detail how the change in capital structure can impact the valuation of a firm.
In business organisations , financing decision today, has become fully integrated with top-management policy
formulation via capital budgeting, long-range planning, evaluation of alternate uses of funds, and establishment
of measurable standards of performance in financial terms.
Financial decision making is concerned more and more with the questions as to how cost of funds be measured,
proposals for capital using projects be evaluated, or how far the financing policy influences cost of capital or
should corporate funds be committed to or withheld from certain purposes and how the expected returns on
projects be measured.
(Note: In lesson 14, the technique of cost of capital has been elaborated).
Optimal use of funds is one of the biggest concern of financing decisions and top managements in corporate
sector are more concerned with planning the sources and uses of funds and measuring performance. New
measurement techniques, utilising computers, have facilitated efficient capital allocation through financing
decisions. Both Investment decision and financial decisions are jointly made as an effective way of financial
management in corporate units. No doubt, the purview of these decisions is separate, but they affect each
other. Financial decisions, as discussed earlier, encompass determination of the proportion of equity capital
to debt to achieve an optimal capital structure, and to balance the fixed and working capital requirements in
the financial structure of the company. This important area of financing decision making, aims at maximising
returns on investment and minimising the risk. The risk and return analysis is a common tool for investment
and financing decisions for designing an optimal capital structure of a corporate unit. It may be mentioned that
debt adds to the riskiness of the capital structure of a firm. This part of financial management is the analysis of
company through earnings before interest and taxes, variable costs, contribution. It is called a study of operating
leverages. Further, the earnings per share to be given to shareholders is analysed through the technique of
financial leverage. When study of both these aspects is made it is known as combined leverage. The leverage
concepts have been discussed in detail in lesson 15.

 Factors affecting Financing Decision
While taking financing decisions the finance manager keeps in mind the following factors:
      1.   Cost: The cost of raising finance from various sources is different and finance managers always prefer
           the source with minimum cost.
   2.      Risk: More risk is associated with borrowed fund as compared to owner’s fund securities. Finance
           manager compares the risk with the cost involved and prefers securities with moderate risk factor.
   3.      Cash Flow Position: The cash flow position of the company also helps in selecting the securities.
           With smooth and steady cash flow companies can easily afford borrowed fund securities but when
           companies have shortage of cash flow, then they must go for owner’s fund securities only.
   4.      Control Considerations: If existing shareholders want to retain the complete control of business then
           they prefer borrowed fund securities to raise further fund. On the other hand if they do not mind to lose
           the control then they may go for owner’s fund securities.
   5.      Floatation Cost: It refers to cost involved in issue of securities such as broker’s commission, underwriters
           fees, expenses on prospectus, etc. Firm prefers securities which involve least floatation cost.

 Understanding Cash Flow from Financing Activities
The financing activity in the cash flow statement focuses on how a firm raises capital and pays it back to
investors through capital markets. These activities also include paying cash dividends, adding or changing

loans, or issuing and selling more stock. This section of the statement of cash flows measures the flow of cash
between a firm and its owners and creditors.

A positive number indicates that cash has come into the company, which boosts its asset levels. A negative
figure indicates when the company has paid out capital, such as retiring or paying off long-term debt or making
a dividend payment to shareholders.

Examples of common cash flow items stemming from a firm’s financing activities are:

    l   Receiving cash from issuing stock or spending cash to repurchase shares

    l   Receiving cash from issuing debt or paying down debt

    l   Paying cash dividends to shareholders

    l   Proceeds received from employees exercising stock options

    l   Receiving cash from issuing hybrid securities, such as convertible debt

 DIVIDEND DECISIONS
The dividend decision is another major area of financial management. The financial manager must decide
whether the firm should distribute all profits or retain them or distribute a portion and retain the balance.
Theoretically, this decision should depend on whether the company or its shareholders are in the position
to better utilise the funds, and to earn a higher rate of return on funds. However, in practice, both dividends
and retention of profits are important financial signals to the market, which continuously tries to assess the
future profitability and risk of a company. A number of other factors like the market price of shares, the trend
of earning, the tax position of the shareholders, cash flow position, requirement of funds for future growth, and
restrictions under the Companies Act etc. also play an important role in the determination of dividend policy of
business enterprise. The finance manager has to take a decision regarding optimum dividend payout ratio, he
also has to take decisions relating to bonus issue and interim dividend.

It can be said that investment, financing and dividend decision are inter-related to each other. Financial
Management is concerned with all three investment, financing and dividend decisions in relation to objectives
of the company. Investment ordinarily means profitable utilization of funds. Investment decisions are concerned
with the question whether adding to capital assets today will increase the net worth of the firm. Financing
is next step in financial management for executing the investment decision once taken. Financial decision
making is concerned with the question as to how funds requirements should be met keeping in view their cost,
and how far the financing policy influences cost of capital. The dividend decision is another major area of
financial management. It helps the financial manager in deciding whether the firm should distribute all profits or
retain them or distribute a portion and retain the balance. Management needs to ensure that enough funding is
available at the right time to meet the needs of the business. Hence, making of financial policy in taking three
important decision of business viz. Financing, Investing and Dividend are always helpful to the management to
take key corporate decision like expansion, diversification etc.

The following are the some major factors which influence the dividend policy of the firm.

1. Legal requirements

There is no legal compulsion on the part of a company to distribute dividend. However, there certain conditions
imposed by law regarding the way dividend is distributed. Basically there are three rules relating to dividend
payments. They are the net profit rule, the capital impairment rule and insolvency rule.


                                                                                                              425
EP-CA&FM                                                                            Introduction (Financial Management)

2. Firm’s liquidity position
Dividend payout is also affected by firm’s liquidity position. In spite of sufficient retained earnings, the firm may
not be able to pay cash dividend if the earnings are not held in cash.
3. Repayment need
A firm uses several forms of debt financing to meet its investment needs. These debt must be repaid at the
maturity. If the firm has to retain its profits for the purpose of repaying debt, the dividend payment capacity
reduces.
4. Expected rate of return
If a firm has relatively higher expected rate of return on the new investment, the firm prefers to retain the
earnings for reinvestment rather than distributing cash dividend.
5. Stability of earning
If a firm has relatively stable earnings, it is more likely to pay relatively larger dividend than a firm with relatively
fluctuating earnings.

 Stable Dividend Policy: A Policy of Dividend Smoothing
Lintner (1956) had observed that managers tend to value stable dividend policies and corporations tend to
smooth dividends relative to earnings. That is, dividends are increased gradually and rarely cut, resulting in a
much lower variability of dividends as compared to the variability in earnings.
Most Companies adapt a basic policy of maintaining its internal reserves to ensure stable income far into the
future, while at the same time seek to distribute a sufficient amount of earnings to shareholders in accordance
with business results. with a decrease in EPS, DPS has decreased and with increase in earnings the dividend
per share has increased. However increase in dividends is lagging behind increase in earnings in order to
‘smoothen’ or ‘stabilize’ dividend payments over the time.
Firm may adapt any of the following stable dividend policies:
      l   Stable dividend payout ratio
      l   Stable dividends per share
      l   A regular plus extra dividend policy

426
Introduction (Financial Management)                                                                       LESSON 11

   (i)    Stable Dividend Payout Ratio: As per this policy the percentage of dividends paid out of earnings
          remains constant.




		
		Example: if a company adopts a 30% payout ratio and if EPS is Rs 100, then shareholder having 10
  shares will receive Rs.300 as dividend under this policy.
   ii)    Stable Dividends Per Share: According to this policy, the firm pays a certain fixed amount of dividend
          per share every year. Annual dividend per share is increased only when the company reaches a new
          level of earnings and expects to maintain it.




		
   iii)   A Regular Plus Extra Dividend Policy: According to this policy a certain fixed percentage or a minimum
          amount of dividend is paid every year, which is referred to as regular dividend. The firm pays ‘additional’
          or ‘extra’ dividend if earnings are higher than normal in any year.

 Rationale for stable dividend policy:
Most firms adapt a stable dividend policy. If a firm’s earnings are temporarily depressed or if it needs a substantial
amount of funds for investment, then it might well maintain its regular dividend using borrowed funds to meet its
needs, until things returned to normal. The logic or rationale for stable dividend policy is:
     i)   Stockholders like stable dividends – many of them depend on dividend income, and if dividends were
          cut, this might cause serious hardship to them. A stable dividend policy is desirous for many investors
          such as retired persons, who take dividends as a source to meet their current living expenses.
    ii)   A stable dividend policy would reduce investor uncertainty, and reductions in uncertainty are generally
          associated with lower capital costs and higher stock prices, other things being equal.
   iii)   Institutional investors generally prefer to invest in companies having stable dividend records.
   iv)    Adoption of stable dividends is advantageous for a company interested in raising funds from external


                                                                                                                 427
EP-CA&FM                                                                           Introduction (Financial Management)

           sources as shareholders willingly invest in companies having stable dividends as they have more
           confidence in such companies.
The disadvantage is that such a policy might decrease corporate flexibility. Once a company has adapted a
stable dividend policy, any change in such a policy may have adverse effects on the company image and may
result in creating serious doubts in the minds of investors about financial standing of the company, which might
prove to be very dangerous for the company at a later stage.

 DECISION CRITERIA
Decision criteria depends upon the objective to be achieved through the instrumentality of decision making
process. The main objectives which a business organisation pursues are maximisation of return and minimisation
of costs.
A fair decision criterion should distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable proposals and solve the
problem of selection of the best alternatives from amongst the various alternatives available in a given situation
to achieve the above objectives. A fair decision criterion should follow the following two fundamental principles
i.e. (1) the “Bigger and Better” principle; (2) “A Bird in Hand is Better than Two in the Bush” principle. The first
principle suggests that bigger benefits are preferable to smaller ones; whereas the second one suggests that
early benefits are preferable to later benefits.
Decision criteria in financial management can be studied under two separate heads viz. The criteria for
investment decisions; and the criteria for the financing decisions.
Criteria for investment decisions are mainly concerned with planning and control of capital expenditure through
budgeting process following the tools of analysis viz. pay back period, accounting rate of return, discounted
cash flow methods e.g., net present value method, etc. We shall discuss these methods for evaluating investment
decisions in detail in the study relating to capital budgeting in Lesson 13. However, the essence and the inherent
spirit in these techniques is based on logic which helps in the decision making process.
Both the above principles are based on the assumption “other things being equal” which is a rare reality.
But in practice the decision process very much adheres to these principles particularly in the areas of capital
budgeting decisions and determining the cost of capital in project financing proposals.
As a matter of fact, these techniques have been founded on the following decision criteria:
      1.   Urgency: The use of ‘urgency’ is treated as criterion for selection of investment projects in many
           corporate units/ business enterprises/government set up. Urgency is assessed on the following basis:
           (a)   it provides sufficient justification for undertaking a project;
           (b)   it provides immediate contribution for attainment of objectives of the project; and
           (c)   it maximises profits.
		 Although urgency as criterion lacks objectivity, being non-quantifiable, yet it definitely provides an
   ordinal ranking scale for selection of projects on preferential pre-exemption basis.
   2.      Pay back: Time is of essence while selecting this criterion for investment decisions. The decision is
           taken on the basis of quickness in pay off of the investments. Pay back simply measures the time
           required for cash flows from the project to return the initial investment to the firm’s account. Projects,
           on the basis of this criterion, having quicker pay backs are preferred. For example, imagine a company
           invests £200,000 in new manufacturing equipment which results in a positive cash flow of £50,000 per
           year.

428
Introduction (Financial Management)                                                                LESSON 11

        Payback Period = £200,000 / £50,000. In this case, the payback period would be 4 years because
        200,000 divided by 50,000 is 4.
		 Another example of payback period.
          1. The ABC company is planning to purchase a machine known as machine X. Machine X would cost
             $25,000 and would have a useful life of 10 years with zero salvage value. The expected annual
             cash inflow of the machine is $10,000. Compute payback period of machine X and conclude
             whether or not the machine would be purchased if the maximum desired payback period of ABC
             company is 3 years.
		Solution
		 Since the annual cash inflow is even in this project, we can simply divide the initial investment by
   the annual cash inflow to compute the payback period. It is shown below:
		 Payback period = $25,000/$10,000
		 = 2.5 years.
		 According to payback period analysis, the purchase of machine X is desirable because
   its payback period is 2.5 years which is shorter than the maximum payback period of the
   company.
          2.   Due to increased demand, the management of XYZ Beverage Company is considering to purchase
               a new equipment to increase the production and revenues. The useful life of the equipment is 10
               years and the company’s maximum desired payback period is 4 years. The inflow and outflow of
               cash associated with the new equipment is given below:
		 Initial cost of equipment: $37,500
		
 Annual cash inflows:
 Cost of ingredients: $45,000
		
		 Salaries expenses: $13,500
		             Maintenance expenses: $1,500
		 Should XYZ Beverage Company purchase the new equipment? Use payback method for deriving
   answer.
		
 Step 1:
		 In order to compute the payback period of the equipment, we need to work out the net annual
   cash inflow by deducting the total of cash outflow from the total of cash
		 inflow associated with the equipment.
		
 Computation of net annual cash inflow:
 $75,000 – ($45,000 + $13,500 + $1,500) = $15,000
		
		
 Step 2:
		 Now, the amount of investment required to purchase the equipment would be divided by the
   amount of net annual cash inflow (computed in step 1) to find the payback period of the equipment.
		 = $37,500/$15,000
		 =2.5 years

                                                                                                          429
EP-CA&FM                                                                        Introduction (Financial Management)

 According to payback method, the equipment should be purchased because the payback period
		
 of the equipment is 2.5 years which is shorter than the maximum desired payback period of 4
 years.
         3.   The management of ABC company wants to reduce its labor cost by installing a new machine.
              Two types of machines are available in the market – machine X and machine Y. Machine X would
              cost $18,000 where as machine Y would cost $15,000. Both the machines can reduce annual
              labor cost by $3,000. Which is the best machine to purchase according to payback method?
		Solution:
		 Payback period of machine X: $18,000/$3,000 = 6 years
		 Payback period of machine y: $15,000/$3,000 = 5 years
		 According to payback method, machine Y is more desirable than machine X because it has a
   shorter payback period than machine X.
		 Pay back decision criterion does not follow the principles laid down above viz. “the bigger and
   better” and “bird in hand”. It ignores the first principle completely as it does not take into account
   the cash flows after investment has been recovered. It also does not satisfy entirely the second
   principle as it assigns zero value to the receipts, subsequent to recovery of the amount.
   3.   Rate of return: It provides another decision criterion based on accounting records or projected
        statements to measure profitability as annual percentage of capital employed. Rate of return is arrived
        at following two different methods for treating income in the analysis which give different results. In the
        first case, average income generated from investment is taken after deduction of depreciation charge.
        In second case, the original cost is taken as denominator rather than average investment. This gives the
        simple yearly rate of return. This is based on “bigger and better” principle. This criterion can be applied
        either against average investment in the year selected for study or simply against initial cost.
		 In other words, a Rate of Return (ROR) is the gain or loss of an investment over a certain period of time.
   In other words, the rate of return is the gain (or loss) compared to the cost of an initial investment,
   typically expressed in the form of a percentage. When the ROR is positive, it is considered a gain, and
   when the ROR is negative, it reflects a loss on the investment.
		 The standard formula for calculating ROR is as follows:

                               Ending Value of Investment – Beginning Value of Investment
        Rate of Return =                                                                          *100
                                               Beginning Value of Investment


		Example:
         1. Amit is a retail investor and decides to purchase 10 shares of Company A at a per-unit price of
            $20. Adam holds onto shares of Company A for two years. In that time frame, Company A paid
            yearly dividends of $1 per share. After holding them for two years, Adam decides to sell all 10
            shares of Company A at an ex-dividend price of $25. Adam would like to determine the rate of
            return during the two years he owned the shares.
 Solution:
		
		 To determine the rate of return, first, calculate the amount of dividends he received over the two-
   year period:


430
Introduction (Financial Management)                                                                  LESSON 11

		 10 shares x ($1 annual dividend x 2) = $20 in dividends from 10 shares
		 Next, calculate how much he sold the shares for:
		 10 shares x $25 = $250 (Gain from selling 10 shares)
		 Lastly, determine how much it cost Adam to purchase 10 shares of Company A:
		 10 shares x $20 = $200 (Cost of purchasing 10 shares)
		 Plug all the numbers into the rate of return formula:
		 = (($250 + $20 – $200) / $200) x 100 = 35%
 Therefore, Adam realized a 35% return on his shares over the two-year period.
		
		 Further, it is also essential to comprehend the concept of Annualized Rate of Return also. The
   annualized ROR, also known as the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), is the return of an
   investment over each year.
		 The formula for annualized ROR is as follows:
                                                                                         1/n
                                                                   Ending Value 
                                      Annualized Rate of Return =                             -1
                                                                   Beginning Value 
		
        Similar to the simple rate of return, any gains made during the holding period of this investment should
        be included in the formula.

		 Example: Let’s assume that an individual placed their money into two different investment products:

          1. A $100,000 investment into a high-interest savings account with a variable interest rate. With no
             additional contributions, six years later, the account balance amounts to $115,900.

          2.   An investment property in Miami that was bought for $350,000 in 2015. Five years later, the
               property is now worth $410,000.

		 With two completely different investments, which one provides the best return? We can use the
   annualized rate of return formula to calculate the rate of return for both investments on an annual
   basis.

		 Using the formula given above, we substitute the figures:

                1)   ARR = (115,900 / 100,000) (1/6) – 1

		 ARR = 0.02489 ≈ 2.50%

                2)   ARR = (410,000 / 350,000) (1/5) – 1

		 ARR = 0.03215 ≈ 3.21%

		 By using the annualized rate of return formula, we are now able to compare the returns for both
   investments over the same time frame. Therefore, we can conclude that the investment property in
   Miami provides the best return at an annualized rate of 3.21%.

   4.   Undiscounted benefit-cost ratio: It is the ratio between the aggregate benefits and the cost of project.
        Benefits are taken at face value. The ratio may be “gross” or “net”. It is “gross” when calculated with
        benefits without deducting depreciation. In the net version, depreciation is deducted from benefits

                                                                                                            431
EP-CA&FM                                                                           Introduction (Financial Management)

        before computing the results. Both ratios give identical ranking. Net ratio equals the gross ratio minus
        1. This relationship makes it simple to calculate gross ratio and then to arrive at net ratio.

		 This criterion is compatible with the “bigger and better” principle. But it does not follow the second
   principle of “bird in hand” as early receipts are given identical weights to later receipts in the project’s
   life.

   5.   Discounted benefit-cost ratio: This ratio is more reliable as it is based on present value of future benefits
        and costs. It may also be gross or net like the one discussed earlier. It takes into account all incomes
        whenever received and to this extent complies with “bigger and better” principle. Early receipts are
        given more weight than late receipts on account of introduction of discount factor.

		 This ratio satisfies the requirements of both the principles and is a good criterion for decision making.

		 Example of Benefit Cost Ratio:

		 Cash flow projections for a project are provided below. The relevant discount rate is 10%.

                Time                   t=0                   t=1                   t=2                    t=3

                Costs                -$5000               -$10,000              -$10,000                -$15,000

              Benefits                  -                      -                $50,000                 $75,000

           Net Cash Flow             -$5000               -$10,000              $40,000                 $60,000

		 What is the benefit-cost ratio of the project?

   6.   Present value method: This concept is useful as a decision criterion because it reveals the fact that the
        value of money is constantly declining, as a rupee received today is more in value than the rupee at the
        end of a year. Besides, if the rupee is invested today it will fetch a return on investment and accumulate
        to Re. 1 (1+i) at the end of ‘n’ period. Hence a rupee received at the end of ‘n’ period is worth 1/(1+i)n now.
        Investment decisions require comparison of present value with the cost of assets, and if the present
        value exceeds the cost, the investment is rendered acceptable. The practical application of concept of
        time value of money would be discussed in lesson 12.
		 Another off-shoot of this criterion is net present value method which is closely related to cost-benefit
   ratio. It takes into account all income and its timing with appropriate weights. Here difference of present
   value of benefits and costs is considered as against the ratio in cost-benefit analysis. This criterion

         is useful for acceptance of projects showing positive net present value at the company’s cost of
         capital rate. It can be used for choosing between mutually exclusive projects by considering whether
         incremental investment yields a positive net present value.

		Example

		 Company A ltd wanted to know their net present value of cash flow if they invest 100000 today. And
   their initial investment in the project is 80000 for the 3 years of time, and they are expecting the rate of
   return is 10 % yearly. From the above available information, calculate the NPV.

		Solution:

		NPV = Cash flow / (1 + i)t – initial investment

		 = 100000/(1-10)3-80000

		NPV = 57174.21

		 So in this example, NPV is positive, so we can accept the project.

    7.   Internal rate of return: It It is a widely used criterion for investment decisions. It takes interest factor
         into account. It is known as marginal efficiency of capital or rate of return over cost. It stipulates rate of
         discount which will equate the present value of the net benefits with the cost of the project. This method
         satisfies both these principles and would be elaborated with practical examples in Chapter 12.

		Example:

		 Let us say a company has an option to replace its machinery.

		 The cost and return are as follows:

		 Initial investment = Rs.5,00,000

		 Incremental increase per year = Rs.2,00,000

		 Replacement value = Rs.45,270

		 Life of asset = 3 years

		 If we assume IRR to be 13%, the computation will be as follows.

		Solution:

		 The total of the column Discounted Cash Flows approximately sums up to zero making the NPV equal
   to Zero. Hence, this discounted rate is the best rate. As can be seen from the above, using the rate of
   13%, the cash flows, both positive and negative become minimum.
		 Hence, it is the best rate of return on investment. The cost of capital of the company is 10%. Since the
   IRR is higher than the cost of capital, the project can be selected.
		 If the company has another opportunity to invest the money in a project that gives a 12% return, the
   company will still go in for the machinery replacement since it gives the highest IRR.

 Capital Structure
The capital structure of a corporate unit contains two important parameters viz., the owners’ capital known as
equity and the debt which represents interest of debenture holders in the assets of the company. The factors
responsible for inclusion of debt in the capital structure of a company are tax-savings, easier to sell, lower cost
of floatation and services, lower cost of capital, the advantage of leverage, no dilution of equity and probable
loss of control, logical to consolidate and fund short-term indebtedness by a bond issue, advantageous in the
inflationary trends of rising interest rates and improvement in financial ratios.
There is no alternative for a company to equity financing to meet its requirement for funds. Debt can be raised
by a company only on an adequate equity base which serves as a cushion for debt financing. The study of
effect of leverage is the main focus point to determine the best mix of debt and equity sources of funds. It is,
therefore, desired to consider this criterion for financing decision making in relation to leverage and cost of
capital.

 VALUE OF FIRM-RISK AND RETURN
Financial decisions incur different degree of risk. An investor’s decision to invest in risk free government
bonds has less risk as interest rate is known and the risk of default is very less. On the other hand, an investor
would incur more risk if he decides to invest in shares, as the return is not certain. However, the investor
can expect a lower return from government bond and higher from shares. Risk and expected return move in
tandem; the greater the risk the greater would be the expected return. The following figure shows the risk-
return relationship.

                                          The Risk-return relationship
As discussed earlier, a finance manager has to take various types of decision- investment decisions, financing
decisions and dividend decisions. A finance manager takes these decisions in the light of the objective of wealth
maximisation as reflected in the market price of the shares. The finance manager should also know as to what

434
Introduction (Financial Management)                                                                      LESSON 11

are the factors which may affect the market price of the shares. The various decisions will be taken in the light
of these factors, otherwise any attempt to achieve the objective of maximisation of market price of the shares
may not be achieved.
A finance manager cannot avoid the risk altogether nor he takes a decision by considering the return aspect
only. Usually, as the return from an investment increases, the risk associated with it also increases. In an attempt
to increase the return, the finance manager will have to undertake greater degree of risk also. Therefore, a
finance manager is often required to trade-off between the risk and return. At the time of taking any decision, the
finance manager tries to achieve the proper balance between the consideration of risk and return associated
with various financial management decisions to maximise the market value of the firm. A particular combination
of risk and return where both are optimized may be known as Risk-return trade off and at this level of risk-return,
the market price of the shares will be maximised.
The figure below demonstrates the relationship between market value of the firm, return and risk, on the one
hand and financial management decision on the other.




 LIQUIDITY
Liquidity is an important concept in financial management and is defined as ability of the business to meet its
short- term obligations. It shows the quickness with which a business/company can convert its assets into cash
to pay what it owes in the near future. According to Ezra Soloman, it measures a company’s ability to meet
expected as well as unexpected requirements of cash to expand its assets, reduce its liabilities and cover
up any operating losses. Liquidity, as a decision criterion, is widely used in financial management. It is used
for managing liquid resources or current assets or near cash assets so as to enhance the effectiveness with
which they are utilised with a view to minimising costs. It also focuses attention on the availability of funds.
Enhancement of liquidity enables a corporate body to have more funds from the market.
While using liquidity as a decision criterion, the management makes use of ratios. They give a bird’s eye view
of the current liquidity position or shortages thereof. A company will like to have liquid resources for transaction
purposes, as a precautionary measure and for speculative opportunities. The management’s attitude towards
these i.e., transaction motive, precautionary motive and speculative motive (taking advantage of lower prices of
raw materials etc., in the market) is an important determinant of a company’s liquidity position.
Liquidity is assessed through the use of ratio analysis. Liquidity ratios provide an insight into the present cash
solvency of a firm and its ability to remain solvent in the event of calamities.
Current Ratio which is the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, is widely used by corporate units to judge
the ability to discharge short-term liabilities covering the period upto one year. The interpretation of the current
ratio is that ‘higher the ratio, greater is the ability of the firm to pay off its bills’.

                                                                                                                435
EP-CA&FM                                                                        Introduction (Financial Management)

Nevertheless, it is a crude ratio and does not take into account the difference amongst different categories
of assets. For example, inventory may not be turned into cash as quickly as Account Receivables. The main
difficulty that arises in treating inventory as a quick item is that unless one has ensured about the quality,
condition and marketability of the inventory it may be impossible to turn it into cash immediately at the estimated
value. Therefore, to assess quick liquidity position, inventory is excluded while calculating Quick Ratio. The
ingredients of current assets while computing the Quick Ratio are cash, marketable securities and receivables.
Besides cash, the other two items are near cash and at very short notice can easily be converted into cash.
Therefore, for taking financial decisions particularly for assessing cash position of the company and its ability
to discharge current obligations, Quick Ratio is frequently relied upon. Nevertheless, the main shortcoming of
the Quick Ratio is that it ignores inventories and concentrates on cash, marketable securities and receivables in
relation to current obligations although inventory is also a basic input in current ratio without which company’s
decision process cannot be complete.
Liquidity ratio enables a company to assess its Net Working Capital. Working Capital is denoted by the
combination of current assets or current liabilities of a company, and for calculation of net working capital we
deduct current liabilities from current assets. Having done so we are left with the ready money in our hands to
meet day to day needs of the business. If we still want to know as to how much is available with the company
per rupee of sales then Net Working Capital is divided by sales.
Tailor-made measurement can be devised for calculating liquidity ratio in different situations. For example, the
principle of liquidity can be extended to study liquidity of receivables (or inventories) separately to enable the
executives to take decisions about the collection period of bills.
Liquidity of receivables is assessed through Average Collection Period (ACP). ACP tells us the average number
of days receivables are outstanding i.e., the average time a bill takes to convert into cash. The inverse to this
ratio is Receivables Turnover Ratio (RTR). Either of the two ratios can be used as both depict the slowness of
recovery, but the readings are different. For financial decisions and to use liquidity as criterion the average
collection period ratio, and receivables turnover ratio is used to help in taking corrective steps for maintaining
the optimum liquid position for the company at any given time to avoid risk of losing goodwill and chances of
bankruptcy. The ratio, in short, reveals the following results:
   (1)     Too low an average collection period may suggest excessively restricted credit policy of a company.
   (2)     Too high an average collection period (ACP) may indicate too liberal a credit policy. A large number of
           receivables may remain due and outstanding, resulting in less profits and more chances of bad debts.
Average collection period and receivables turnover ratio should be compared to the average age of accounts
payable or accounts payable turnover ratio. Though adequate liquidity could be maintained by accelerating
collections and deferring payments, yet this has its own limitations and drawbacks. It affects the credit standing
of the company in business and banking circles.
In the same spirit, decisions are made to maintain a proper inventory level in the company. For the purpose, it
becomes essential to assess the liquidity of inventory. Inventory Turnover Ratio i.e., cost of goods sold divided
by average annual inventory, shows the rapidity with which inventory is turned into receivables through sales.
The higher the ratio, the more efficient is the inventory management system of the company.
To conclude, liquidity, as a decision criterion is an important tool in financial management. Financial decisions
are affected by liquidity analysis of a company in the following areas:
      1.   Management of cash and marketable securities;
   2.      Credit policy of a firm and procedures for realisation;
   3.      Management and control of inventories;


436
Introduction (Financial Management)                                                                              LESSON 11

       4.    Administration of fixed assets;
       5.    Taking decisions for efficient use of current assets at minimum cost; and
       6.    Decisions to keep the company’s position on sound basis to avoid eventualities.
The above analysis of liquidity suggests evaluation of current assets of a company. On liabilities side also,
liquidity position is analysed and managed through assessment of long and medium term debts of the company,
and the arrangements for their repayments. This is done purely from the precautionary point of view so that the
company could be saved from the risk of bankruptcy for non-payment of its debt to the lenders.

 PROFITABILITY
Profitability as a decision criterion is another important tool in financial management for taking decisions from
different angles after evaluating the performance of the company in different spheres. For example, if it becomes
essential for the company to examine profit per unit of sale then it is done by estimating profitability per rupee of
sales. It is used as a measure of comparison and standard of performance. Similarly, there could be other ratios.
Because different users look at the profitability of a company from different angles, they use different ratios.
Short-term creditors, long-term lenders, equity shareholders, investors, etc. all are interested in profitable
operations of a concern. They use the ratios which best suit their requirements. Profitability can be related to
sales or to total capital employed or to net worth of the company. But then different figures for profits are taken
into account.
Profitability to sales ratio, reflects the company’s ability to generate profits per unit of sales. If sales lack sufficient
margin of profit, it is difficult for the business enterprise to cover its fixed cost, including fixed charges on debt, and to
earn profit for shareholders. From investors point of view profits are compared by the investors as percentage to the
capital employed in the business enterprise. Absence of adequate profitability ratio on sales reflects the company’s
inability to utilise assets effectively. This is analysed through the asset turnover ratio.
One of the important profitability ratios is profits on equity – profit figure after interest, before dividend and
taxes, drawn from the profit and loss account is related to the equity of the shareholders as shown in balance
sheet. This is an indicator of profits earned on funds invested by the owners. It is an indicator of actual returns
received by them. This ratio may assume two forms:

            Earning available to common shareholders
 (1)
                           Total Equity

            Net income after tax
 (2)
                Total Equity
[The ratio at (2) is used where the company has no preference shareholders].
Profit margin is another measure of viewing profitability. The revenue bearing property of sales can be easily
assessed from the profit margin. It is derived by dividing operating income from business by sales. This ratio
indicates the efficiency of operations as well as how products are priced. Inadequacy of profit margin is
an evidence of company’s inability to achieve satisfactory results. Pricing decisions are made by financial
executives in consultation with the marketing departments of the company. Policy decisions relating to increase
or decrease in price are taken in respect of different products keeping in view the competitiveness of the
market. Profit margin ratio is constantly used by business executives for this purpose. To look into the cash
generating capacity of sales, gross profit margin is used by deducting the cost of goods sold from sales and
dividing by sales.
The gross profit margin ratio indicates the profits relative to sales after deduction of direct production cost. It

                                                                                                                         437
EP-CA&FM                                                                          Introduction (Financial Management)

indicates efficiency of production operations and the relationship between production costs and selling price.
The difference between the above two ratios i.e. gross profit margin and net profit margin ratios is that general
and administrative expenses are excluded while computing gross margin. Thus, net profit margin ratio is
calculated as under:

                                Net Profit after Taxes
Net Profit Margin (NPM) =
                                        Sales
NPM ratio is an indicator of company’s ability to generate profits after paying all taxes and expenses. Decline in
this ratio reflects the presence of either higher expenses relative to sales or higher tax burden on the company,
affecting its profitability adversely. For assessment of profitability as a decision criterion return on investment
(ROI) is a frequently used ratio.
Return on Investment: This is an important profitability ratio from the angle of shareholders and reflects on the
ability of management to earn a return on resources put in by the shareholders. The beauty of the ROI ratio is
that earning of the company can be viewed from different angles so as to take decisions on different causes
responsible, to reduce or to enhance the profitability of the company. One way of finding out rate of return
on assets employed in the company is to find the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to capital
employed. This ratio indicates operating income to the assets used to produce income.
Another way of computing the ratio of return is through the assets turnover ratio and margin of profit which gives
the same results, as EBIT to capital employed. It may be seen from the following:

                                     EBIT                Sales            EBIT
                                                x                  =
                                     Sales               Assets          Assets
A high ratio indicates efficient use of assets and low ratio reflects inefficient use of assets by a company.
Another off-shoot of profitability ratio is the times interest earned ratio, which gives a clue to the interest
bearing capacity of the income character of business operations. This ratio relates operating profits to fixed
charges created by the company’s borrowings, and provides an indication of margin of safety between financial
obligations and Net income after tax. A company may earn profits but may find it difficult to make payments
of excess interest charges or may face inability to meet such obligations. EBIT should be 5 to 6 times interest
charges as a satisfactory guideline for this ratio. Lenders, particularly banks and financial institutions, greatly
rely on this ratio particularly in profitability assessment through projections of income of the borrower in the
coming years after investment of borrowed funds.
In this way, we find that profitability as decision making criterion in financial management, is crucial for business
managers. Business works as a system comprised of sub-systems. Different criteria assess different aspects
and assist in viewing different situations which have an aggregate impact on business activity, and therefore
form the basis of financial management.
There is an inverse relationship between liquidity and profitability. While the immediate survival of a business
depends on its liquidity, its long term survival and growth depend on profitability. Thus, liquidity ensures short
term survival and profitability ensures long term survival. Both are, therefore important for any firm to survive. A
firm should maintain a trade-off situation where the firm maintains its optimum liquidity for greater profitability
and the finance executive has to strike a balance between the two conflicting objectives. Therefore we can say
that Liquidity and Profitability are competing goals for the finance manager.

Examples of Return on Investment
1. Vegan Steaks had the best year ever, with sales of $4,500,000 and operating profit of $950,000. The
balance sheet at the beginning of the year showed assets used in production with a cost of $20,000,000 and

438
Introduction (Financial Management)                                                                    LESSON 11

accumulated depreciation of $5,000,000. The company didn’t buy any assets during the year but did have
depreciation expense of $1,000,000. Calculate the ROI for the year.
Solution:
Beginning of the year book value:
20,000,000 – 5,000,000 = 15,000,000
End of year book value:
20,000,000 – (5,000,000 + 1,000,000) = 14,000,000
So, the average book value of assets is $14,500,000.

  950,000
                   =.0655
 14,500,000
or ROI of 6.55%.
2. Management of It’ll Heal Medical Company are evaluating the performance of three divisions of the company.
The Booboo Division had operating profit of $499 and on average used assets with a book value of $6,238. The
Splint Division had operating profit of $350 and used average assets of $3,889. The Intensive Care Division had
operating profit of $570 and average assets of $9,500. Which division is performing the best?
Solution:
The Splint Division is performing the best with an ROI of 9%. ROI is a good way to compare divisions of different
sizes. You calculate ROI as operating profit divided by average assets.

   499
             =.08
  6,238
or 8% ROI for the Booboo Division.

  350
            =.09
 3,889
or 9% ROI for the Splint Division.

  570
            =.06
 9,500
or 6% ROI for the Intensive Care Division.

 COSTING AND RISK
In financial management, costing relates to the system adopted for assessing cost of capital from various
sources viz., equity and preference shares, debentures/bonds, long-term borrowings from financial institutions,
etc. Equity capital is owner’s money employed in the business whereas borrowed funds are creditors’ funds
carrying an interest obligation and repayment schedule. There are thus, risks involved if interest is not paid
or on account of default in repayment of principal. It is ordinarily expected that every rupee obtained on loan
enhances the chances of increasing the returns on owners’ capital and the net worth. The rate of interest
on borrowed funds is usually lower than the returns expected by the investors or risk-takers in the business.
Moreover, interest paid is deductible for tax purposes. The following illustration gives an idea of the phenomenon

But if the company is not able to earn sufficient returns, the returns on owners’ funds are reduced and risk
increases. Using borrowed funds or fixed cost funds in the capital structure of a company is called financial
gearing. High financial gearing will increase the earnings per share of a company if earnings before interest
and taxes are rising, as compared to the earnings per share of a company with low or no financial gearing. It
may be understood that leverage and gearing are used interchangeably (the former is used in USA and the
latter in U.K.).
So at times when the economy is doing well, the shareholders of a highly geared company will do better than
the shareholders of a low geared company. However, if the company is not doing well, when its profits before
interest and taxes are falling, the earnings per share of highly geared company will fall faster than those of the
low geared company. The higher this level of financial gearing, the greater the risk. Those who take risk should
appreciate that in difficult times their reward will be below average but in good times they will receive above
average rewards. The lower the levels of financial gearing, the more conservative are the financial policies of
the company and the less will be deviations over time to earnings per share.
Risk is associated with fixed charges in the shape of interest on debt capital. Higher the fixed charges, the
greater the chance that it will not be covered by earnings and so greater the risk. Large companies financed
by heavy borrowings, need to continue to produce and search for new markets for their output. Any internal
disturbance or external constraint that may hamper the company’s production and sales will reduce inflow of
funds but fixed interest charges have to be paid. A study of the effects of capital gearing on cost of capital is
quite important for financial decisions. Given that a company has to minimise the cost of capital, it should fix up
a level of gearing where is costs of capital is minimum.
As against the traditional theory of capital structure suggesting that the average cost of capital does depends
on the level of gearing, the alternative theory on cost of capital as propounded by Modigliani and Miller argues
that the cost of capital is independent of the capital structure. The essence of the Modigliani and Miller argument

is the arbitrage process. Should the value of two firms with identical incomes and the same risk class ratios
vary (which would be possible under the traditional theory) the investors would arbitrage so as to make the
market value of the two firms equal. A key assumption of the model is that the investors can arbitrage between
companies, and between loan and equity capital, without increasing the risk of their individual investment
portfolios. The above theories would be discussed in detail in lesson 3.
Despite all the above theoretical explanations the fact remains that debt is associated with risk which enhances
with increase in the leverage. There are two major reasons for this increased risk viz., (1) interest is a fixed charge
and is required to be paid by the company whether or not it earns profits; and (2) a substantial decrease in
liquidity or increased demands from creditors for payment if the company has higher proportion of debt capital
in its capital structure. For these reasons, the risk of a company not being able to meet its obligations is greater
than in the case of a company in which the proportion of borrowed sum is substantially smaller.
Distinction may be made between different types of risk to which an enterprise is exposed in the business
environment.
The risk which we have discussed is financial risk that arises in relation to owners’ return created by the utilization of
funds in the enterprise particularly fixed cost securities i.e. debt and preference shares. Financial risk is distinguished
from “business risks” which is associated with the chance of loss due to variability of return, in general, created by
the enterprise and as such it is known as operating risk. Operating risk is concerned with EBIT (earning before interest
and taxes) whereas financial risk is concerned with EAIT (earning after interest and taxes). If there is preference
capital then the financial risk is concerned with earnings available to ordinary (equity) shareholders after dividends
have been paid to preference shareholders. Financial risk encompasses the risk of possible insolvency and the
variability in the earnings on equity. In case the enterprise does not employ debt or preference capital there will be
no financial risk and over all risk for the firm will be low. It is only because of application of debt financing, that overall
risk increases and originates into financial risk to equity holders.
Broadly risks may be classified into systematic and unsystematic risks. Systematic risk is risk within the entire
system. This is the kind of risk that applies to an entire market, or market segment. All investments are affected
by this risk, for example risk of a government collapse, risk of war or inflation, or risk such as that of the 2008
credit crisis.
On the other hand, unsystematic risk is also as residual risk, specific risk or diversifiable risk. It is unique to a
company or a particular industry. For example strikes, lawsuits and such events that are specific to a company,
and can to an extent be diversified away by other investments.


 Examples of Systematic Risk (Undiversifiable Risk)
    l Changes in laws / regulations

    l Tax reforms

    l Interest rate hikes

    l Natural disasters (earthquakes, floods etc.)

    l Political instability and flight of capital

    l Changes in foreign policy

    l Volatility in currency values

    l Failure of banks (e.g. 2008 mortgage crisis)

    l Economic recessions

 Examples of Unsystematic (Diversifiable Risk)
   l The entry of a new competitor into a market

   l A company is forced to recall one of its products

   l A company is found to have prepared fraudulent financial statements

   l A union targets a company for an employee walkout

   l A foreign government expropriates the assets of a specific company

Besides, there are other types of risk which are related to investment decisions and not cost of financial sources
viz., purchasing power risk, market risk, interest rate risk, social risk, regulatory risk and other risks. A brief
description of the mentioned risks are as under:
   a)      Purchasing Power Risk: Inflation risk, also referred to as purchasing power risk, is the risk that inflation
           will undermine the real value of cash flows made from an investment. Inflation risk can be seen clearly
           with fixed-income investments.
   b)      Market Risk: Market risk is the possibility that an individual or other entity will experience losses due to
           factors that affect the overall performance of investments in the financial markets.
   c)      Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the potential for investment losses that result from a change in
           interest rates. If interest rates rise, for instance, the value of a bond or other fixed-income investment will
           decline.
   d)      Social Risk: Social risk for a business includes actions that affect the communities around them. Examples
           include labor issues, human rights violations within the workforce, and corruption by company officials.
   e)      Regulatory risk: Regulatory is the risk that a change in regulations or legislation will affect a security,
           company, or industry. Companies must abide by regulations set by governing bodies that oversee their
           industry. Therefore, any change in regulations can cause a rippling effect across an industry.
      f)   Reputation Risk: Reputational risk is a threat or danger to the good name or standing of a business or
           entity. Reputational risk can occur in the following ways:
               Directly, as the result of the actions of the company itself
               Indirectly, due to the actions of an employee or employees
               Tangentially, through other peripheral parties, such as joint venture partners or suppliers
   g)      Operational Risk: This business risk can happen internally, externally or involve a combination of factors.
           Something could happen unexpectedly resulting into closure of business operations. Unexpected event
           could be a natural disaster or fire that may cause substantial damage to the business resulting into its
           closure of operations.
   h)      Competition Risk: While a business may be aware that there is always some competition in their
           industry, it’s easy to miss out on what businesses are offering that may appeal to the customers. In
           this case, the business risk involves a company leader becoming so comfortable with their success
           and the status quo that they don’t look for ways to pivot or make continual improvements. Increasing
           competition combined with an unwillingness to change may result in a loss of customers.

 OBJECTIVES OF A FIRM
Financial management of any business firm has to set goals for itself and to interpret them in relation to the
objective of the firm. Broadly, there are two objectives a business firm viz.

Introduction (Financial Management)                                                                     LESSON 11

   (a)    Profit maximisation;
   (b)    Shareholder Wealth maximisation.

 (a) Profit Maximisation
According to Solomon, Price system directs managerial efforts towards more profitable goods or services.
Prices are determined by the demand and supply conditions as well as the competitive forces, and they guide
the allocation of resources for various productive activities.
In economic theory, the behavior of the firm is analysed in terms of profit maximization. The classical economic
view of the firm, as put forward by Hayek (1950) and Fredman (1970), is that it should be operated in a manner
that maximizes its profit. This occurs, in economic terms, when marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Profit
maximization means that a firm either produces maximum output for a given amount of input, or uses minimum
input for producing a given output. The underlying rationale of profit maximization is efficiency. It is assumed
that profit maximisation causes the efficient allocation of resources under the competitive market condition, and
profit is considered as the most appropriate measure of a firm’s performance.
Thus, profit maximisation is considered as an important goal in financial decision-making in an organisation. It
ensures that firm utilizes its available resources most efficiently under conditions of competitive markets.
But in recent years, under the changed corporate environment, profit maximisation is regarded as unrealistic,
difficult, inappropriate and socially not much preferred goal for business organisation. It is argued that profit
maximisation assumes perfect competition, and in the face of imperfect modern markets, it cannot be a legitimate
objective of the firm. It is also argued that the objective of profit maximisation as a business objective developed
in the 19th century when the business activity was self financing and based on assumption of private property
and single entrepreneurship. The only aim of the entrepreneur then was to maximize his profit and enhance
his own wealth, this objective could be easily satisfied by profit maximisation objective. The modern business
environment is characterised by limited liability and a distinction between management and ownership. The
various stakeholders of the firm are shareholder, lenders, customers, employees, government and society. In
practice the objectives of all these stakeholders may differ and may even conflict with each other. The manager
has a difficult task of reconciling and balancing these conflicting objectives. The goal of profit maximization
overlooks the interest of other parties than the shareholders and is therefore crticised and considered as
unrealistic, inappropriate and immoral.
Profit maximisation as corporate goal is criticised by scholars mainly on the following grounds:
    (i)   It is vague conceptually.
   (ii)   It ignores timing of returns.
  (iii)   It ignores the risk factor.
  (iv)    It may tempt to make such decisions which may in the long run prove disastrous.
   (v)    Its emphasis is generally on short run projects.
  (vi)    It may cause decreasing share prices.
  (vii)   The profit is only one of the many objectives and variables that a firm considers.

 (b) Shareholder Wealth Maximisation
According to Solomon, shareholder wealth maximization means maximizing the net present value of a course
of action to shareholders. Net present value (NPV) or wealth of a course of action is the difference between the
present value of its benefit and the present value of its costs.

                                                                                                                443
EP-CA&FM                                                                         Introduction (Financial Management)

Presently, maximisation of present value (or wealth) of a course of action is considered appropriate operationally
flexible goal for financial decision-making in an organisation. The net present value or wealth can be defined
more explicitly in the following way:

               Rt
NPV =
             (I + i) t
Where,
NPV = Net Present Value
Rt = Net cash flow at time t
i = Discount
t = time value of the cash flow
The management of an organisation tries to maximise the present value not only for shareholders but for other
stakeholders too, i.e., employees, customers, suppliers and community at large. This goal for the maximum
present value is generally justified on the following grounds:
      (i)   It is consistent with the object of maximising owners economic welfare.
   (ii)     It focuses on the long run.
  (iii)     It takes into account various forms of risks.
  (iv)      It recognises the value of regular dividend payments.
   (v)      It takes into account time value of money.
  (vi)      It maintains market price of its shares.
  (vii)     It seeks growth in sales and earnings.
However, profit maximisation can be part of a wealth maximisation strategy. Quite often two objectives can be
pursued simultaneously but the maximisation of profit should never be permitted to overshadow the objectives
of wealth maximisation.
The objective of the firm provides a framework for optimal decision making in the area of business management.
The term ‘objective’ should be used in the sense of ‘decision criteria’ for taking decisions involved in financial
management. It means that what is relevant is not the overall objective of the business but operationally useful
criterion against which the investment, financing and dividend policy decisions are to be judged. The objective
of shareholder wealth maximisation is an appropriate and operationally feasible criterion to choose among the
alternative financial actions.
It provides an unambiguous measure of what financial management should seek to maximise in making
investment and financing decisions on behalf of shareholders. Another point to note in this context is that
objective provide a ‘normative’ framework. In other words, it implies that the focus is on what a firm should try
to achieve and on policies that it should follow if the objectives are to be achieved.

How to Create Shareholder Value
In order to maximize shareholder value, there are three main strategies for driving profitability in a company: (1)
revenue growth, (2) increasing operating margin, and (3) increasing capital efficiency.

    1.   Revenue Growth: For any goods and services businesses, sales revenue can be improved through the
         strategies of sales volume increase or sales price inflation.
          i)    Increasing Sales Volume
		 A company would want to retain its current customers and keep them away from competitors to
   maintain its market share. It should also attract new customers through referrals from existing
   customers, marketing and promotions, new products and services offerings, and new revenue
   streams.
          ii)   Raising Sales Price
		 A company may increase current product prices as a one-time strategy or gradual price increases
   throughout several months, quarters, or years to achieve revenue growth. It can also offer new
   products with advanced qualities and features and price them at higher ranges. Ideally, a business
   can combine both higher volume and higher prices to significantly increase revenue.
   2.    Operating Margin
		 Besides maximizing sales, a business must identify feasible approaches to cost reductions leading
   to optimal operating margins. While a company should strive to reduce all its expenses, COGS (Cost
   of Goods Sold) and SG&A (Selling, General, and Administrative) expenses are usually the largest
   categories that need to be efficiently managed and minimized.
          i) Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
		 When a company builds a good relationship with its suppliers, it can possibly negotiate with

                                                                                                     445
EP-CA&FM                                                                       Introduction (Financial Management)

               suppliers to reduce material prices or receive discounts on large orders. It may also form a long-
               term agreement with the suppliers to secure its material source and pricing.
		 Many companies use automation in their manufacturing processes to increase efficiency in
   production. Automation not only reduces labor and material costs, but also improves the quality
   and precision of the products and, thus, largely reduces defective and return rates. Return
   management is the process by which activities associated with returns and reverse logistics are
   managed. It is an important factor in cost reduction because a good return management process
   helps the company manage the product flow efficiently and identify ways to reduce undesired
   returns by customers.
         ii)   Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses
		 SG&A is usually one of the largest expenses in a company. Therefore, being able to minimize
   them will help the company achieve an optimal operating margin. The company should tightly
   control its marketing budget when planning for next year’s spending. It should also carefully
   manage its payroll and overhead expenses by evaluating them periodically and cutting down on
   unnecessary labor and other costs. Shipping cost is directly associated with product sales and
   returns. Therefore, good return management will help reduce the cost of goods sold as well as
   logistics costs.
   3.   Capital Efficiency
		 Capital efficiency is the ratio between dollar expenses incurred by a company and dollars that are
   spent to make a product or service, which can be referred to as ROCE (Return on Capital Employed)
   or the ratio between EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Tax) over Capital Employed. Capital efficiency
   reflects how efficiently a company is deploying its cash in its operations.
		 Capital employed is the total amount of capital a company uses to generate profit, which can be
   simplified as total assets minus current liabilities. A higher ROCE indicates a more efficient use of capital
   to generate shareholder value, and it should be higher than the company’s capital cost.
          i) Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E)
		 To achieve high capital efficiency, a company would first want to achieve a high return on assets
   (ROA), which measures the company’s net income generated by its total assets.
		 Over time, the company might also shift to developing proprietary technology, which is a system,
   application, or tool owned by a company that provides a competitive advantage to the owner. The
   company can then profit from utilizing this asset or licensing the technology to other companies.
   Proprietary technology is an optimal asset to possess because it increases capital efficiency to a
   great extent.
         ii)   Inventory
		 Inventory is often a major component of a company’s total assets, and a company would always
   want to increase its inventory turnover, which equals net sales divided by average inventory. A
   higher inventory turnover ratio means that more revenues are generated given the amount of
   inventory. Increasing inventory turnover also reduces holding costs, consisting of storage space
   rent, utilities, theft, and other expenses. It can be achieved by effective inventory management,
   which involves constant monitoring and controlling of inventory orders, stocks, returns, or obsolete
   items in the warehouse.
		 Inventory buying efficiency can be greatly improved by using the Just-in-time (JIT) system. Costs
   are only incurred when the inventory goes out and new orders are being placed, which allows
   companies to minimize costs associated with keeping and discarding excess inventory.

 Ethics of Shareholder Wealth Maximization
There is an idea that businesses focused on money are greedy and don’t care about social issues or that
socially responsible businesses can’t increase stock values. But a company can be both profitable and socially
responsible.
Consider the 2008 Great Recession and one of its main causes, the subprime mortgage crisis. These banks
were more concerned about their investment portfolios instead of properly loaning money to customers, which
is their charge. Those investment portfolios were filled with toxic assets, which eventually compromised the
operations of many financial institutions and caused the failure of several big banks. As a result, their share
prices fell right along with them. In this case, greed and a lack of social concern led to their downfall.
On the other hand, after almost failing during the Great Recession, automaker GM turned itself around,
strengthened its ability to withstand future recessions, and developed “greener” vehicles. As a result, it realized
an increase in its share price.

 PROFIT MAXIMISATION VERSUS SHAREHOLDER WEALTH MAXIMISATION
Profit maximisation is basically a single-period or, at the most, a short-term goal. It is usually interpreted to
mean the maximisation of profits within a given period of time. A firm may maximise its short-term profits at the
expense of its long-term profitability and still realise this goal. In contrast, shareholder wealth maximisation
is a long-term goal and shareholders are interested in future as well as present profits. Wealth maximisation
is generally preferred because it considers (1) wealth for the long-term, (2) risk or uncertainty, (3) the timing
of returns, and (4) the shareholders’ return. The following table provides a summary of the advantages and
disadvantages of these two often conflicting goals.

In other words, the conflict may emerge in the area of profit maximsation and wealth maximisation as an
objective of financial management. Profit maximisation would be a measure of attaining profit in a firm and
wealth maximisation would consider the effect of earning per share and dividend to shareholders. The objective
of wealth maximisation would be fulfilled by increasing the market price of shares through decisions on future
cashflow,dividends and earnings per shares but to maximise profit the financial manager may have to consider

                                                                                                               447

issues like – retained earnings, non-payment of dividends, investing funds in profitable outlets. The finance
manager has to try and maximise profit without in any way affecting the shareholders wealth because primary
goal of financial decision making is to achieve wealth maximisation. Profit maximisation is the narrow objective of
financial management because profit is a test of economic efficiency but wealth maximisation is comprehensive
objective of financial management, it goes beyond the quantitative aspects as it also considers qualitative
benefits in a firm. Wealth maximisation objective is therefore, superior to the profit maximisation concept.




 Advantages of Profit Maximisation Hypothesis
1. Prediction:
The profit-maximization hypothesis allows us to predict quite well the behaviour of business firms in the real
world. It does not matter that few firms are maximizers in reality. What matters is that they behave without too
much difficulty and with reasonable accuracy. Further Arguments for the Profit-Maximization Hypothesis.
2. Proper Explanation of Business Behaviour:
The economist relies on the profit- maximization hypothesis because it is useful in explaining and predicting
business behaviour.
3. Knowledge of Business Firms:
Profit motive is the most pervasive force that governs the behaviour of business firms. In the case of small firms
facing strong competition from others, they are forced to act as profit maximizers. They must do everything
possible to increase sales and reduce costs in order to survive in their competitive environment.
4. Simple Working: The profit-maximization hypothesis is simple, and there are well- developed mathematical
tools of analyzing maximization or minimization problems.
5. More Realistic:
Profit maximization is the single best assumption available and introduction of more “realistic” assumptions
complicates the analysis considerably without adding much to the predictive power of the model.

 Disadvantages of Profit Maximisation
1. Ambiguity in the Concept of Profit:
It has been pointed out that in the assumption of profit maximization; the concept of profit has never been
unambiguously stated. Is it rate of profit, total or net profits that a firm tends to maximize? The three concepts
have entirely different implications for price theory.

2. Multiplicity of Interests in a Joint Stock Company:
It is argued that with the ushering in of corporate form of enterprise, profit maximization goal has a considerably
reduced edge; other goals have come to the fore.
3. No Compulsion of Competition for a Monopolist:
As far as a monopolist goes he has no compulsions to maximize his profit. Since the monopolist ordinarily
earns above-normal returns, why should he maximize? In imperfectly competitive industries where barriers to
entry are effective, the firm ordinarily does not have to walk the tightrope of zero economic profits. Instead,
the existence of monopoly power provides wider range of various alternatives than order conditions of perfect
competition.
4. Separation of Ownership from Control:
Under the impact of managerial revolution, there has been a considerable divorce of ownership and control. In
modern, gigantic corporations little attempt is made either by individuals or by the groups to maximize profits.
Generally, the salaried managers cease to look for profits beyond the level which suffices to pay their salaries
and keep the shareholders quiet and the owners are powerless to remedy the situation. In a public corporation
set up by statute with no share but only loan capital, the divorce of ownership from control is as complete as
imaginable.
In such cases, it may be asked, what replaces profits in the mangers’ mind. In really very large firms, the
managers may only try to minimize costs and avoid losses but have no interest in increasing profits.
5. The Principle of Decreasing Power:
Keeping maximum business power is another common craze among organizers. It is seen in many cases that
growth of the firm through increased number of owners is profitable. But the existing owners are unwilling to
introduce any more partners.
This is because the greater the number of owners, the lesser is the power in each hand. The diminution of power
on account of the introduction of new partners is called the Principle of decreasing Power. In this way, most
entrepreneurs owning small firms have strong feeling to stick to a small firm and independent and exercise
unrestrained power rather than to invite new owners and enlarge their profits.
6. Stress on Efficiency, not Profit:
In particular cases some other motives become more important than profit maximizing. In many industries, the
manager’s aim is the attainment of some non-economic ideal of efficiency such as beauty, size, durability,
sharpness of product.
Managers pursue it not only for its own sake but for the good professional reputation it gives them in the trade.
In large multi-branch firms, the practice is common to encourage the branches to compete both in buying and
selling. Therefore, in place of profit, efficiency is given top priority.
7. Tendency of Following One Trade Only:
It is often seen that businessmen refrain from “integration or other forms of expansion not because they have
been calculated to be unprofitable but because “jack of all trades, master of none or some such proverbial
wisdom is always there.”
8. Conspicuous Consumption:
It should be noted that the firm is not only a producer but a consumer also. Often firms, to impress their clients
and various civil servants visiting it, indulge in what may be called Conspicuous consumption. In this regard it


                                                                                                               449
EP-CA&FM                                                                          Introduction (Financial Management)

may be noted that this kind of consumption does not go against profit-maximization; profits are first maximized
and then spent on non-essential goods. But if the firms indulge themselves, their investment policy cannot be
said to be dictated by profitability.
9. Legal Restrictions on Profit-Making:
In mixed developing economies like India, there are very many enterprises—public utilities, development
institutions etc. that are legally forbidden to maximize their profits.
Example – Wealth Maximisation
      l   Typical examples of wealth maximization can be the cases where the shareholders have benefited
          from investing in a particular stock over some time. Because the company’s net worth has grown,
          this has positively impacted the share values, too and thus increasing shareholders’ wealth. A very
          practical example can be an investment made in 1996 for a US-based company called Havells. It is
          observed that any investor who has invested in Havells to a tune of $1500 in this stock in 1996 and has
          retained the stock till now have seen a massive gain from a mere $1500 to $ 4,000,000.

 Advantages of Wealth Maximisation
Some of the advantages of wealth maximisation are as under:
      l   It is more related to cash flows than profits. Cash flows are more certain and regular, and there is a lack
          of uncertainty that otherwise is associated with profit.
      l   Profits are more manipulative, but cash flows are not. Thus, wealth maximization is less prone to
          manipulation than profit maximization, which relies on profit.
      l   It is more long-term-focused than profit maximization, which has a short-term focus. Profit maximization
          is easy to attain because managers may adopt unethical ways to bring short-term profits based on
          long-term sustainability.
      l   They consider risk and uncertainty factors while considering the discounting rate, which reflects both
          the time and risk.

 Disadvantages of Wealth Maximisation
Some of the disadvantages of wealth maximisation are as follows:
      l   It is more based on an idea that is prospective and not descriptive.
      l   The objectives laid in such a technique are not clear.
      l   Wealth maximization is largely dependent on the business’s profitability as only after the business is
          profitable can it think of enhancing the wealth of the shareholders.
      l   It is based on the generation of cash flows and not on the accounting profit
Wealth maximization has both merits and demerits attached to it. It is a very important factor for every investor
before one invests in a company. They bring about happiness by generating good returns to their shareholders,
and they tend to invest more in such companies, which may be required for their expansion or growth.

 Economic Value-Added (EVA) – A Criterion to Gauge Shareholder’s Value
The conventional approach to measure profit will deduct cost of loan capital in arriving at profit; but there is no
similar deduction for the cost of shareholders. Critics of the conventional approach point out that a business will
not make a profit, in an economic sense, unless it covers the cost of all capital invested, including shareholders’
funds. Earnings per share tells nothing about the cost of generating those profits. If the cost of capital (loans,
bonds, equity) as say, 15 per cent, then a 14 per cent earning is actually a reduction, not a gain, in economic
value. Profits also increase taxes, thereby reducing cash flow.
Return on assets is a more realistic measure of economic performance, but it ignores the cost of capital. Leading
firms can obtain capital at low costs, via favourable interest rates and high stock prices, which they can then
invest in their operations at decent rates of return on assets. This tempts them to expand without paying attention
to the real return, economic value-added.
Economic value added (EVA) is the after tax cash flow generated by a business minus the cost of the capital it has
deployed to generate that cash flow. Representing real profit versus paper profit, EVA underlines shareholder
value, increasingly the main target of leading companies strategies. Shareholders are the players who provide
the firm with its capital; they invest to gain a return on that capital.
The concept of EVA is well established in financial theory, buy only recently has the term moved into the
mainstream of corporate finance, as more and more firms adopt it as the base for business planning and
performance monitoring. There is growing evidence that EVA, not earnings, determines the value of a firm.
There is difference between EVA, earnings per share, return on assets, and discounted cash flow, as a measure
of performance.
Discounted cash flow is very close to economic value-added, with the discount rate being the cost of capital.
There are two key components to EVA. The net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) and the capital charge,
which is the cost of capital times the amount of capital. In other words, it is the total pool of profits available to
provide cash return to those who provided capital to the firm. The capital charge is the product of the cost of
capital times the capital tied up in the investment. In other words, the capital charge is the cash flow required to
compensate investors for the riskiness of the business given the amount of capital invested. On the one hand,
the cost of capital is the minimum rate of return on capital required to compensate debt and equity investors
for bearing risk-a cut-off rate to create value and capital is the amount of cash invested in the business, net of
depreciation (Dierks and Patel, 1997). In formula form,
                                  EVA = (Operating Profit) – (A Capital Charge)
                                      EVA = NOPAT – (Cost of Capital x Capital)
The functions of EVA can be understood from the following perspectives-
    i)   EVA as a Performance Measure : There is a continuous endeavor to develop a single measure that
         captures the overall performance, yet which is easy to calculate and is also economical. In order to
         achieve goal congruence, manager s compensation is often linked with the performance of the firm.
         Investors decide whether to invest in a firm, or to continue with the firm or to exit from it, only on the
         basis of overall performance of the firm. The only suitable solution to the above stated problems is
         ‘EVA’.
		 ROI, ROE and ROA gives us the rate of return earned by the firm with respect to capital invested in
   the firm. The most important limitation of these measures are derived from limitations inherent in the
   measurement of accounting profit. But these limitations are also associated with EVA. The difference
   lies only in the fact that the cost of equity is also factored to arrive at the residual income.
		       EVA stresses that in order to justify investments in the long run they have to produce at least a return that

                                                                                                                 451
EP-CA&FM                                                                            Introduction (Financial Management)

            covers the cost of capital as otherwise the shareholders would be better off investing elsewhere. This
            approach includes that the organization tries to operate without excess capital. While the accountants
            are familiar with the concept of residual value, its application in economic value measurement as a
            means of evaluating underlying business performance e is nothing short of an overhaul of traditional
            accounting concepts.
      ii)   EVA as a Corporate Philosophy: EVA, when implemented at every level of managerial decision making
            process, encourages managers to deploy resources only on value enhancing activities and to align
            the interests of shareholders with managers. This involves two things- one is linking managerial
            compensation package with EVA and second is to inculcate the culture of evaluating every action
            from the viewpoint that it should generate EVA. The ultimate out come should be enhancement in the
            shareholders wealth measured by the capital market.
		 The simplicity of EVA in communicating the very fundamental principle that only the generation of
   surplus over cost of capital can enhance shareholders wealth makes it a management technique
   superior to other planning and control techniques.
Problem: XYZ Ltd. has capital investment of ` 150 crores. After tax operating income is ` 20 crores and company
has a cost of capital of 12%. Estimate the Economic Value Added of the firm.
Solution: Capital employed 150 crores NOPAT= ` 20 crores
WACC          = 12 %
EVA           = NOPAT- (WACC-CE)
              = 20 – (12% x 150)
              = ` 2 crores
NOPAT - Net Operating Profit after Tax
WACC - Weighted Average Cost of Capital
CE- Capital Employed
Example
Say you made a ` 20,000 capital investment in your company. Your operating profit, after taxes, is ` 10,000. The
opportunity cost of that investment is 10%.
In this case EVA would be Net Operating Profit after taxes – Cost of Capital i.e. ` 10,000- 10% of ` 20,000 = `
8,000.
The goal of EVA is to take into account the cost of capital invested in the company.
Thus, EVA represents the value added to the shareholders by generating operating profits in excess of the cost
of capital employed in the business. EVA will increase if:
       i.   Operating profits grow without employing additional capital i.e., through greater efficiency.
      ii.   Additional capital is invested in the projects that give higher returns than the cost of procuring new
            capital, and
   iii.     Unproductive capital is liquidated i.e., curtailing the unproductive uses of capital.
Implementing EVA in a company is more than just patting one additional row in the income statement. It is of
course some kind of change process which should be given some management effort. However, if right actions
are taken straight from the beginning then implementing EVA should be one of the easiest change process that
a company goes through. The actions might include e.g.:

    –    Gaining the understanding and commitment of all the members of the management group through
         training and discussing and using this support prominently during the process.
    –    Training of the other employees, especially all the key persons.
    –    Adopting EVA in all levels of organization.
However, there are a few common mistakes that are often made in implementing or using EVA. Most of them
are bound up with either misunderstanding and thus misusing the concept at upper levels or not training all
the employees to use EVA and thus not using the full capacity of the concept. These common mistakes include
defining capital costs intentionally wrongly (usually too high for some reason), using EVA only in the upper
management level and investing too little in training of employees.

 Advantages of the Economic Value Added (EVA)
The following Some outstanding advantages of economic value added (EVA) below are:
    1.   EVA may be a tool that helps to focus managers’ attention on the impact of their decisions in increasing
         shareholders’ wealth.
   2.    EVA may be a good guide for investors; as on the bias of EVA, they will decide whether a specific
         company is worth investing money in or not. They can use as a basis for the valuation of goodwill and
         shares. Unlike accounting profit, like EBIT, net, and EPS, EVA Economic and predicate on the thought
         that a business must cover both the operating costs also because the capital costs and hence it presents
         a far better and true picture of the corporate to the owners, creditors, employees, shareholders, and
         everyone other interest parties.
   3.    EVA may be a good controlling device during a decentralized enterprise. Management can apply EVA
         to seek out the EVA contribution of every decentralized unit or segment of the corporate. It helps the
         corporate in monitoring the matter areas and hence taking corrective action to resolve those problems.
   4.    EVA can improve the company’s corporate governance because since a better EVA implies higher
         bonuses to the managers; they’re going to be working hard and also honestly; which successively
         augurs well for the corporate.
   5.    EVA helps the corporate owners identify the simplest person to run the corporate effectively and
         efficiently.

 Disadvantages of the Economic Value Added (EVA)
The following some outstanding disadvantages of economic value added (EVA) below are:
    1.   EVA does not take size differences into consideration. A plant or division that is larger in size will
         obviously have a higher EVA, in comparison to something that is smaller in size, which could distort
         your calculations and give you an inaccurate result.
   2.    EVA can be used for personal gains by the manager, which might not be particularly profitable for the firm.
   3.    EVA might overemphasize the immediate need to generate the results. It might put more emphasis on
         short-term gains than long-term ones.

 Interpreting the calculated EVA
When using EVA to assess the performance of an organisation or a division, the following should be considered:
    1.   Is it positive? If so, that is favourable, as it means that the organisation is providing a return that is
         greater than that required by providers of finance. It is creating wealth.


                                                                                                                453
EP-CA&FM                                                                       Introduction (Financial Management)

   2.   What is the trend over time? Is the calculated EVA increasing or not? Even if the trend is down, the
        organisation has still performed favourably if the calculated EVA is positive.
   3.   Reasons for changes in EVA also need to be investigated. For individual projects, EVA is only really
        meaningful when looking at the whole lifespan of a project. In the early years of a project’s life, when
        the net book value of the assets is higher, the finance charge may also be higher, leading to a lower
        value of EVA , whereas in later years the reverse is true.

 MARKET VALUE ADDED (MVA) – ANOTHER CRITERION TO GAUGE WEALTH MAXIMIZATION
Market value added (MVA) is a calculation that shows the difference between the market value of a company
and the capital contributed by all investors, both bondholders and shareholders. In other words, it is the sum of
all capital claims held against the company plus the market value of debt and equity. It is calculated as:
MVA = V – K
where MVA is the market value added of the firm, V is the market value of the firm, including the value of the
firm’s equity and debt (its enterprise value), and K is the total amount of capital invested in the firm.
Example-1
Calculate the market value added using the following information:
Total number of shares issued = 20,000,000
Number of shares held as treasury stock =1,100,000
Current share price = $35.5
Total invested capital plus retained earnings = $453,503,000
Cost of treasury stock = $39,050,000
Assume that the market value of debt equals its book value.
Solution
Number of Shares Outstanding = 20,000,000 − 1,100,000 = 18,900,000
Market Capitalization = 18,900,000 × $35.5 = $670,950,000
Total Shareholders’ Equity
= Total Invested Capital + Retained Earnings − Cost of Treasury Stock
= $453,503,000 − $39,050,000 = $414,453,000
Market Value Added for Shareholders = $670,950,000 − $414,453,000 = $256,497,000
Market Value Added for all Investors
= Market Value of Equity − Total Shareholders’ Equity + Market Value of Debt − Book Value of Debt
= $256,497,000 + 0 = $256,497,000
Example -2
Company XYZ whose shareholders’ equity amounts to $750,000. The company owns 5,000 preferred shares
and 100,000 common shares outstanding. The present market value for the common shares is $12.50 per share
and $100 per share for the preferred shares.

Market Value of Common Shares = 100,000 * $12.50 = $1,250,000
Market Value of Preferred Shares = 5,000 * $100 = $500,000
Total Market Value of Shares = $1,250,000 + $500,000 = $1,750,000
Using the figures obtained above:
Market Value Added = $1,750,000 – 750,000 = $1,000,000

 FINANCIAL DISTRESS AND INSOLVENCY
Generally the affairs of a firm should be managed in such a way that the total risk – business as well as financial
– borne by equity holders is minimised and is manageable, otherwise, the firm would obviously face difficulties.
In managing business risk, the firm has to cope with the variability of the demand for its products, their prices,
input prices, etc. It has also to keep a tab on fixed costs. As regards financial risk, high proportion of debt in
the capital structure entails a high level of interest payments. If cash inflow is inadequate, the firm will face
difficulties in payment of interest and repayment of principal. If the situation continues long enough, a time will
come when the firm would face pressure from creditors. Failure of sales can also cause difficulties in carrying
out production operations. The firm would find itself in a tight spot. Investors would not invest further. Creditors
would recall their loans. Capital market would heavily discount its securities. Thus, the firm would find itself in
a situation called distress. It may have to sell its assets to discharge its obligations to outsiders at prices below
their economic values i.e. resort to distress sale. So when the sale proceeds is inadequate to meet outside
liabilities, the firm is said to have failed or become bankrupt or (after due processes of law are gone through)
insolvent.
Failure of a firm is technical if it is unable to meet its current obligations. The failure could be temporary and might
be remediable. When liabilities exceed assets i.e. the net worth becomes negative, bankruptcy, as commonly
understood, arises. Technical bankruptcy can be ascertained by comparing current assets and current liabilities
i.e. working out current ratio or quick ratio. On the other hand, solvency ratios indicate long term liquidity i.e. the
ability of the firm to discharge its term-liabilities. Examples of solvency ratios are Debt to Equity ratio, Debt to
total Funds Ratios, and Interest coverage ratio. Trend analysis should be made for the past three to five years
to pick up signals of bankruptcy, if any.

 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IS A SCIENCE OR AN ART
Financial Management is a subject within the compass of social science as it deals with people. Its nature
is nearer to applied sciences as it envisages use of classified and tested knowledge as a help in practical
affairs and solving business.
Theory of financial management is based on certain systematic principles, some of which can be tested in
mathematical equations like the law of physics and chemistry. Financial management contains a much larger
body of rules or tendencies that hold true in general and on the average. The use of computers, operations
research, statistical techniques and econometric models find wide application in financial management as tools
for solving corporate financial problems like budgeting, choice of investments, acquisition or mergers etc. This
takes the financial management nearer to treatment as a subject of science. Nevertheless, there remains a
wide scope for application of value judgement in financial decision making. Most practical problems of finance
have no hard and fast answers that can be worked out mathematically or programmed on a computer. They
must be solved by value judgement, intuition and the “feel” of experience. Thus, despite its frequent acceptance
as an applied science, finance remains largely an art. Because, according to George A. Christy and Peyton
Foster Roden (Finance: Environment and Decisions) knowledge of facts, principles and concepts is necessary
for making decisions but personal involvement of the manager through his intuitive capacities and power of
judgement becomes essential. This makes financial management and managing a company’s finance both an

                                                                                                                   455
EP-CA&FM                                                                           Introduction (Financial Management)

art and a science. It requires a feel for the situation and analytical skills alongwith a thorough knowledge of the
techniques and tools of financial analysis and the know-how to apply them and interpret the results.
A very interesting presentation has been made by Weston in his book “Methodology in Finance”. The finance
functions are mainly three viz., planning, organisation and financial control. In each of these finance functions
elements of science and art can be observed. Wherever methodology is to be applied in decision making in all
these areas, the subject matter becomes a science confronted with the framework of techniques and tools. On
the other hand, when the question of choice to make selection out of the alternative results arises the subject
matter becomes an art requiring human skills for value judgement. For example, in planning function, there
are certain goals, which may be short-term goals or long-term goals. Each falls within the area of art. Another
parameter of planning is estimating funds, which may again be short-term or long-term involving techniques
and skills. When involvement to techniques is there the subject matter remains science and when the skills
are required to be interpreted, the subject matter becomes an art. It so happens in all aspects of planning,
organisation and control.
Thus, in the entire study of financial management whether it is related to investment decision, financing decisions
i.e. deciding about the sources of financing, or dividend decision, there is a mixture of science as well as art.
When techniques for analytical purposes are used it is science and when choice in appreciation of the results is
made it is an art. Thus, people will like to call financial management as science as well as art. But it is better if
we say that the discipline of financial management has both the aspects of science as well as art; where there
is theory of systematic knowledge it is science and where there is application it is art.

 EMERGING ROLES OF FINANCIAL MANAGER
With the evolution of finance from being mere a descriptive study to the one that is highly developed discipline,
the role of financial managers has also undergone a sea change. His areas of responsibilities now extend
far beyond keeping records, reports, the firm’s cash position, paying bills and obtaining funds, and he is now
concerned with and is fully involved in the decision making processes to decide investment of funds in assets,
determining the best mix of financing and dividends in relation to overall valuation of the firm. The responsibilities
of the financial manager are linked to the goal of ensuring liquidity, profitability or both and is also related to
the management of assets and funds of any business enterprise. When the Financial Manager is involved in
management of asset, he is performing the role of the decision-maker and when he is managing funds, he is
performing the staff function. In the light of different responsibilities of the financial manager, he performs mainly
the following duties:
      1.   Forecasting of Cash Flow: This is necessary for the successful day to day operations of the business so
           that it can discharge its obligations as and when they arise. In fact, it involves matching of cash inflows
           against outflows and the manager must forecast the sources and timing of inflows from customers and
           use them to pay the liability.
   2.      Raising Funds: The Financial Manager has to plan for mobilising funds from different sources so that
           the requisite amount of funds are made available to the business enterprise to meet its requirements
           for short term, medium term and long term.
   3.      Managing the Flow of Internal Funds: Here the Manager has to keep a track of the surplus in various
           bank accounts of the organisation and ensure that they are properly utilised to meet the requirements
           of the business. This will ensure that liquidity position of the company is maintained intact with the
           minimum amount of external borrowings.
   4.      To Facilitate Cost Control: The Financial Manager is generally the first person to recognise when the
           costs for the supplies or production processes are exceeding the standard costs/budgeted figures.
           Consequently, he can make recommendations to the top management for controlling the costs.

   5.    To Facilitate Pricing of Product, Product Lines and Services: The Financial Manager can supply
         important information about cost changes and cost at varying levels of production and the profit
         margins needed to carry on the business successfully. In fact, financial manager provides tools of
         analysis of information in pricing decisions and contribute to the formulation of pricing policies jointly
         with the marketing manager.
   6.    Forecasting Profits: The Financial manager is usually responsible for collecting the relevant data to
         make forecasts of profit levels in future.
    7.   Measuring Required Return: The acceptance or rejection of an investment proposal depends on
         whether the expected return from the proposed investment is equal to or more than the required rate of
         return. An investment project is accepted if the expected return is equal or more than the required rate
         of return. Determination of required rate of return is the responsibility of the financial manager and is a
         part of the financing decision.
   8.    Managing Assets: The function of asset management focuses on the decision-making role of the
         financial manager. Finance personnel meet with other officers of the firm and participate in making
         decisions affecting the current and future utilisation of the firm’s resources. As an example, managers
         may discuss the total amount of assets needed by the firm to carry out its operations. They will determine
         the composition or a mix of assets that will help the firm best achieve its goals. They will identify ways
         to use existing assets more effectively and reduce waste and unwarranted expenses.
		 The decision-making role crosses liquidity and profitability lines. Converting the idle equipment into
   cash improves liquidity. Reducing costs improves profitability.
   9.    Managing Funds: Funds may be viewed as the liquid assets of the firm. In the management of funds,
         the financial manager acts as a specialised staff officer to the Chief Executive of the company. The
         manager is responsible for having sufficient funds for the firm to conduct its business and to pay its
         bills. Money must be located to finance receivables and inventories, to make arrangements for the
         purchase of assets, and to identify the sources of long- term financing. Cash must be available to pay
         dividends declared by the board of directors. The management of funds has therefore, both liquidity and
         profitability aspects. If the firm’s funds are inadequate, the firm may default on the payment of liabilities
         and may have to pay higher interest. If the firm does not carefully choose its financing methods, it may
         pay excessive interest costs with a subsequent decline in profits.

 RELATION OF FINANCE TO ECONOMICS AND ACCOUNTING
Financial management has a close relationship to economics on the one hand and accounting on the other.
Relationship to Economics: There are two significant linkages between economics and finance. The macro-
economic environment defines the setting within which a firm operates and the micro-economic theory provides
the conceptual underpinning for the tools of financial decision making.
Key macro-economic factors such as the growth rate of the economy, the domestic savings rate, the role of
the government in the economic affairs, the tax structure, the nature of external economic relationships, the
availability of funds to the corporate sector, the rate of inflation, the real rate of interest, and the terms on which
the firm can raise finances define the environment in which the firm operates. No financial manager can afford
to ignore the important developments in the macro-economic sphere and the impact of the same on the firm.
While an understanding of the macro-economic developments sensitises the financial manager to the
opportunities and threats in the environment, a firm grounding in micro-economic principles sharpens his
analysis of decision alternatives. Finance, in essence, is applied micro-economics. For instance, the principle
of marginal analysis- a key principle of micro-economics according to which a decision should be guided by
comparison of incremental benefits and costs is applicable to a number of managerial decisions in finance.

                                                                                                                  457
EP-CA&FM                                                                       Introduction (Financial Management)

Thus in a nutshell, a basic knowledge of macro-economics is essential for comprehending the environment in
which the firm operates and a good grasp of micro-economic principles is helpful in sharpening the tools of
financial decision making.
Relationship to Accounting: The finance and accounting functions are closely related and almost invariably
fall within the realm of the chief financial officer as shown in the exhibit below-
                                       Organisation of Finance Function




                                                                                                    Manager


Given this affinity, it is not surprising that in popular perception finance and accounting are often considered
indistinguishable or at least substantially overlapping. However, as a student of finance one must know how the
two differ and how the two relate. The following discussion highlights the differences and relationship between
the two.
Score Keeping vs. Value Maximising- Accounting is concerned with score keeping, whereas finance is aimed
at value maximizing. The primary objective of accounting is to gauge the performance of the firm, assess its
financial condition, and ascertain the base for tax payment. The principal goal of financial management is to
create shareholder value by investing in positive net present value projects and minimising the cost of financing.
Of course, financial decision making requires substantial inputs from accounting. As Gitman says:
“The accountant’s role is to provide consistently developed and easily interpreted data about the firm’s past,
present, and future operations. The financial manager uses these data, either in raw form or after certain
adjustments and analyses , as an important input to the decision making process.”
Accrual Method vs. Cash Flow Method- The accountant prepares the accounting reports based on the
accrual method which recognises revenues when the sale occurs (irrespective of whether the case is realised
immediately or not) and matches expenses to sales (irrespective of whether cash is paid or not). The focus of
the financial manager, however, is on cash flows. He is concerned about the magnitude, timing, and risk of cash
flows as these are the fundamental determinants of values.
Certainty vs. Uncertainty: Accounting deals primarily with the past. It records what has happened. Hence, it is
relatively more objective and certain. Finance is concerned mainly with the future. It involves decision making
under the imperfect information and uncertainty. Hence, it is characterised by a high degree of subjectivity.

                                              LESSON ROUND-UP

   l Financial Management deals with procurement of funds and their effective utilizations in the business
       and concerned with investment, financing and dividend decisions in relation to objectives of the
       company.
   l Investment decisions are essentially made after evaluating the different project proposals with
       reference to growth and profitability projections of the company.
   l Financing decisions are concerned with the determination of how much funds to procure from amongst
       the various avenues available i.e. the financing mix or capital structure.
   l Dividend decision is to decide whether the firm should distribute all profits or retain them or distribute
       a portion and retain the balance.
   l Profit maximization ensures that firm utilizes its available resources most efficiently under conditions of
       competitive markets.
   l Wealth maximization means the management of an organization maximizes the present value not only
       for shareholders but for all including employees, customers, suppliers and community at large.
   l Economic value added is the after cash flow generated by a business minus the cost of capital it has
       deployed to generate that cash flow.
   l Liquidity means ability of the business to meet short-term obligations. It shows the quickness with
       which a business/company can convert its assets into cash to pay what it owes in the near future.
   l Profitability ratio reflects on the ability of management to earn a return on resources put in by the
       shareholders evaluating the performance of the company in different spheres
   l Affairs of the firm should be managed in such a way that the total risk – business as well as financial
       borne by equity shareholders is minimised and is manageable.



                                                   GLOSSARY

 Risk Premium: A risk premium is the investment return an asset is expected to yield in excess of the risk-
 free rate of return. An asset’s risk premium is a form of compensation for investors. It represents payment to
 investors for tolerating the extra risk in a given investment over that of a risk-free asset.
 Net worth: Net worth is an easy one to start with. You may have heard the term in your day-to-day, from
 financial experts discussing a company’s net worth, to magazines discussing a certain celebrity’s value in
 dollars. In a business context, net worth simply means the difference between your total assets and total
 amount you owe to your creditors and other financial stakeholders.
 A positive net worth indicates good financial health, whilst a negative net worth means your company is
 operating at a loss.
 Inflation: Without getting too much into the nitty gritty of corporate finance, inflation means the sustained
 increase in the price of goods and services over a certain period, in relation to the value of your national
 currency. One inflation indicator working professionals should look out for is if their income is rising
 proportionately with the national rate of inflation. Furthermore, if your organisation operates on a global
 scale, inflation can have an impact on your price point when selling outside your country’s borders.

 Diversification: Diversification is a risk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments
 within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an
 attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio
 constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of
 any individual holding or security.
 Enterprise Value (EV): A measure of a company’s value, calculated by: market capitalisation plus debt &
 preferred shares minus cash and cash equivalents. It is the theoretical takeover price that a buyer would
 pay for a company less the cash.
 Non-Financial Goals
 The non-financial goals include:
      i) Environmental care;
  ii) Enhancing ethics in business and finance;
  iii) Employee welfare;
  iv) Corporate social responsibility;
  v) Good creditor relations;
  vi) Compliance with government regulations;
 vii) Addressing customers’ interests.

 Introduction
Money has time value. A rupee today is more valuable than a rupee a year hence. The key reasons or it are
as under:
      i)    Individuals, in general, prefer current consumption to future consumption.
      ii)   Capital can be employed productively to generate positive returns. An investment of one rupee today
            would grow to (1+r) a year hence (r is the rate of return earned on the investment).
   iii)     In an inflationary period a rupee today represents a greater rea purchasing power than a rupee a year
            hence.
Most financial problems involve cash flows occurring at different points of time. These cash flows have to be
brought to the same point of time for purposes of comparison and aggregation. Hence one should understand
the tools of compounding and discounting which underlie most of what we do in finance- from valuing securities
to analysing projects, from determining lease rentals to choosing the right financing instruments, from setting
up the loan amortisation schedules to valuing companies, so on and so forth.
Time Value of Money (TVM) is a fundamental financial concept, stating that the current value of money is higher
than its future value, given its potential to earn in the years to come. Thus, it suggests that a sum of money in
hand is greater in value than the same sum of money received in the next couple of years.
‘Time value of money’ is central to the concept of finance. It recognizes that the value of money is different at
different points of time. Since money can be put to productive use, its value is different depending upon when
it is received or paid.
Key takeaways-
      1.    The time value of money means that a sum of money is worth more now than the same sum of money
            in the future.
    2.      The principle of the time value of money means that it can grow only through investing so a delayed
            investment is a lost opportunity.
    3.      The formula for computing the time value of money considers the amount of money, its future value, the
            amount it can earn, and the time frame.
    4.      For savings accounts, the number of compounding periods is an important determinant as well.
    5.      Inflation has a negative impact on the time value of money because your purchasing power decreases
            as prices rise.

 CONCEPTS OF TIME VALUE OF MONEY

 Compound and Simple Interest
So far we have observed the cases where money is invested at compound interest which means that each
interest payment is reinvested to earn further interest in future periods. By contrast, if no interest is earned on
interest the investment earns only simple interest. In such a case the investment grows as follows:
Future value = Present Value [1+Number of years x Interest rate].
For example, an investment of Rs.1,000, if invested at 12 percent simple interest rate will in 5 years time become:
1,000 [1 + 5 x 0.12] = Rs.1,600.
The following exhibit 1 shows how an investment of Rs.1,000 grows over time under simple interest as well as

Thus, from the above exhibit it can be observed that how money grows under simple interest and compound
interest. Note that under simple interest the growth is linear and under compound interest the growth is
exponential.
In the ensuing paragraphs now we will focus on the crucial concepts of time value of money, i.e., Present value
of a single amount, Future value of a single amount.

1. Present Value of a Single Amount
Many times in business and life, we want to determine the value today of receiving a specific single amount at
some time in the future. For example, suppose you want to know the value today of receiving $15,000 at the
end of 5 years if a rate of return of 12% is earned.
Another way of asking this question is: What amount would you need to invest today at 12% compounded
annually in order to receive $15,000 after 5 years?
Problems and questions like this are known as “present value of a single amount problems.” This is because we
are interested in finding the present value, or the value today, of receiving a set sum in the future. Intuitively, we
know that the present value will be less than the future value. For example, if you had the choice of receiving
$12,000 today or in 2 years, you would take the $12,000 today.
This is because you can invest the $12,000 so that it will accumulate to more than $12,000 at the end of 2 years.
Another way of looking at this is to say that because of the time value of money, you would take an amount
less than $12,000 if you could receive it today, instead of $12,000 in 2years. The amount you would be willing
to accept depends on the interest rate or the rate of return you receive.
The formula used to calculate the present value of a single amount is:
PV = FV/(1 + i) n where PV = present value, FV = future value, i = decimalized interest rate, and n = number
of periods.

                                                                                                                   465
EP-CA&FM                                                                                       Time Value of Money


 Illustration 1:
 Suppose a company expects to receive $8,000 after 5 years. Calculate the present value of this sum if the
 current market interest rate is 12% and the interest is compounded annually.
 Solution:
 The way to solve this is to apply the above present value formula. In this example, the number of periods (n)
 is 5 and the interest rate (i) is 12%. Therefore, the present value (PV) is calculated as follows:
 PV = FV x 1 / (1+i)n
 = 8,000 x 1 / (1+12%)5
 = 8,000 x 1 / (1+0.12)5
 = 8,000 x 1 / (1.12)5
 = 8,000 x 1 / 1.7623
 = 8,000 x 0.5674
 PV = $4,540

 Illustration 2: What is the present value of $1,000 received in two years if the interest rate is?
 (a) 12% per year discounted annually.
 (b) 12% per year discounted semi-annually.
 (c) 12% per year discounted daily
 Solution:
      (a)   12% per year discounted annually.
 		 =1,000 / (1 + 0.12) 2
 		 = $797.19
      (b)   12% per year discounted semi-annually.
 		 = 1,000 / (1 + 0.12/2) 2*2
 		 = $792.09
      (c)   12% per year discounted daily
 		 = 1,000 / (1 + 0.12/365) 2*365
 		 = $786.66

 Illustration 3: $7,000 for 10 years from now at 7% is worth how much today?
 Solution:
 7,000 / (1 + 0.07) 10
 = $3,558.45

 Present Value of an Uneven Series
In financial analysis we often witness uneven cash flow streams. For instance, the cash flow stream associated
with a capital investment project is typically uneven. Likewise, the dividend stream associated with an equity
share is usually uneven and perhaps growing.
The present value of a cash flow stream- uneven or even may be calculated with the help of the following
formula:
Following is the formula to calculate the PV of uneven cash flows:

                                CF0            CF1              CF2                          CFN

                     PV   =     —–        +    —–          +    —–        +   —–    +        —–

                               (1 + r)0       (1 + r)1         (1 + r)2                     (1 + r)N

In simple words, we can put the above formula as:
PV = Sum of CFn/(1 + r)^n
In the above formula,
In is the number of years, CFn is the cash flow for the year, and n and r is the discount rate for the year. The
discount rate is generally the opportunity rate or interest that an asset could generate elsewhere.
The following table explains the present value of an uneven cash flow stream

 Present Value of an Annuity
The present value of an annuity is the current value of future payments from an annuity, given a specified rate
of return, or discount rate. The higher the discount rate, the lower the present value of the annuity.
Key points-
   l    The present value of an annuity refers to how much money would be needed today to fund a series of
        future annuity payments.
   l    Because of the time value of money, a sum of money received today is worth more than the same sum
        at a future date.
   l    One can use a present value calculation to determine whether he will receive more money by taking a
        lump sum now or an annuity spread out over a number of years.
The formula to compute Present Value of an Annuity is as under:

               1 – ( 1 / (1 +r)n)
P = PMT x
                       r


                                                                                                           469
EP-CA&FM                                                                                  Time Value of Money

where:
P= Present value of an annuity stream.
PMT = Monetary value of each annuity payment.
r = Interest rate (also known as discount rate).
n = Number of periods in which payments will be made.

 Illustration 13:
 Assume a person has the opportunity to receive an ordinary annuity that pays $50,000 per year for the next
 25 years, with a 6% discount rate, or take a $650,000 lump-sum payment. Which is the better option? Using
 the above formula, the present value of the annuity is:

                                     1 – (1 / (1+0.06)25)
  Present Value = $50,000 x
                                            0.06
 = $639,168

 Applications of Present Value of an Annuity
The present value annuity formula can be applied in a variety of contexts. Its important applications are as
under:
   a)    How much can you borrow for a car: After reviewing your budget, you have ascertained that you can
         afford to pay Rs.12,000 per month for 3 years toward a new car. You call a finance company and learn
         that the current rate of interest on car finance is 1.5 percent per month for 36 months. How much you
         borrow?
		 To determine how much you can borrow, we have to calculate the present value of Rs.12,000 per month
   for 36 months at 1.5 percent per month.
		 Since the loan payments are an ordinary annuity, the present value interest factor annuity is –

                             1
                      1
                          (1 +r )n
         PVIFAr,n=
                             r

                               1
                     1–
                          (1 .015 )36 =27.70
                =
                            0.15
		 Hence the present value of 36 payments of Rs.12,000 each is:
		 Present value = Rs.12,000 x 27.70 = Rs.332,400
		 You can, therefore, borrow Rs.332,400 to buy the car.
   b)    Period of Loan Amortisation: You want to borrow Rs.1,080,000 to buy a flat. You approach a housing
         finance company which charges 12.5 percent interest. You can pay Rs.180,000 per year toward loan
         amortisation. What should be the maturity period of the loan?
		 The present value of annuity of Rs.180,000 is set equal to Rs. 1,080,000.

		 You can perhaps request for a maturity of 12 years.
   c)   Determining the Loan Amortisation Schedule: Most loans are repaid in equal periodic instalments
        (monthly, quarterly, or annually), which cover interest and principal repayment. Such loans are referred
        to as amortised loans.
		 For an amortised loan we would like to know i) the periodic instalment payment and ii) the loan
   amortisation schedule showing the break up of the periodic instalments payments between the interest
   component and the principal repayment component. To illustrate how these are calculated, let us look
   at an example.
		 Suppose a firm borrows Rs.1,000,000 at an interest rate of 15 percent and the loan is to be repaid in 5
   equal instalments payable at the end of each of the next 5 years. The annual instalment payment A is
   obtained by solving the following equation.
		 Loan amount = A x PVIFA n= 5, r = 15%
		 1,000,000 = A x 3.3522
		 Hence A = 298,312

   d)      Determining the Periodic Withdrawal: Suppose your father deposits Rs.300,000 on retirement in a bank
           which pays 10 percent annual interest. How much can be withdrawn annually for a period of 10 years?

                                       1
           A = Rs.300,000 x
                                PVIFA10%, 10

                                 1
           = Rs.300,000 x
                               6.145
		 = Rs.48,819.
   e)      Finding the Interest Rate: let us assume that someone offers you the following financial contract: If you
           deposit Rs.10,000 with him he promises to pay Rs.2,500 annually for 6 years. What interest rate do you
           earn on this deposit? The interest rate may be calculated in two steps:
		 Step 1: Find the PVIFAr,6 for this contract by dividing Rs.10,000 by Rs.2,500

                          Rs.10,000
           PVIFAr,6 =                  = 4%
                          Rs.2,500
		 Step 2: Look at the PVIFA table and read the row corresponding to 6 years until you find a value close
   to 4.000. Doing so, you find that
		PVIFA 12%, 6 is 4.111 and PVIFA14%,6 is 3.889
		 Since 4.000 lies in the middle of these values the interest rate lies (approximately) in the middle. So, the
   interest rate is 13 percent.
      f)   Valuing an Infrequent Annuity: Rajan will receive an annuity of Rs.50,000, payable once every two
           years. The payments will stretch out over 30 years. The first payment will be received at the end of two
           years. If the annual interest rate is 8 percent, what is the present value of the annuity?
		 The interest rate over a two-year period is, (1.08) x (1.08) – 1 =16.64 percent.
		 This means that Rs.100 invested over two years will yield Rs.116.64.
		 Here, present value of Rs.50,000 annuity over 15 periods needs to be calculated, with an interest rate
   of 16.64 percent per period. This works out to:
		 Rs.50,000 [{ 1 – (1/1.1664)15 }] / 0.1664 = Rs.270,620
   g)      Equating Present Value of Two Annuities: Raj wants to save for the college education of his son, Deepak.

        Ravi estimates that the college education expenses will be rupees one million per year for four years
        when his son reaches college in 16 years – the expenses will be payable at the beginning of the years.
        He expects the annual interest rate of 8 percent over the next two decades. How much money should
        he deposit
  Illustration 14:
  Issac has just won the lottery and decides to take the 20 year annuity option. The lottery commission
  invests his winnings in an account that pays 4.8% interest, compounded annually. Each year for those 20
  years, Tom receives a check from the lottery commission for $250,000. What is the present value of Tom’s
  winnings? (Notice that this would be the amount that Tom would get if he chose the lump-sum option).
  What is the total amount of money that Tom gets over the 20 year period?
  Solution:
  This is clearly an annuity question since it says so in the problem. We are told what the payments are for
  the annuity, and asked to find the present value, so we use the present value formula for an annuity:
                  1 – (1 + i)-n
   PV = PMT x
                           i
  Since this annuity is compounded annually (and the payments are made annually), (meaning and ), and
  we get
                       1 – (1 + 0.048)-20
   PV = 250000 x
                               0.048
  = $3169070.90

  Illustration 15: John has just received an inheritance of $400,000 and would like to be able to make
  monthly withdrawals over the next 15 years. She decides on an annuity that pays 6.7%, compounded
  monthly. How much will her monthly payments be in order to draw the account down to zero at the end
  of 15 years?
  Solution:
  Since John will be making periodic withdrawals from an account, this is an annuity question. She would
  like to know how much each withdrawal will be so that the entire inheritance will be gone after 15 years.
  We use the payment formula for an annuity to find out how much each withdrawal (payment) will be:

                       i
  PMT = PV x
                 1 – (1 + i)-n

                 0.067 / 12
   = 400,000 x                       = $3528.56
                 1 – (1 + i)-12*15
  Thus, each withdrawal will be $3,528.56. At the end of the 15 years, nothing will be left.


  Illustration 16:
  Amar is working in a tire factory that offers a pension in the form of an annuity that pays 5% annual
  interest, compounded monthly. He wants to work for 30 years and then have a retirement income of
  $4000 per month for 25 years. How much do he and his employer together have to deposit per month into
  the pension fund to accomplish this?


                                                                                                          473
EP-CA&FM                                                                                        Time Value of Money


  Solution:
  This problem is probably the most realistic, and most closely matches what a typical person will do in his
  or her life (save money during their working life, then spend that money during retirement). The only thing
  we know is what Amar wants to have during retirement: $4,000 per month for 25 years.
  Since this is money he will be withdrawing from an account, it is an annuity. We would first like to know
  how much money he needs in order to be able to make these monthly withdrawals for 25 years. Thus, we
  need the present value of an annuity:

                    1 – (1 + i)-n
      PV = PMT x
                          i

                 1 – (1 + 0.05/ 12)-12*25
      = 4000 x
                       0.05 / 12
  = $684,240.19
  Thus, Amar will need $684,240.19 to fund his retirement annuity.


  Illustration 16 (A):
  Rebecea has set up a savings account with her bank and will be paying $350 a month into the account
  for the next five years. The annual interest rate is 3% and the annual growth rate is 2%. How can Rebecca
  work out the present value of these payments?
  Solution: Since the interest in this example is applied annually, the number of periods (n) will be 5, and the
  total annual payment is $350 x 12 = $4,200.
  If the interest rate was applied monthly, we would take the annual interest rates and divide them by 12 to
  get a monthly discount rate (i) of 0.0025% and a monthly growth rate (g) of 0.0017%, using a total number
  of periods (n) of 60.

                              (1 – (1 + 2%)5 x (1+3%)-5
   PV = $4,200 X                                          = $19,996.28
                                     2% - 3%

  Now, what if Rebecea’s bank did pay the interest monthly instead of annually? In that case, the formula
  would look like this:

                        (1 – (1 + 0.0017%)60 x (1 + 0.0025%) -60 )
      PV = $350 x                                                    = $20,994.52
                                    0.0017% - 0.0025%

  It can be seen that the PV of the annuity is growing faster because the payments are compounding 12 times a year
  at the 2% growth rate instead of just once a year with annual interest.

   $1000 at the beginning of each quarter until he is 70 in an account that pays 8.5% and is compounded
   quarterly. Will he have enough to make it happen and by how much amount he is having surplus or deficit?
   Solution: Find the amount Mr.Z need to support those requirements from age 70 to 95.

                      1 – (1 + 0.045 /12)-12 (25)
    PV = 3200
                             0.045 /12

   PV = $575713.03 is needed by Mr. Z to support himself from 70-95 years old.


 Present Value of Perpetuity
Perpetuity can be defined as the income stream that the individual gets for an infinite time period and its present
value is arrived at by discounting the identical cash flows with the discounting rate. Here the cash flows are
infinite but its present value amounts to a limited value.
Perpetuity is a series of cash flows that have an infinite life, and such an income stream grows with a proportionate
rate. The cash flows should be identical.
The formula is basically derived from the dividend growth model. The formula attempts to determine the
terminal value of the identical cash flows. Therefore, the present value of the cash flows at basic expression
can be derived as follows: –
Present value = D / (1+r) + D x (1 + g) / (1 + r) ^2 + D / (1+r) + D x (1 + g) ^2 / (1 + r) ^3……….
PV of Perpetuity = ICF / r
Here,
    l    The identical cash flows are regarded as the CF.
    l    The interest rate or the discounting rate is expressed as r.
If the perpetuity grows by a constant growth rate, then it would be expressed as described below: –
PV of Perpetuity = ICF / (r – g)
Here,
The identical cash flows are regarded as the CF.
The interest rate or the discounting rate is expressed as r.
The growth rate is expressed as g.
Uses of Present Value of Perpetuity
    l    Perpetuity is normally utilized in preferred stocks.
    l    The preferred stocks tend to provide fixed dividends throughout the company life cycle.
    l    Since the perpetuity is an infinite amount, its present value helps in arriving at a value that has a limited
         amount.
    l    The perpetuity has its applications in real estate as well.
    l    If the real estate provides a sustainable income stream, then its present value is derived using the
         relationship of the present value of a perpetuity.


                                                                                                                 475
EP-CA&FM                                                                                        Time Value of Money

      l   Additionally, the PV of the perpetuity forms the basis for several endowment schemes and retirement
          planning.
      l   Endowment schemes are financial protection plans that provide financial protections as well as cater
          to a comprehensive saving plan.
      l   Such schemes, if planned properly, can deliver a fixed income stream for infinite tenure.


  Illustration 17:
  Magnificent Limited pays $2 in dividends annually and estimates that they will pay the dividends
  indefinitely. How much are investors willing to pay for the dividend with a required rate of return of 5%?
  Solution: PV = 2/5% = $40
  An investor will consider investing in the company if the stock price is $40 or less.

 Future Value of a Single Amount
The value of a current single amount taken to a future date at a specified interest rate is called the future value
of a single amount.
In this case, “future value” means the amount to which the investment will grow at a future date if interest is
compounded. The single amount refers to a lump sum invested at the beginning of a period (e.g., year 1) and
left intact for all periods.
Formula and Calculation of Future Value-
FV=I×(1+(R×T))
where:
I=Investment amount
R=Interest rate
T=Number of years
To explain the concept of the future value of a single amount, let’s start with the table below.

           Year                 Principal amount at       Annual interest income          Accumulated at end
                           beginning of the year ($)                    @12% ($)               of the year ($)

             1                             10,000.00                      1,200.00                    11,200.00

             2                              11,200.00                     1,344.00                  12,544.00

             3                             12,544.00                      1,505.00                  14,049.28

In the above table, we see what the future amount of $10,000 invested at 12% annual interest for three years
would be given a certain compounding pattern. This is an example of determining the future value of a single
amount.
There were no additional investments or interest withdrawals. These future value or compound interest
calculations are important in many personal and business financial decisions.
Future value (FV) is the value of a current asset at a future date based on an assumed rate of growth. The future

value is important to investors and financial planners, as they use it to estimate how much an investment made
today will be worth in the future.
Knowing the future value enables investors to make sound investment decisions based on their anticipated
needs. However, external economic factors, such as inflation, can adversely affect the future value of the asset
by eroding its value.

  Solution: The monthly interest rate is .084/12 = .007. Using it as the growth rate, the future value of money
  after twelve months is:
  FV = 12000(1.007)12 = $13,047.73
  The interest earned = 13,047.73 – 12,000 = $1047.73. You have to pay 15% tax on this amount. Thus after
  paying taxes, it becomes =1047.73(1 – .15) = $890.57.
  Total amount available after 12 months = 12,000 + 890.57 = $12,890.57.

  annual compounding, find the implied rate of interest for this loan.
  Solution: The future value of the loaned money is FV = $1000, while its present value is PV = $850. The
  time for compounding is n = 3 years. The interest rate r is unknown.
  Using FV = PV (1 + r) n
  We get 1000 = 850(1 + r) 3
  or, (1000/850)1/3 = 1 + r
  or, 1 + r = 1.0556672
  which gives r = 0.0557 = 5.57%

  Illustration 27:
  You have borrowed $10,000 from a bank with the understanding that you will pay it off with a lump sum of
  $12,000 after 2 years. Find the annual rate of interest on this loan.
  Solution: Here the future value is $12,000, present value $10,000, and n = 2. Use
  FV = PV (1 + r) n
  This gives 12,000 = 10,000 (1 + r) 2
  Or, r = 12‚000 10‚000 − 1 = .09545 = 9.545%

  Illustration 28:
  Global Banking Corporation offers two types of certificates of deposit, each requiring a deposit of $10,000.
  The first one pays $11,271.60 after 24 months, and the second one pays $12,139.47 after 36 months. Find
  their monthly-compounded rate of return.
  Solution: Using FV = PV (1 + r) n
  We get for the first CD,
  11,271.60 = 10,000(1 + R1) 24
  Solving for R1, we get
                        1/24
        11,271.60 
  R1 =                        - 1 = 0.005
        10,000 

  Similarly working on the second CD, we get

                                                                                                             479

                        1/24
         11,271.60 
   R2 = 
         10,000 

  The first certificate gives a return of .5%, and the second one .54% per month. The second one is higher
  because the investor has to tie up the money for a longer period

  Illustration 29:
  A bank account pays 5.5% annual interest, compounded monthly. How long will it take the money to
  double in this account?
  Solution: If the present value is $1, its future value is $2. The bank is compounding monthly, thus the
  interest rate is 5.5/12 percent per month.
  FV = PV (1 + r) n
  we get 2 = 1(1 + .055/12)n
  Taking logarithms of both sides, ln 2 = n ln(1.0045833),
  or, n = ln(2) / ln(1.0045833)
  = 151.58 months = approximately, 12 years and 8 months

 Future Value of an Annuity
The future value of an annuity is the value of a group of recurring payments at a certain date in the future,
assuming a particular rate of return, or discount rate. The higher the discount rate, the greater the annuity’s
future value.
Key Features:
      l   The future value of an annuity is a way of calculating how much money a series of payments will be
          worth at a certain point in the future.
      l   By contrast, the present value of an annuity measures how much money will be required to produce a
          series of future payments.
      l   In an ordinary annuity, payments are made at the end of each agreed-upon period. In an annuity due,
          payments are made at the beginning of each period.
The formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity is as follows. (An ordinary annuity pays interest at the
end of a particular period, rather than at the beginning, as is the case with an annuity due.)

            (1 +r)n
P = PMT x
              r
where:
P = Future value of an annuity stream
PMT = Dollar amount of each annuity payment
r = Interest rate (also known as discount rate)
n = Number of periods in which payments will be made

  Illustration 30:
  Assume someone decides to invest $125,000 per year for the next five years in an annuity they expect to
  compound at 8% per year. What will be the expected future value of this payment stream?

                                                     ((1 + 0.08)5 - 1)
  Solution: Future Value = $125,000 x                                    = $733,325
                                                          0.08
  With an annuity due, where payments are made at the beginning of each period, the formula is slightly
  different. To find the future value of an annuity due, simply multiply the formula above by a factor of (1 +
  r). So:

                   ((1 +r)n – 1)
  P = PMT x                        x (1 +r)
                          r
  If the same example as above were an annuity due, its future value would be calculated as follows:

                                        ((1 + 0.08)5 – 1)
  Future Value = $125,000 x                                    x (1 + 0.08)
                                              0.08
   = $791,991.

  Illustration 31:
  John deposits money into his savings account at the beginning of each year, depending on the returns of
  the business. He deposits $1000 in the first year, $2000 in the second year, $5000 in the third, and $7000
  in the fourth year. The account credits interest at an annual interest rate of 7%. What is the closest value
  of the accumulated money in the savings account at the beginning of year 4?
  Solution: The future value of the unequal payments is the sum of individual accumulations:
  = 1000(1.07)3 + 2000(1.07)2 + 5000(1.07)1 + 7000(1.07)0 = $16,975.38

  Illustration 32:
  Suppose Arjun invest $2000 per year in a stock index fund, which earns 9% per year, for the next ten
  years, what would be the closest value of the accumulated value of the investment upon payment of the
  last instalment?
  Solution: From the information given in the question:
  A=2000
  N=10
  r=9%
  So that:

                 (1 +r)N - 1
   FVN = A
                     r

                 (1 +r)10 -1
   = 2000
                   0.09
  = $ 30,385.8594

  Illustration 33:
  An individual makes rental payments of $1,200 per month and wants to know the present value of their
  annual rentals over a 12-month period. The payments are made at the start of each month. The current
  interest rate is 8% per annum.
  Solution: PV
  = $1,200 x 1- (1 + (0.08 /12)) -12 x (1 + (0.08/12))
  		 ------------------
  		 (0.08/12)
  FV of investment = $1200 x 11.57
  FV of investment = $13,886.90

  Illustration 34:
  A company wants to invest $3,500 every six months for four years to purchase a delivery truck. The
  investment will be compounded at an annual interest rate of 12% per annum. The initial investment will be
  made now, and thereafter, at the beginning of every six months. What is the future value of the cash flow
  payments?
  Solution:

                              $3500 x (1 + (0.12 /2)) 2x4 -1
  FV of the investment =                                       x (1 + (0.12 / 2))
                                         (0.12/2)
  FV of the Investment = $3,500 x 10.49
  FV of the Investment = $36,719.61

 Annuity Due vs. Ordinary Annuity
1. Payments: The major difference between annuity due and the more popular ordinary annuity is that payments
for an ordinary annuity are made at the end of the period, as opposed to annuity due payments made at the
start of each period/interval. Ordinary annuity payments include loan repayments, mortgage payments, bond
interest payments, and dividend payments.
2. Present value: Another difference is that the present value of an annuity due is higher than one for an ordinary
annuity. It is a result of the time value of money principle, as annuity due payments are received earlier.
Hence, if you are set to make ordinary annuity payments, you will benefit from getting an ordinary annuity by
holding onto your money longer (for the interval). Conversely, if you are set to receive annuity due payments,
you will benefit, as you will be able to receive your money (value) sooner. In any annuity due, each payment is
discounted one less period in contrast to a similar ordinary annuity.

 Doubling Period
Investors commonly ask the question: How long would it take to double the amount at a given rate of interest?
To ascertain the doubling period, two rules are followed, i.e., Rule of 72 and Rule of 69.
      i)   Rule of 72: The Rule of 72 dates back to 1494 when Luca Pacioli referenced the rule in his comprehensive
           mathematics book called Summa de Arithmetica. Pacioli makes no derivation or explanation of why the
           rule may work, so some suspect the rule pre-dates Pacioli’s novel.
		 According to this rule of thumb the doubling period is obtained by dividing 72 by the interest rate. For

Time Value of Money                                                                                           LESSON 12

         example, if the interest rate is 8 percent, the doubling period is nearly 9 years (72/8). Likewise, if the
         interest rate is 4 percent the doubling period is nearly 18 years (72/4). Though somewhat crude, it is a
         handy and useful rule of thumb.
		The key takeaways of the Rule of 72 are as under:
          l   The Rule of 72 is a simplified formula that calculates how long it’ll take for an investment to
              double in value, based on its rate of return.
          l   The Rule of 72 applies to compounded interest rates and is reasonably accurate for interest rates
              that fall in the range of 6% and 10%.
          l   The Rule of 72 can be applied to anything that increases exponentially, such as GDP or inflation;
              it can also indicate the long-term effect of annual fees on an investment’s growth.
          l   This estimation tool can also be used to estimate the rate of return needed for an investment to
              double given an investment period.
          l   For different situations, it’s often better to use the Rule of 69, Rule of 70, or Rule of 73.
   ii)   Rule of 69: If you are inclined to a slightly more involved calculation, a more accurate rule of thumb is
         the rule of 69. According to this rule of thumb, the doubling period is equal to:

                      69
         0.35 +
                  Interest Rate
		 The following are the benefits of the rule of 69.
          l   It assumes that the interest is continuously compounding. In fact, it is true to think in the case of
              equity valuation that is compounding on an instant basis.
          l   It provides the answer very close to the answer obtained by using a financial calculator.
          l   It is even considered as the thumb rule of the investment return generating a cycle.
          l   Easy to calculate the time required.
          l   Even the retail investor or a non-finance person can easily determine the result.
          l   Can be used by any person without understanding the pure logic.
          l   Faster decision making and improve thought process.
		 The following are the limitations of the rule of 69.
          l   Difficult to explain the logic behind the number 69.
          l   Rule 69 does not apply to everything. Only the security like equity, which is compounding every
              minute, can provide the exact value (Rule 72 can Be help in those cases)
          l   If the rate is too less like 2/3 % Per annum, than the result is not very accurate. Generally, the
              higher rate is well captured by this formula.
          l   Projects with a heavy investment need specially designed spreadsheets because a minuscule
              difference in time and rate of interest value can create a difference of millions.
          l   Difficult to absorb the value derived because of non-transparency of value derivation.
          l   This rule covers those instruments which compounds continuously like equity shares, but it ignores
              the dividend component which is also received by the equity holder, so overall the share did not
              increase by an exact multiple of 2, but the dividend amount makes the value of it.


                                                                                                                   483

		 As an illustration of this rule of thumb, the doubling period is calculated for two interest rates, 10 percent
   and 15 percent.

                                  Interest Rate                  Doubling Period

                                    10 percent              0.35 + 69 /10 = 7.25 years

                                    15 percent              0.35 + 69 /15 = 4.95 years

   iii)    Rule of 70: The rule of 70 is used to determine the number of years it takes for a variable to double by
           dividing the number 70 by the variable’s growth rate. The rule of 70 is generally used to determine how
           long it would take for an investment to double given the annual rate of return.
		 For example, assume an investor invests $10,000 at a 10% fixed annual interest rate. He wants to
   estimate the number of years it would take for his investment to grow to $20,000. He uses the rule of
   70 and determines it would take approximately seven (70/10) years for his investment to double.

  Illustration 35:
  Due to the large capital needed to establish a factory and warehouse for coffee machines, Akshay have
  turned to private investors to fund the expenditure. He met with Jacob, who is a high net-worth individual
  willing to contribute $1,000,000 to Akshay’s company.
  However, Jacob is only willing to contribute the said amount on the presumption that he will get a 12%
  annual rate of return on his investment, compounded yearly. He wants to know how long it will take for his
  investment in Akshay’s company to double in value.
  Solution:
  Using the Rule of 72-
  Doubling time (number of years) = 72 /12% = 6 years.
  It will take approximately six years for Jacob’s investment to double in value.

   l Money has time value because of the following reasons:

           i)    Risk and Uncertainty. Future is always uncertain and risky.
           ii)   Inflation: In an inflationary economy, the money received today, has more purchasing power
                 than the money to be received in future.
          iii)   Consumption.
          iv)    Investment opportunities.
   l Time value of money is important because it helps investors and people saving for retirement determine
      how to get the most out of their dollars. This concept is fundamental to financial literacy and applies to
      your savings, investments and purchasing power.


                                                    GLOSSARY

  Annuity : An annuity is a series of equal cash flows paid at equal time intervals for a finite number
  of periods. A lease that calls for payments of $1000 each month for a year would be referred to as a
  “12-period, $1000 annuity.” Note that, strictly speaking, in order for a series of cash flows to be considered
  an annuity, each cash flow must be identical and the amount of time between each cash flow must be the
  same in all cases. There are two types of annuities that vary only in the timing of the first cash flow:
   l Regular Annuity – The first payment is made one period in the future (at period 1).
   l Annuity Due – The first payment is made immediately (at period 0).
  Graduated Annuity : A graduated annuity (also called a growing annuity) is a series of cash flows that
  increases over time at a constant rate for a finite number of periods. A common example of a graduated
  annuity would be a lottery payout.
  A lottery winner (e.g., Powerball) may opt to receive their winnings as a series of 30 annual payments (the
  first payment is immediate, and there are 29 additional annual payments). In the case of Powerball, each
  payment will be 4% greater than the previous payment. Note that, strictly speaking, a graduated annuity
  requires that the growth rate of the payments be constant for the life of the annuity.
  Lump Sum: A lump sum is a single cash flow. For example, an investment that is expected to pay $100 one
  year from now would have a “lump sum payment” of $100.
  Perpetuity: A perpetuity is simply a type of annuity that has an infinite life. In other words, it is a “perpetual
  annuity.”
  Uneven Cash Flow Stream: Any series of cash flows that doesn’t conform to the definition of an annuity
  is considered to be an uneven cash flow stream.
  Amortization Schedule: An amortization schedule is a table that shows each loan payment over the
  life of a loan, and a breakdown of the amount of interest and principal paid. Typically, it will also show
  the remaining balance after each payment has been made. Please see my tutorial on how to create an
  amortization schedule in Excel for more information.
  Cash Flow Sign Convention: This convention, used by financial calculators and spreadsheet functions,
  specifies that the sign (i.e., positive or negative numbers) indicates the direction of the cash flow. Cash
  inflows are entered as positive numbers, and cash outflows are entered as negative numbers. Failure
  to properly adhere to this convention will usually result in incorrect answers from your calculator or
  spreadsheet. Please note that whether a cash flow is an inflow (+) or outflow (-) depends on the part that
  you play in a transaction. For example, loan payments are an outflow (-) for the borrower, but an inflow (+)
  for the lender.

                                                                                                                  485
EP-CA&FM                                                                                         Time Value of Money


  Principle of Value Additivity: This fundamental principle states that the present value (future value) of a
  series of cash flows is the sum of the present value (future value) of each of the individual cash flows. For
  example, we can calculate the present value of an annuity by using a single formula, or by calculating the
  present value of each individual cash flow and then adding them together.
  This principle is very often useful for simplifying the calculation of the present or future value of uneven cash
  flow streams, particularly if the cash flows follow some identifiable pattern (such as several consecutive
  annuities).
  Rule of 72: A simple rule that can be used to approximate how long it will take a given amount of money
  to double at a particular interest rate. It can also be used to determine the interest rate that is required
  to double your money in a particular amount of time. To determine how long it will take to double your
  money, simply divide 72 by the interest rate (in decimal form).
  Compound Interest: This refers to the situation where, in future periods, interest is earned not only on the
  original principal amount, but also on the previously earned interest. This is a very powerful concept that
  means money can grow at an exponential rate.
  Compounding Frequency: This refers to how often interest is credited to the account. Once interest is
  credited it becomes, in effect, principal. Note that the compounding frequency and the frequency of cash
  flows are not always the same. In that case, the interest rate is typically adjusted to an effective rate that
  is of the same periodicity as the cash flows.
  Discount Rate: This is the interest rate that is used to convert between future values and present values.
  Note that the process of calculating present values is often referred to as “discounting” because present
  values are generally less than future values.
  Frequency of Cash Flows: When using the cash flow functions, many financial calculators prompt you
  for both the cash flow (CFx) and then the frequency (Fx or #Times). The frequency is simple a shortcut to
  save both time and memory. If a cash flow occurs more than one time in a row, then you would enter the
  number of times that it occurs (in most cases, you will leave it at 1). The next cash flow that is entered will
  be the next different cash flow.
  Future Value: This term refers to the value of a cash flow (or series of them) at some specific future time.
  Any cash flow that is scheduled to occur sometime later than today is referred to as a “future value.”
  Literally translated, future value means “what will it be worth at some future point in time?”

There are two types of expenditures generally made in a business viz. Capital Expenditure and Revenue
expenditure. Revenue expenditure is required for day to day operating requirements whereas Capital
expenditure is incurred in making investment in fixed assets. Following are some of its important definitions:
      1.   “Capital budgeting is long-term planning for making and financing proposed capital outlays.”
                                                                                           — Charles T. Horngren
   2.      “Capital budgeting involves the planning of expenditures for assets the returns from which will be
           realized in future time periods.”
                                                                                              — Milton H. Spencer
   3.      “Capital budgeting consists in planning the development of available capital for the purpose of
           maximizing the long-term profitability (return on investment) of the firm.”
                                                                                                    — R. M. Lynch
In general we can say that capital budgeting is the decisions regarding the investment of funds in the fixed
assets.

 IMPORTANCE OF CAPITAL BUDGETING
Capital budgeting is important not only because of high investment cost of capital projects, their irreversible
nature and permanent commitment and their long-run effects on the profitability of the concern, it is important
because of the following reasons also:
      1.   Capital budgeting highlights the possibilities of expansion of production facilities to cover up the
           additional demand shown in projected sales budget.
   2.       It shows comparative position of available different alternative assets for the replacement of old or
           obsolete assets.
   3.      It helps in long-term planning and formulation of policy. Appropriate time of purchase of assets and of
           improvement in the quality of purchased assets is known by proper capital budgeting.
   4.      It helps in estimating the total requirement of capital with its break-up over the years. This analysis
           helps in timely arrangement of funds required for the purpose.
   5.      It also helps in planning capital structure because the net surplus of a project depends on the cost of
           capital, which in its turn depends upon the capital structure of the firm.
   6.      Capital budgeting provides necessary information for cash forecasts and budget.
      7.   It helps in preparing a sound policy for depreciation and replacement of assets.
   8.      The firm can plan its dividend policy, which is in keeping with profit and wealth maximization objective
           of the firm as well as the necessary internal resource generation for further business expansion.
   9.      It can prove beneficial for considering the methods and measures to minimize cost. It can thus help in
           planning modernization of existing production facilities.
  10.      It highlights the desirability of replacement of men by machines.

 CAPITAL BUDGETING PROCESS
A capital budgeting process may involve a number of steps depending upon the size of the concern, nature of
projects, complexities and diversities. Following steps are necessary for a comprehensive capital budgeting
process:

                                         Fig 2.2 Capital Budgeting Process
1. Project Generation:
		First of all capital expenditure requirements should be forecasted. Capital expenditure proposals may
  originate at any level, i.e., from top management’s level to operative’s level. To facilitate the origination of
  such ideas a periodic review and comparison of earnings, costs, procedures and product-line should be
  made by the management on a continuous basis.
2. Project Evaluation:
		 This step involves:
    (i)   Estimating the costs and benefits in terms of cash flows, and
   (ii)   Selecting an appropriate criterion for judging the desirability of the projects.
  (iii)   Project evaluation based on selection with techniques.
          For project evaluation, different techniques (as discussed later on in this chapter) may be used.
3. Project Selection:
		 This step relates to the screening and selecting of the projects according to the criterion of the firm. This is
   done either by the financial manager or by a capital expenditure planning committee. After selecting the
   projects, priorities should be established of the accepted projects. It facilitates their execution and avoids
   delays and serious cost overruns. It also helps in capital rationing and better utilization of funds. The selected
   projects with details are submitted to top management for final approval.
4. Project Execution:
		 After selecting the best proposals and taking final approval of top management, funds are allocated for
   them. It is the duty of the executive committee to ensure that funds are spent in accordance with allocation
   made in the capital budgets. Periodical reports should be prepared and submitted to the controller to
   exercise control over such expenditures.
5. Follow-Up:
		 This step involves evaluation of the programme after its implementation. This involves comparison of actual
   performance with the budgeted data. Such follow up comparison will ensure better forecasting for the
   future. It has also the advantage of forcing the departmental heads to be more realistic in their approach
   and careful in actual execution of the projects.

 SCOPE OF CAPITAL BUDGETING DECISIONS
Broadly speaking, capital budgeting decisions are long-term investment decisions. They include the following:
(1) Expansion Decisions:
		 Decisions on the matters such as acquisition of new machinery of building, addition of building and machinery
   etc. are taken on the basis of cost of investment and expected profits from goods produced.
(2) Replacement Decisions:
		A company may have to replace its existing old or obsolete machinery by new and latest model machinery.


                                                                                                                491
EP-CA&FM                                                                                              Capital Budgeting

   The use of new machinery may bring down operating costs and increase the volume of output. Decisions
   on such matters are taken on the basis of saving on account of decrease in operating costs and profits from
   additional volume produced by new plant.
(3) Buy or Lease Decisions:
		 The management may have to take decision on acquiring a fixed asset by purchase it from the market or
   by arranging it on lease basis. Such decisions are taken by comparing the cost of funds required for the
   purchase of asset with the amount payable on lease.
(4) Choice of Equipment:
		The management may have to select the best machine out of available several alternative machines.
  Decisions on such matters are taken by comparing the cost of different assets with their respective
  profitability.
(5) Product of Process Improvement:
		 This concern with decision on matters related to cost reduction or improvement in the quality of product by
   change in production processes. Decision on such matters is taken on the basis of a comparative study of
   cost of change and possible additional income or saving as a result of change.

 COST AND BENEFITS OF PROJECT (CAPITAL BUDGETING DECISION)
For a capital budgeting decision, it is required to identify the cost and benefits involved in a project. These cost
and benefits are termed as cash flows (both inflow and outflow). We can justify such cash flows in terms of cost
and benefits as follows:




 Initial Investment / Outlay
When a new project is launched, there are so many expenditures are made to acquire that. Hence all the
expenditures incurred in zero time period (at initial stage) on an fixed assets (project) are called initial investment.
It includes:
      l   Cost of the project (Asset)
      l   Opportunity cost of the Asset
      l   Additional Working Capital involved.
Salvage Value or any scrap or wastage will be subtracted from the value said above. We can compute the
value of initial investment as follows:

 Net Annual Cash Inflows
An investment is made with a specific purpose of getting satisfied return especially in term of cash inflows.
When cash inflows from a project regularly with same amount throughout the life of the project (with variation
year to year), is called net annual cash inflows. This is net income of the firm before charging depreciation and
after tax. This may be computed as follows:
                             Computing Net Cash Inflows (Operating Cash flows)

 Annual Sale Income (revenue)                                                                               ****

 CAPITAL BUDGETING TECHNIQUES
The ultimate objective of the capital budgeting process is to achieve maximum benefit from the project. For this
purpose, there are various techniques of capital budgeting which are as follows:




 PAYBACK PERIOD METHOD
When one invests an amount in any type of investment, he/she always worries about the length of time for
getting invested money back, same happens in a firm too. When a firm goes to invest an amount in purchasing
any fixed asset, it explores the alternatives available which may provide cash back soon.
In this process, the payback period is most identified and popular method of capital budgeting to evaluate the
proposals for the purpose of capital expenditure. Payback period is that time period in which net cash inflow
from investment recovers the cost of investment.

                  The payback period is the duration to recover the initial cost of the project.

Under this method, the proposal is to be selected which are time conscious i.e. the project which will take least
time to pay back the amount invested will be preferred. If numbers of proposals are available then these will be
ranked on the basis of their estimated time consumption and selected accordingly.

Advantages or Merits of Payback Method

    1.   It is simple to calculate and easy to understand, apply and interpret.

   2.    It is realistic in approach as businessmen want speedy recovery of their money in capital assets.

   3.    It weights early returns heavily and ignores distant returns and thus short payback period acts as a
         hedge against a boon decision.

   4.    It is safe since it avoids incalculable risk and uncertainty in the long run.

Limitations or Demerits of Payback Method

Major shortcomings of this method are as follows:

    1.   This method is a ‘crude rule of thumb’ and over-emphasizes early recovery of invested funds. Of course,
         liquidity in itself is an important factor but ignoring ‘profitability of investment’ and concentrating, only
         on ‘liquidity of investment’ can in no way be justified in most of the situations.

   2.    It concentrates only on the ‘recovering of the cost of investment’ and does not consider the earnings
         after the payback period.

   3.    It considers only the payback period of the project and not its whole life.

   4.    This method ignores the risk factor in investments. Hence, projects with higher risk but lower payback
         period will be accepted as compared to a project with lower risk and higher payback period.

   5.    This method does not consider the ‘cost of capital’ which is an important base of sound investment
         decisions.

   6.    This method ignores the time value of money. It fails to consider varying cash flow patterns. All cash
         flows are treated and weighted equally, regardless of the time period of their occurrence.

    7.   This method ignores the salvage value of the asset.

   8.    It is not possible to calculate rate of return by this method.

The payback period is calculated as follows:

(A) In the Case of Even Cash Inflows:

		 If cash inflows from investment are uniform throughout the life of investment, payback period is calculated
   by dividing the cost of investment with the amount of annual cash inflow. As per formula:

                    Initial Investment
     PBP =
               New Annual Cash flow
		
 For example, a project with an initial outlay of Rs. 20,000 yields annual cash inflow of Rs. 5,000 for seven
 years, the payback period of the project will be:

             20,000
     =                   4 Years
             5,000




                                                                                                                 495

                  Less Tax @ 50%                                                                  40,000
                  Profit after tax                                                                40,000
                  Add back Depreciation @ 12% on Rs. 5,00,000                                     60,000

                              Cost of Product          300000
      Rate of Return =                             =              = 3 Years
                             Annual Cash flow          100000


(B) In the Case of Uneven Cash Inflows:
		If cash inflows from investment are not uniform each year, payback period will be calculated by taking
  cumulative total of each year’s cash inflows and the exact payback period will be calculated by interpolation.
  Pay back period will be calculated as:

                  B
      PBP = E +
                  C
		 Where, E = number of years immediately preceding the year of final recovery
		 B = the balance amount still to be recovered
		 C = cash flow during the year of final recovery

 A project with an outlay of Rs. 12,000 yields Rs. 2,000, Rs. 3,000, Rs. 4,000 and Rs. 6,000 respectively in

 Post Payback Profitability (P.P.B. Profit)
A major weakness of the traditional payback period method is that it ignores the profitability of post-payback
period. Hence, it remains the test of liquidity and not of profitability of investments. Therefore, experts have
suggested that post-payback profitability should also be calculated and compared to evaluate the relative
profitability of various capital projects.
It is calculated as follows:

                 Post Payback Profitability = Annual Cash Inflows (Working Life – Payback Period)

Alternatively,
Note: Salvage value of asset will be included in the earnings of last year.

                        Post Payback Profitability = Total Cash Inflows – Investment Outlay

Other things being equal, the project with highest post-payback profitability will be the best. Higher the post-
payback profitability, more attractive will be the project. If cost of various projects differs substantially, post
payback profitability index may be calculated to assess the relative profitability of the projects.
It is calculated as thus :

                                                                    PPB Profits
                             Post Payback Profitability Index =                   X 100
                                                                    Investments

 DISCOUNTED PAYBACK PERIOD
An important weakness of payback method is that it ignores the time factor of cash inflows from investment. To
overcome this weakness, discounted payback period may be calculated. Under this method at first the annual
cash inflows are discounted at the required earnings rate (or cut off rate) and then these discounted cash
inflows are cumulated and payback period is calculated with the help of these figures.

  Illustration 4:
  Calculate discounted payback period from the information given below:

   = 3 years and 8 days

 Accounting Rate of Return Method (ARR Method)
This method is also known as unadjusted rate of return method or Financial Statement Method because the
main figures used in the calculation are derived from accounting statements. Under this method, percentage
rate of return of the annual net profit on investment is calculated. If it is calculated on initial investment, it is
called Return on Investment (ROI) and if it is calculated on average investment, it is called as Average Rate
of Return. Usually, it is calculated on average investment in the project. If annual net income fluctuates then
average annual net income is used into the calculation. Thus, the formula for calculating this return is as follows:

                                      Average Annual Net Income (Savings)
                              AAR =                                             X 100
                                               Average Investment

Evaluation of Project under ARR method:
Rate of return calculated as above is compared with the cutoff or the pre-specified rate of return. If the return
is more than the cut-off rate, the project would be accepted, if not, it would be rejected. In the evaluation of
mutually exclusive projects, only such projects are considered, whose accounting rates of returns are more
than the cut-off rate and the project with the highest rate is selected. The larger is the rate, better is the project.
Advantages or Merits of Unadjusted Rate of Return Method
      1.   It is simple to compute and easy to understand and interpret.
   2.      It takes into consideration the total earnings from the project during the its entire economic life.
   3.      This method gives due weight to the profitability of the project.
   4.      This method duly recognizes the concept of net earnings, i.e., earnings after providing for depreciation
           on capital asset. In fact, this is the correct way of income determination.
   5.      This method ignores the life of the project for determining the cost of investment. Hence, the amount of
           initial investment and average investment remain the same.
Limitations or Demerits of Unadjusted Rate of Return Method
      1.   It is simply an averaging technique, which does not take into account the impact of various external
           factors on overall profits of the firm.
   2.      It ignores the life of the project and differentiates against the projects of lower economic life.
   3.      It ignores the time value of earnings. In other words, this method does not discount the future earnings
           to present value.
   4.      The method does not determine the fair rate of return on investments. It is left at the discretion of
           management.
   5.      This method does not give consideration to the risk factor in respect of each project. Risk analysis
           should be the integral part of a project evaluation technique.

  Conclusion:
  Though ROI of Machine X is more than 20% its payback period is more than 3 years, hence this machine
  will be rejected. Machine Y will be selected because of its payback being less than 3 years and ROI more
  than 20%.

 PRESENT VALUE METHOD
This is the method which follows the concept of real time factor. It involves the value of time in transactions.
This method is popularly known as ‘discounted cash flow method’ because in this method all future cash flows
(inflows and outflows both) of an investment project which occur at different times are discounted at a given rate
to bring them at a common denominator and make them comparable.
Discounting is a procedure of bringing future inflows and outflows of cash to their present values. In general, money
received today is valued more than money receivable tomorrow. “A bird in hand is worth more than the two in the
bush” is rightly applicable to the management of capital. Therefore, in this technique, all future inflows and outflows
a cash of an investment project are brought to technique, all future inflows and outflows of cash of an investment
project are brought to their present values by applying a discounting rate (i.e., cost of capital or interest rate).

                        What you have today is more worthy than what will you have in future

Calculating Present Value:
The present value of future cash flows is found out with the help of the following algebraic formula:

                                                                       S
                                             Present Value (P) =
                                                                     (1+i)n
Where, P = Value of a future sum of money
            S = Future value of a sum of money
            i = Rate of interest
            n = number of years

 PRESENT VALUE METHODS
There are three methods of appraising the profitability of capital investment projects by present value technique:




(A) Net Present Value Method (NPV Method)
This is also known as Excess Present Value Method or Net Gain Method. This method is used when the
management has prescribed minimum (or target) rate of return or cut-off rate. Following steps are involved in
this method:
      (i)   Determine the present value of all cash inflows from investments at different periods at required
            earnings rate. The formula is:
                              Present Value = Annual Cash Inflow x Present Value Factor

Note:
It should be remembered that salvage value and working capital released at the end of the project’s life are
considered as cash inflows of the last year and are duly discounted to present values.
   (ii)     Determine the present value of all cash outflows at different periods at the same earnings rate. Cash
            outflows at zero period of time (initial investment including working capital needed, if any) are not
            discounted. For this amount, the present value factor is taken as 1. However, cash outflows at subsequent
            periods are discounted by the relevant present value factor.
  (iii)     Find out the present value. For this, total of present values of all cash inflows is compared with the total
            of present values of all cash outflows. As per formula:
          Net Present Value = Total Present Value of Cash Inflows - Total Present Value of Cash Outflows
DECISION RULE
   (i)      If NPV is positive, project is accepted.
   (ii)     If NPV is zero, the project is accepted or rejected on non-economic considerations.
  (iii)     If NPV is negative, the project is rejected.
Higher the NPV, more attractive will be the project. Hence, in mutually exclusive projects, (if cost of investment
is similar), the project which gives the higher positive NPV will be preferred.
Merits of NPV Method
    1.      The NPV method recognizes the time value of money and takes into consideration the cost of capital.
   2.       It is very easy to calculate and simple to understand and interpret.
   3.       It takes care of the entire life of the project and its entire earnings including salvage of asset.
   4.       It can be applied to both types of cash inflow patterns – even and uneven cash inflows.
   5.       The economists generally prefer this method as it is consistent with the objective of maximizing owners’
            wealth.
Limitation or Demerits of NPV Method
    1.      Compared to payback or accounting rate of return methods, NPV method is difficult and complicated.
   2.       The greatest problem of this method is determination of desired rate of return. Due to difference in the
            state of risk and uncertainty of different business, no uniform rate can be used.
   3.       Keeping in view time-span of different projects and difference of risk inherent in them, use of a common
            discounting rate is not correct.
   4.       It may also not give satisfactory results where the projects under competition have different lives. NPV
            method favors long-lived projects.
   5.       It assumes that intermediate cash inflows are reinvested at the firm’s cost of capital, which is always not
            true.
   6.       The results from this method may contradict those under internal rate of return method, even in the
            case of alternative proposals, which are mutually exclusive.
    7.      Net present value is sensitive to discount rates. With a change in rate, a desirable project may turn into
            an undesirable one and vice-versa.

(B) Profitability Index Method or Present Value Index Method
The Profitability index method is a variant of NPV method and is called benefit-cost ratio. It is preferable to the
NPV method where capital costs of mutually exclusive projects differ substantially. It expresses the relationship
between present values of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows (i.e., cost of investment). The
formula is:

                                   Present Value of Cash Inflows
P.V. Index (on Re. 1) =
                                  Present Value of Cash Outflows

                                  Present Value of Cash Inflows
P.V. Index (percentage) =                                           X 100
                                  Present Value of Cash Outflows


The main object of the use of present value index is to provide ready comparability between investment
proposals of different magnitude. A proposal can be accepted only if profitability index is greater than or at
least equal to unity. Higher the index, more desirable is the investment. The proposal is rejected if its profitability
index is less than one. But, it is to be noted that profitability index of less than one does not indicate loss. It
simply means that the firm’s cost of capital exceeds the rate of return making it imperative for the proposal to
be rejected.

      The only difference between NPV method and PV index method is that while the former indicates
                          absolute figures, the latter indicates the relative figures.

 (C) TIME ADJUSTED RATE OF RETURN METHOD (TAR Method) or INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN
 METHOD (IRR Method)
This rate is also known as ‘Marginal Efficiency of Investment’, ‘Internal Rate of Project’ and ‘Breakeven Rate’.
It follows the discounted cash flow technique, which takes into account the time value of money. This is why, this
rate is called as time adjusted rate. This method is used when the management does not prescribe desirable
rate of return.
Under this method, such a rate of return (or discounting rate) is derived at which the aggregate of the present
values of all future cash inflows from investment equals the present value of cash outflows for the proposal (i.e.,
initial investment outlay). In other words, IRR is the maximum rate of interest that could be paid for the capital
employed over the life on an investment without loss on the project. It is the rate of discount at which net present
value is zero. Higher the IRR, more attractive is the proposal. A proposal is accepted only when IRR is higher
than the required rate of return (cut-off rate). If it is lower, the proposal is rejected; if it is just equal decision is
taken on the basis of other considerations. In case of mutually exclusive projects, project with highest IRR is
selected.

Computation of IRR
A) In the case of even cash Inflows:
If cash inflows are uniform each year, the computation of IRR involves the following two steps:
      (i)   Calculate Present Value Factor (or Payback Reciprocal):
		 The following formula is applied for this purpose:

                                        Investment
             P.V. Factor =
                                Annual Cash Inflows
   (ii)     Finding Rate of Return:
		Locate the factor closest to the factor calculated in (i) in the compound present value table (Table 2)
  in the row of year corresponding the life span of investment in years. The interest rate of the column
  of that factor will be the required IRR. For example, if an investment outlay of Rs. 10,432 yields cash
  earnings of Rs. 2,000 each year for 10 years, IRR is calculated as follows:

                                   Investment                     10,432
             P.V. Factor =                                  =                 = 5.216
                              Annual Cash Inflows                  2,000
Locating this factor in the compound P.V. Table in the row corresponding to the life span of investment in years
(i.e., tenth year), the factor is an interest rate of 14%s. Hence, IRR in this case is 14%.
Note:
It is always not possible that the same factor as calculated in (i) above is there in the present value table. It may
exist between any two factors in the table. In such a case, IRR is determined on the basis of closest factor. The
actual rate can, however, be calculated by applying interpolation technique, although such accuracy is usually
not required in the appraisal of the projects.
The formula for interpolation is:

                                                                V1 - V
                                                 r = r1 +                  (r2 – r1)
                                                                V1 – V2
where, r = rate of return to be determined
            r1 = lower rate of return
            r2 = higher rate of return
            V1 = the p.v. factor at lower rate of return
            V2 = the p.v. factor at higher rate of return
            V = the p.v. factor for which r is to be interpolated.
B) In the Case of Uneven Cash Inflows:
The calculation of IRR under such circumstances is a little bit difficult. In this case, ‘trial and error’ procedure
is followed to find out IRR. Here also the object is the same. We have to determine the rate at which the total
present value of irregular and uneven cash inflows equals the cost of investment (or total present value of cash
outflows), i.e., where NPV is zero. The following procedure may be followed in such a case:
      (i)   Calculate the average annual cash inflows to get a fake annuity.
   (ii)     Determine ‘fake payback factor’ by dividing the initial outlay with the average annual cash inflows.

  (iii)   Locate the factor in compound P.V. Table closest to the fake present value factor in the same manner as
          in the case of annuity and determine the fake IRR.
  (iv)    Calculate present value of cash inflows at the fake rate determined above in (iii) and compare the total
          present value of cash inflows with the cost of investment. If NPV is positive, a higher rate should be tried
          to calculate NPV. Conversely, if NPV is negative, a lower rate should be tried. The procedure will go on
          till we find the rate at which NPV is zero.
Alternatively, two discounting rates may be selected in such a way that the NPV result of the lower rate of
discount is a positive amount and the NPV result of the higher discounting rate is a negative amount. Then the
interpolation technique should be applied to arrive at the correct IRR.
Merits of TAR or IRR Method
    1.    Like NPV, IRR method takes into consideration time value of money and also the total cash inflows and
          outflows over the entire life of the project.
   2.     The pre-determination of earnings rate is not a pre-condition for the use of this method.
   3.     For a manager, it is easier to understand and interpret the ‘rate’ than an absolute amount.
Demerits of TAR or IRR Method
    1.    Its computation is difficult. IRR requires tedious calculations based on trial and error procedure or
          interpolation.
   2.     The assumption that cash flows are reinvested for the remaining life of the project at the IRR is unrealistic.
          In some cases, it remains idle in the business.
   3.     This method requires the determination of minimum required rate of return to know the acceptability of
          IRR, which is a difficult task.
   4.     If cash inflows in any years are negative then it may give more than one solution.
   5.     This method does not differentiate satisfactorily between projects of different lives.

  Illustration 8:
  A project costs Rs. 10,000 and cash inflows in the first, second, third and fourth years respectively is Rs.
  2,000, Rs. 3,000, Rs. 5,000 and Rs. 6,000. Calculate time adjusted rate of return for the project.
  Solution:
          Total Cash Inflows of 4 years = Rs. 16,000
          Average Annual Cash Inflow = Rs. 4,000

                      10000
   P.V. Factor =                =2.5
                     40000
  Locating this factor in cumulative P.V. Table on the line corresponding to the 4th year, TAR is found to be
  about 22%. Now, we have to verify this TAR as follows:

                     Year         Cash Inflow           P.V. Factor at 22%           Present Value

  As the total present value of cash-inflows at 22% is less than the cost of investment, the TAR must be
  below 22%. Because the difference between these two figures is quite large, so we take out next trial at
  16%.

                            Year   Cash Inflow           P.V. Factor at 16%          Present Value

  As it is clear from the above, the total present value of cash inflows at 16% is more than the cost of
  investment, so the TAR is some where between 16% and 22% and the exact rate can be found out by
  interpolation as follows:

                                                         V1 - V
                                             r = r1 +                (r2 – r1)
                                                        V1 – V2

                                                   10,470 – 10,000
                                       r = 16 +                          (22 – 16)
                                                    10,470 – 9,117
                                                        = 18.08%
Modified IRR
The limitation of IRR is that reinvestment rate in case of IRR is IRR itself. This can be overcome changing the
reinvestment rate incorporating the expected reinvestment rate for future periods over the life of the projects and
using such expected reinvestment rate for calculating the terminal value of the cash inflows for different years of the
life of the project. Thereafter, MIRR is determined with present value of such terminal value of thecash inflows and
present value of the cash outflows. In other words, the MIRR is the discount rate which will make present / discounted
value of terminal value of cash inflows equal to present/discounted value of cash outflow.
The procedure for calculating MIRR is as follows:
Step 1: Calculated the present Value of the costs (PVC) associated with the project, using the cost of capital
(r) as the discount rate:

        n     Cash outflow t_
PVC=   ∑
       t =0        (1+r)t

Step 2: Calculate the terminal Value (TV) of the cash inflow expected from the project:

        n

TV=    ∑ Cash Inflow (1+ r)
       t =0
                                t     n-t




Step 3: Obtain MIRR by solving the following equation:

              n       TV
PVC=     ∑  t =0   (1+ MIRR)n

To illustrate the calculation of MIRR let us consider an example. Srivastava Limited is evaluating a project that
has the following cash flow stream associated with it:

                   Year               0        1         2           3             4               5             6

       Cash Flow                    -120    -80         20          60           80               100         120

The cost of capital is 15 percent. The percent value of costs will be : 120 + 80 / 1.15 = 189.6
1.15
The terminal value of cash inflow is:
20(1.15) 4 + 60(1.15)3 + 80 (1.15)2 + 100(1.15) + 120
= 34.98 +91.26 + 105.76 + 115+120 = 467
The MIRR is obtained as follows:
                          467
 189.6 =
                      (1+MIRR)6

(1+MIRR)6 = 2.463
1+ MIRR= 2.463 1/6 = 1.162
MIRR= 1.162 or 16.2 percent
Modified NPV or Modified IRR may be used to resolve the conflict in ranking of the alternative projects under
NPV and IRR methods arising out of differences in timing of cash flows, i.e., in one project, the cash inflows in
the initial years may be more than the other or vice versa.
In case of mutually exclusive projects, financial appraisal using NPV & IRR methods may provide conflicting
results. The reasons for such conflicts may be attributed to (i) Difference in timing / pattern of cash inflows of
the alternative proposals (Time Disparity), (ii) difference in their amount of investment (Size Disparity) and (iii)
difference in the life of the alternative proposals (Life Disparity).
TIME DISPARITY: Main source of conflict is the different re-investment rate assumption. Such conflicts may be
resolved using modified version of NPV and IRR using expected / defined reinvestment rate applicable to the
firm.
For modified NPV and IRR, at first Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the specified reinvestment rate. TV=
“CF(1+r*)n-t MNPV = {TV ÷ (1+K)n}-IMIRR=(TV÷I)1/n-1
Where, r*t = reinvestment rate

                                                                            I                                       II

 IRR (appx.)                                                           22%                                      25%

According to NPV, Project I is better but according to IRR, Project II is better. So, there is conflicting results. The
primary reason for such conflict is the difference in timing of cash inflows. In case of Project II, more cash inflows
occur in the initial years while in case of Project I more cash flows occur towards the end of the project. Such
conflict may be resolved using Modified version of NPV or IRR (MNPV or MIRR) as follows.
Using reinvestment rate of 14%,
TV1 = 62000 (1 + .14)3 + 80000 (1 + .14)2 + 100000 (1 + .14)1 + 140000 (1 + .14)0 = 449822
TV2 = 142000 (1 + .14)3 + 80000 (1 + .14)2 + 82000 (1 + .14)1 + 40000 (1 + .14)0 = 447822
MNPVI= {449822 ÷ (1 +.10)4} – 220000 = 87228
MNPVII = {447822 ÷ (1 +.10)4} – 220000 = 85862
MIRRI = (449822 ÷220000)1/4 – 1 = 19.57%
MIRRII = (447822 ÷220000)1/4 – 1 = 19.32%
Both the MIRR and MNPV show that Project I should be accepted.
SIZE DISPARITY:
Conflict may arise due to disparity in the size of initial investment /outlays. Such conflict may be resolved using
incremental approach.
Steps :
      l   Find out the differential cash flows between the two proposals
      l   Calculate the IRR of the incremental cash flows
      l   If the IRR of the differential cash flows exceeds the required rate of return (usually cost of capital), the
          project having greater non-discounted net cash flows should be selected.

             K = 10%

Solution: At first, NPV and IRR of the projects are calculated and it has been found that,NPVA<NPVB IRRA> IRRB
The above results indicate that there is a conflict in ranking of the projects under NPV and IRR. Such conflict is
mainly due to the difference in the initial investment of the projects and it can be resolved using incremental
approach as follows.
Differential Cash Outflows = r 2500000, Differential Net Cash Inflows = r2900000
We know that IRR is the discount rate at which Present Value of Cash Inflows are equal to the Present Value of
Cash Outflows.
So, 25, 00,000 = 29, 00,000 / (1+ r)1
Or, 1 + r = 29,00,000/25,00,000 Or, r = 1.16 – 1 = 0.16
IRR (r) of the differential cash flows = 16%, which is greater than Cost of Capital (k). Therefore, Project with higher
non- discounted cash inflows, i.e., Project B would be selected.
Advantages and Disadvantages of the MIRR Method
The modified internal rate of return resolves two problems inherent to the IRR.
All cash inflows are reinvested at the reinvestment rate, which is more realistic than reinvesting at the IRR.
The method of calculation eliminates the problem of multiple IRR for projects with abnormal cash flows.
The main disadvantage of the MIRR method is the potential conflict with the NPV method. The reason may be
due to a difference in project scale or in the timing of cash flows (the problem was discussed in “NPV vs IRR
method”). Furthermore, if the reinvestment rate is lower than the cost of capital, there is a conflict with the basic
assumption of the NPV method, which is that all expected cash inflows are reinvested at the cost of capital
(discount rate).Thus, the project can simultaneously have positive NPV and MIRR lower than the cost of capital.
That is the reason why some academic studies recommend using the reinvestment rate equal to the cost of
capital raised for a project.

 Unequal lives of the Projects or LIFE DISPARITY
In some cases, the mutually exclusive alternatives with different/ unequal lives may lead to conflict in ranking.
To resolve such conflict, one approach is to compare the alternatives on the basis of their Equivalent Annual
Benefit (EAB) or Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC) and select the alternative with the higher EAB or lower EAC.
EAB = NPV x Capital Recovery Factor or NPV ÷ PVIFAk,n
Capital Recovery Factor = the inverse of PVIFA = k (1+k)n ÷ (1+k)n - 1
EAC = PV of Cost ÷ PVIFAk.n
Another approach is to evaluate the alternatives over an equal time frame using the lowest common multiple
(LCM) of the lives of the alternatives under consideration. This method is referred to as LCM method. For example,
life of Proposal A is 3 Years and that of B is 5 years. Lowest common multiple period is 15 years, during which

                                                                                                                  513

period, it may be assumed that Machine A will be replaced 5 times and Machine B will be replaced 3 times.
Cash Flows are extended to this period and computations made. The final results would then be on equal
platform i.e. equal years, and hence would be comparable.
Example:

                                                                          P                 Q
                       Investment (Rs.):                        5000000             5000000
                       Cash Inflows (Rs.):

                       Year 3                                                       7000000
                       K = 12%
                       Solution.
                                                                          P                 Q
                       NPV (Rs.)                                 1696400            3362800

From the above, it is found that there is conflict in ranking of the projects under NPV and IRR. The reason may
be attributed primarily to the unequal lives, i.e., life disparity. In such situation, EAB approach may be followed
as follows.

                                                                     P                       Q

Based on EAB, Project P is better.

 CAPITAL RATIONING
One important aspect of control device is to match the demand schedule for the capital for the company and
the supply of capital from different sources. Demand comes for capital from all departments and it is at this
level control could be exercised to keep the demand at the bare minimum required for the objective inherent
in capital investment decisions. Supply of capital, on the other hand, is a scarce commodity and the company
has to incur expenditure for availing it. This necessitates for the finance manager to exercise economy in capital
expenditure so that optimum benefit could be obtained with the use of scarce capital sources. This establishes
the need for capital rationing to impose constraints on capital expenditure under prevailing market conditions
and place self-imposed constraints to check the funds being raised from outside agencies like borrowings.
Thus, the device of capital rationing is adopted to control capital expenditure.
The firm may put a limit to the maximum amount that can be invested during a given period of time, such as a
year. Such a firm is then said to be resorting to capital rationing. A firm with capital rationing constraint attempts
to select the combination of investment projects that will be within the specified limits of investments to be made
during a given period of time and at the same time provide greatest profitability.
Capital rationing may be effected through budget ceiling. A firm may resort to capital rationing when it follows

Capital Budgeting                                                                                       LESSON 13

the policy of financing investment proposals only by ploughing back its retained earnings. In that case, capital
expenditure in a given period cannot exceed the amount of retained earnings available for reinvestment.
Management may also introduce capital rationing when a department is authorised to make investments upto
a limit beyond which investment decisions will be made by higher level management.
Capital rationing may result in accepting several small investment proposals then accepting a few large
investment proposals so that there may be full utilisation of budget ceiling. This may result in accepting
relatively less profitable investment proposals if full utilization of budget is a primary consideration. Similarly,
capital rationing also means that the firm foregoes the next most profitable investment falling after the budget
ceiling even though it is estimated to yield a rate of return much higher than the required rate of return. Thus,
capital rationing does not lead optimum results.

 Types of capital rationing
    1.   “hard” or external
   2.    “soft” or internal
Hard capital rationing occurs when external factors force a company to cut expenses, including capital
expenditures. For example, creditors may include provisions in an agreement limiting borrowers’ spending to
reduce the risk of default. Many companies are also forced to reduce spending when they are going to raise
additional capital by issuing new debt or equity. The objective of such a strategy is to increase the free cash
flow and therefore make a company more attractive to investors. As we can see, external factors may cause
severe constraints on the capital budget.
Soft capital rationing is caused by internal factors. For example, to reduce overall risk, the board of directors
may set a minimum internal rate (IRR) of return for capital projects. All projects having a lower IRR will be
rejected even though they have a positive net present value. Dividend policy can also cause soft rationing. For
example, if a company declares paying a fixed dividend per share, any failure will be negatively perceived by
the market and will most likely result in a decrease in the stock price. That is why company management would
prefer to cut capital expenditures than dividends.
A company has a budget constraint of 3 lakh for Capital expenditure and is considering five projects using the
net present value method. The particulars are:

                     Project                   Project cost (r)            Net Present value (r)

                        A                             1,80,000                            75,000

Assuming that project B and C are mutually exclusive and all other project are independent, select the
combination which all maximise the net present value.

Under condition of Capital Rationing, raking of the project is done under the profitability index as follow:

3,00,000 of the project cost is recommended.
Note: Since B and C are mutually project, they cannot be considered simultaneously.

 CONSIDERATION OTHER THAN PROFITABILITY IN MANAGERIAL DECISIONS
Managerial decision on capital projects is very difficult and complicated problem. Though profitability of the
proposal is the crucial factor that influences the capital expenditure decisions this cannot be the sole determinant
for these decisions. In practice there are many other factors which make the profitability base subsidiary or less
important. These factors are as follows:
1. Urgency of the Project:
Sometimes an investment is made due to urgency to avoid heavy losses. For example, on breakdown of
machinery, management may decide to replace it by any available machine suitable for the work without
proper evaluation of its cost and benefits so as to avoid heavy losses due to stoppage of production process.
In such a case, the basis of managerial decision is urgency and not the profitability.
2. Funds Available:
The availability of funds is an important factor that influences the capital budgeting decisions. Sometimes,
a more profitable project is not taken up for want of sufficient funds and a lesser profitable project of lower
payback period is approved, if the firm is short of funds.
3. Available Technical Know-how and Managerial Capability:
Before approving a project, the management will have to consider whether their firm has got the necessary
technical know-how and managerial capability to implement that project and if not, whether it could be acquired.

4. Availability of Additional Funds:
If the management is capable of arranging additional funds in
future, then all the funds available at present may be utilized
for the capital projects; if not, working capital needs will have
to be arranged out of the funds available with the firm.
5. Fuller Utilization of Funds:
The ultimate goal of managerial policy is to maximize the
owner’s wealth. Hence, if the firm has ample funds for investment
then a project yielding highest rate of return and requiring
lesser outlay may not be approved by the management if no
other profitable investment of spare funds is possible. In such a
situation, it may be better to select the next best project if total
funds of the concern could be invested in the project, so that
total profits of the firm are maximized.
6. Future Expectations of Earnings:
Expected earnings on future investments may also influence
current capital investment decisions. If more profitable
investments are possible in future, then at present management
would select the project of lower useful life so that the funds
invested may be taken back early and could be invested in
future in more profitable projects. On the contrary, if there is
possibility of rate of return on investment to go down then long
economic life projects would be better even if rate of return on
this project is lower to a short live project.
7. Degree of Certainty of Net Income:
Certainty of income on project also influences the selection of the project. Although future business operations
are uncertain, even then the management may select a lower income project in place of a higher but uncertain
income project.
8. Risk of Obsolescence:
In case of rapid technological development, the project with a lesser payback period may be preferred in
comparison to one which may have higher profitability but still longer payback period.
9. Maintaining Market Share:
Sometimes, the management may take a decision in favor of a project though yielding a lower return but
necessary to maintain earning capacity and existing market share of the firm.

 RISK AND UNCERTAINTY IN CAPITAL BUDGETING
The cash flows from an investment are estimated when the proposal is evaluated; however, the returns are not
known until the cash flow actually occurs. The uncertainty of returns from the moment the funds are invested
until management and investor know how much the projects has earned, is a primary determinant of a proposal’s
risk. The owners of a firm are ordinarily concerned with the riskiness of their capital, and management must
therefore, take risk into account in evaluation of capital budgeting proposals.
In case, the cash flows associated with a proposal are known with certainty then the techniques such as NPV,


                                                                                                            517
EP-CA&FM                                                                                           Capital Budgeting

IRR or any other may be used to evaluate the desirability of the proposal. However, when the cash flows are not
known with certainty a measure of risk of the proposal should also be brought into the evaluation system. Such
resultant capital budgeting decisions criterion will then evaluate the proposals by considering both the risk and
return associated with the proposal.
MEASURES OF RISK / RISK EVALUATION
Measurements cannot be assured of cent per cent accuracy because risk is caused by numerous factors such
as social, political, economic and managerial efficiency. Measurement provides an approximate quantification
of risk.
The following techniques can be applied to evaluate the risk presented in the chart given below:




                                               F-1.6 Risk Evaluation

 1. Risk Adjusted Discount Rate (RADR)
This discount rate is applicable to a risky investment and is the sum of risk free rate and a risk premium relating
to that investment. It is also known as “Varying Discount Rate Method”. Under this method the discount rate is
adjusted in accordance with the degree of risk.
                             RADR = Risk Free Rate of Retun + Risk Premium Rate
This is a simplest method of accounting for risk in capital budgeting is to increase the cut-off rate or the discount
factor by certain percentage on account of risk. The projects which are more risky and which have greater
variability in expected returns should be discounted at a higher rate as compared to the projects which are less
risky and are expected to have lesser variability in returns.

  			                    = Rs. (-) 5,885
  Investment B
  Net Present value     = Rs. 1,04,820 – 1,00,000
  			                   = Rs. 4,820
  As even at a higher discount rate investment B gives a higher net present value, investment B should be
  preferred.

 2. Certainty Equivalent Technique
In this method, Cash flows are corrected and reduced to conservative levels by multiplying them by certainty
equivalent co-efficient (or correction factor).

                                                                  Riskless Cash Flows
                        Certainty Equivalent Co-efficient =
                                                                   Risky Cash Flows
This is another simple method of accounting for risk in capital budgeting is to reduce expected cash flows by
certain amounts. It can be employed by multiplying the expected cash flows by certainly equivalent co-efficient
as to convert the uncertain cash flows to certain cash flows.

 3. PROBABILITY TECHNIQUE
Probability is the at most chances of happening of a certain event. The probability lies between 0 and 1. If any
chance is sure to be happened then it will carry probability 1 (which mean no probability at all but certainty).
Under this method, the cash inflows estimates are multiplied by the probability assigned to them. The result

would be expected monetary values. Then these expected monetary values will be discounted at a discount
rate available for present value.
A probability is the relative frequency with which an event may occur in the future. When future estimates of
cash inflows have different probabilities the expected monetary values may be computed by multiplying cash
inflow with the probability assigned. The monetary values of the inflows may further be discounted to find out
the present values. The project that gives higher net present value may be accepted.

  As net present value of Project Y is more than that of Project X after taking into consideration those

 4. STANDARD DEVIATION
The statistical tool often used to measure and used as a proxy for risk is the standard deviation. It is measure
of the values of the variables around its mean or it is the square root of the sum of the squared deviations from
the mean divided by the number of observances. The arithmetic mean of the returns may be same for two
companies but the returns may vary widely.


                                                                                                                             521
EP-CA&FM                                                                                          Capital Budgeting


             Standard Deviation is the measure of variability of cash flow from the expected cash flow.

Standard deviation in the probability distribution is as:

                                          Standard Deviation (σ) = √∑ Pid2

Where d =           Deviation of each of the cash flows
            Pi =    Associated probability
Advantages of Standard Deviation
The standard deviation and variance are conceptually equivalent quantitative measures of total risk. Standard
deviation is preferred because of the following advantages:
      1)    Standard Deviation considers every possible event and assigns each event a weight equal to its
            probability.
   2)       Standard deviation is a very familiar concept and many calculators and computers are programmed to
            calculate it.
   3)       Standard deviation is a measure of dispersion around the expected (or average) value. This is in
            absolute consensus with the definition of risk as “variability of returns”.
   4)       Standard deviation is obtained as the square root of the sum of squared differences multiplied by
            their probabilities. This facilitates comparison of risk as measured by standard deviation and expected
            returns as both are measured in the same costs. This is why standard deviation is preferred to variance
            as a measure of risk.
If two projects have the same cost and their net present value are also the same, standard deviations of the
expected cash inflows of the two projects may be calculated to judge the comparative risk of the projects. The
project having a higher standard deviation is said to be more risky as compared to the other.

  Standard Deviation = √∑ Pid2 = √2600000 = 1,612
  As the Standard Deviation of Project A is more than that of project B, A is more risky.

 5. Co-Efficient of Variation
Investment proposals involve substantially varied cash outlays and Standard Deviation is not a suitable
comparison criterion. To overcome such adverse situation, relative measure of dispersion or variability is used.
This relative measure of dispersion based on standard deviation is called Co-efficient of Standard Deviation or
Co-efficient of Variation.
Coefficient of variation is a relative measure of dispersion. If the projects have the same cost but different net
present values, relative measure, i.e., coefficient of variation should be computed to judge the relative position
of risk involved. It can be calculated as:

                                                                Standard Deviation (σ)
                    Certainty Equivalent Co-efficient =                                      x 100
                                                             Mean of expected Cash Flows

  On the basis of MVs above, it is observed that project B is marginally preferable to X, by Rs. 30,000.
  Project B is however is more risky, offering profit Rs. 16,00,000 but also loss to the extent Rs. 8,00,000.
  Let us compute standard deviation of each project as follows:

  Standard deviation = √4,70,400 = 685.857
  As the MV of the project differs, we have to find out coefficient of variation for each project, as follows:

  Here, Project A is, less risky and should be selected.

 6. Sensitivity Technique
Where cash inflows are very sensitive under different circumstances, more than one forecast of the future cash
inflows may be made. These inflows may be regarded as ‘Optimistic’, ‘Most Likely’ and ‘Pessimistic’. Further
cash inflows may be discounted to find out the net present values under these three different situations. If the
net present values under the three situations differ widely it implies that there is a great risk in the project and
the investor’s decision to accept or reject a project will depend upon his risk bearing abilities.

  Illustration 14:
  Mr. ABC, a risky investor is considering two mutually exclusive projects A and B. You are required to advise
  him about the acceptability of the project from the following information.

The net present values as calculated above indicate that Project B is more risky as compared to Project A. but at
the same time during favorable conditions, it is more profitable also. The acceptability of the project will depend
upon Mr. ABC’s attitude towards risk. If he could afford to take higher risk, project B may be more profitable.

 7. Decision Tree Technique
This technique is a graphical display of the relationship between a present decision and future events, future
decisions and their consequences. In modern business there are complex investment decisions which involve a
sequence of decisions over time. Such sequential decisions can be handled by plotting decisions trees.
A decision tree is a graphic representation of the relationship between a present decision and future events,
future decisions and their consequences. The sequence of events is mapped out over time in a format resembling
branches of a tree and hence the analysis is known as decision tree analysis.
The decision tree can be constructed with following five steps:
      l   First: Identification of the problem and defining the Proposal
      l   Second: Identifying maximum alternatives
      l   Third: Graphing the Decision Tree indicating the decision points, chance events, and other relevant
          data
      l   Fourth: Forecasting Cash Flow and specification of probabilities
      l   Fifth: Result Evaluation (Analysis of the alternatives)




                                                F-1.7 A Decision Tree
For example, a company ‘X’ has an opportunity to invest in equivalent schemes that will last for two years and
will cost r 1,00,000 initially. Cost of capital is 15%. It has the following estimated possible cash flow after tax
(CFAT)
Year
One: 30% chance that (CFAT) will be r 40,000/-40% chance that (CFAT) will be r 60,000/- 30%
chance that (CFAT) will be r 80,000

The above decision tree shows possible CFAT outcomes in each year and the probabilities associated with
these outcomes. The decision tree shows nine distinct paths, or combinations of outcomes that the project
would take if accepted. One possibility is that one year’s CFAT is Rs. 40,000 and the second year’s CFAT is

                                                                                                                     527

Rs. 20,000. This is worst combination of outcomes that could occur. The company X would have paid Rs.1,00,000
for a CFAT stream of Rs. 40,000 and Rs. 20,000 in years one and two respectively. If the company X determined
that an appropriate discountrate for this project is 15%, the NPV of the worst path is –Rs. 50,080. By looking at
the decision tree figure, the best path for the firm is CFAT1 = Rs. 80,000 and CFAT2 = Rs. 1,20,000. The NPV at
15% of that path is Rs. 60,320. The decision tree shows NPV of each of the nine possible CFAT paths in the tree
at discount rate of 15%. The expected net present value (NPV) of the problem depicted by the decision tree is
the weighted average of net present values of all the paths:
            N
NVP=    ∑ (Probj) (NPVj)
        J=0

Where NPVj = net present value of the jth path
Probj = the probability of the jth path occurring N = number of possible paths
The probability of a path occurring is called its joint probability. It is equal to the product of the probabilities
along with the path.
In the decision tree calculations the last column shows the calculation of expected NPV which is the weighted
average of individual path NPVs where the weights are the path probabilities. NPV for example is Rs. 10,411 and
project should be accepted.
For short period projects the above technique is good but for long period projects it becomes more complicated
with the multiplication of paths, for the number of possibilities. In the above case, there had been 9 paths for 2
years, but for the 3 years these could be (3 × 3 × 3) = 27 paths and likewise the increase of path complicates the
diagram and calculations.

                                                Evaluation of Projects
i) Pay-back Method:
       a.   Pay-back Period = Initial Investment / Annual Cash Inflows
		 Machine X = Rs. 15,000 / Rs. 5,250 = 2.86 years
		 Machine Y = Rs. 24,000 / Rs. 7,000 = 3.43 years
       b.   Post Pay-back Profitability = Annual Cash Inflows x (Whole life – Pay-back period)
		 Machine X = Rs. 5,250 x (5 – 2.86) = Rs. 11,235
		 Machine Y = Rs. 7,000 x (6 – 3.43) = Rs. 17,990
Decision: According to Pay-back period method, the machine X should be purchased, but if post pay-back
profitability method is used, then machine Y should be purchased.
ii) Unadjusted Return on Average Investment Method:
Average Rate of Return = Average Annual Net Savings / Average Investment x100
Machine X = Rs. 2,250 / Rs. 7,500 x 100 = 30%
Machine Y = Rs. 3,000 / Rs. 12,000 x 100 = 25%
Average Investment = Initial Investment / 2
Decision: According to this method machine X should be purchased.
iii) Net Present Value Index Method:
Present Value = Annual Cash Inflows x P.V. Factor at 8%
Machine X           =       Rs. 5,250 x 3.993        = Rs. 20,963
Machine Y           =       Rs. 7,000 x 4.623        = Rs. 32,361
Net Present Value Index = Present Value / Investment
Machine X           =       Rs. 20,963 / Rs.15, 000 = 1.3975
Machine Y           =       Rs. 32,361 / Rs.24, 000 = 1.3484

                                               LESSON ROUND-UP

      l   Capital Budgeting refers to long-term planning for proposed capital outlays and their financing.
          Capital Budgeting may also be defined as “the firms’ decision to invest its current fund more
          efficiently in long- term activities in anticipation of an expected flow of future benefit over a series of
          years.
      l   Capital Rationing helps the firm to select the combination of investment projects that will be within
          the specified limits of investments to be made during a given period of time and at the same time
          provide greatest profitability.
      l   Pay Back technique estimates the time required by the project to recover, through cash inflows, the
          firm’s initial outlay. Payback period = Initial Investment / Annual cash inflows
      l   Average Rate of Return method is designated to consider the relative profitability of different capital
          investment proposals as the basis for ranking them – the fact neglected by the payout period
          technique.
      l   Net Present Value: The cash outflows and inflows associated with each project are ascertained first
          and both are reduced to the present values at the rate of return acceptable to the management. The
          rate of return is either cost of capital of the firm or the opportunity cost of capital to be invested in
          the project.
      l   Internal Rate of Return: The internal rate of return refers to the rate which equates the present value
          of cash inflows and present value of cash outflows.
      l   Profitability Index (PI): Profitability Index is defined as the ratio of present value of the future cash
          benefits at the required rate of return to the initial cash outflow of the investment.


                                                    GLOSSARY

 Internal Rate of Return: The internal rate of return calculation is used to determine whether a particular
 investment is worthwhile by assessing the interest that should be yielded over the course of a capital
 investment.
 Net Present Value: Net present value (NPV) is used for the same purpose as the internal rate of return,
 analyzing the projected returns for a potential investment or project. The net present value represents the
 difference between the current value of money flowing into the project and the current value of money being
 spent. The value can be calculated as positive or negative, with a positive net present value implying that
 the earnings generated by a project or investment will exceed the expected costs of the venture and should
 be pursued.

Capital Budgeting                                                                                      LESSON 13

 Profitability Index: The profitability index is a capital budgeting tool designed to identify the relationship
 between the cost of a proposed investment and the benefits that could be produced if the venture was
 successful. The profitability index employs a ratio that consists of the present value of future cash flows over
 the initial investment. As this ratio increases beyond 1.0, the proposed investment becomes more desirable
 to companies. When this ratio does not exceed 1.0, the investment should be deferred, as the project’s
 present value is less than the initial investment.
 Accounting Rate of Return: The accounting rate of return is the projected return that an organization can
 expect from a proposed capital investment. To discover the accounting rate of return, finance professionals
 must divide the average profit by the initial investment. The accounting rate of return is a useful metric for
 quickly calculating the profitability of a company, and it is widely used for analysing the success rates of
 investments that feature multiple projects.
 Payback Period: The payback period is a unique capital budgeting method. Specifically, the payback period
 is a financial analytical tool that defines the length of time necessary to earn back money that has been
 invested. A subcategory, price-to-earnings growth payback period, is used to define the time required for a
 company’s earnings to find equivalence with the stock price paid by investors. The price-to-earnings growth
 payback period is also widely used to get a basic understanding of how risky an investment opportunity
 may be. Understanding the payback period of an investment limits the risks associated with taking on costly
 projects.
 Equivalent Annuity: The equivalent annuity method expresses the NPV as an annualized cash flow by
 dividing it by the present value of the annuity factor. It is often used when comparing investment projects of
 unequal lifespans. For example, if project A has an expected lifetime of seven years, and project B has an
 expected lifetime of 11 years, it would be improper to simply compare the net present values (NPVs) of the
 two projects, unless the projects could not be repeated.
 Real Options Analysis: The discounted cash flow methods essentially value projects as if they were risky
 bonds, with the promised cash flows known. But managers will have many choices of how to increase future
 cash inflows or to decrease future cash outflows. In other words, managers get to manage the projects,
 not simply accept or reject them. Real options analysis try to value the choices–the option value–that the
 managers will have in the future and adds these values to the NPV.

 INTRODUCTION
The cost of capital is the rate of return a firm must earn on its investments so that the market value of the firm
remains unchanged. Thus, it is a yardstick or basis of approval or rejection of an investment. In this way it
becomes a target rate of return, cut off rate or hurdle rate or the financial standard of assessment of performance
of a project.
Cost of capital is the required rate of return on its investments which belongs to equity, debt and retained
earnings. If a firm fails to earn return at the expected rate, the market value of the shares will fall and it will result
in the reduction of overall wealth of the shareholders.
The choice of financing makes the cost of capital a crucial variable for every company, as it will determine its
capital structure. Companies look for the optimal mix of financing that provides adequate funding and minimizes
the cost of capital.
   “The cost of capital is the minimum rate of return which a firm requires as a condition for undertaking an
   investment.”
                                                                                                     - Milton H. Spencer
   “Cost of capital is the minimum required rate of earnings or the cut off rate for capital expenditures.”
                                                                                                          -Solomon Ezra
   “A cut-off rate for the allocation of capital to investment of projects. It is the rate of return on a project that will
   leave unchanged the market price of the stock”.
                                                                                                  -James C. Van Horne
   “Cost of capital is the rate of return the firm required from investment in order to increase the value of the firm
   in the market place”

 IMPORTANCE OF THE CONCEPT OF COST OF CAPITAL
The importance of this concept to modern management is summarized as follows:
i) Designing the Optimal Capital Structure:
This concept is very helpful in designing a sound, optimal and economical capital structure of the firm. Each
source of capital involves different cost and different risk. By comparing various specific costs of different
sources, the financial manager can select the best and the most economical source of finance.
ii) Helpful in Evaluation of Expansion Projects:
It helps in the evaluation of financial soundness of a given expansion project. An expansion project will be
accepted by the management only when the marginal return on investment exceeds the cost of its financing.
iii) Rational Allocation of National Resources:
The concept of cost of capital is important for national economy as well since it provides the basis of optimum
allocation of financial resources.
iv) Evaluation of Financial Performance of Top Management:
The cost of capital framework can be used to evaluate the financial performance of top executives. Such an
evaluation can be done by comparing the actual profitability of the projects undertaken with the projected
overall cost of capital, and an appraisal of the actual costs incurred in raising the required funds.

v) Financing and Dividend Decisions:
This concept is useful in other areas of financial decision making, such as dividend decisions, decisions on
capitalization of profits and rights issue, working capital management and capital expenditure control etc.

 FACTORS DETERMINING THE FIRM’S COST OF CAPITAL
Cost of capital, like all other costs, is a variable term, subject to changes in a number of factors. The various
factors that play a part in determination of cost of capital are described below. There are four main factors
which mainly determine the cost of Capital of a firm.
1. General Economic Conditions
General economic conditions determine the demand for and supply of capital within the economy, as well
as the level of expected inflation. This economic variable is reflected in the risk less rate of return. This rate
represents the rate of return on risk- free investments, such as the interest rate on short-term government
securities. In principle, as the demand for money in the economy changes relative to the supply, investors alter
their required rate of return. For example, if the demand for money increases without an equivalent increase in
the supply, lenders will raise their required interest rate. At the same time, if inflation is expected to deteriorate
the purchasing power of money, investors require a higher rate of return to compensate for this anticipated loss.
2. Market Conditions
When an investor purchases a security with significant risk, an opportunity for additional returns is necessary to
make the investment attractive. Essentially, as risk increases, the investor requires a higher rate of return. This
increase is called a risk premium. When investors increase their required rate of return, the cost of capital rises
simultaneously. If the security is not readily marketable when the investor wants to sell, or even if a continuous
demand for the security exists but the price varies significantly, an investor will require a relatively high rate of
return. Conversely, if a security is readily marketable and its price is reasonably stable, the investor will require
a lower rate of return and the company’s cost of capital will be lower.
3. Operating and Financing Decisions
Risk, or the variability of returns, also results from decisions made within the company. Risk resulting from these
decisions is generally divided into two types: business risk and financial risk. Business risk is the variability
in returns on assets and is affected by the company’s investment decisions. Financial risk is the increased
variability in returns to common stockholders as a result of financing with debt or preferred stock. As business
risk and financial risk increase or decrease, the investor’s required rate of return (and the cost of capital) will
move in the same direction.
4. Amount of Financing
The last factor determining the corporation’s cost of funds is the level of financing that the firm requires. As the
financing requirements of the firm become larger, the weighted cost of capital increases for several reasons. For
instance, as more securities are issued, additional flotation costs, or the cost incurred by the firm from issuing
securities, will affect the percentage cost of the funds to the firm. Also, as management approaches the market
for large amounts of capital relative to the firm’s size, the investors’ required rate of return may rise. Suppliers of
capital become hesitant to grant relatively large sums without evidence of management’s capability to absorb
this capital into the business. This is typically “too much too soon”. Also, as the size of the issue increases, there
is greater difficulty in placing it in the market without reducing the price of the security, which also increases the
firm’s cost of capital.

 MEASUREMENT OF COST OF CAPITAL OR COMPONENTS OF COST OF CAPITAL
A company receives capital from different sources and cost of each source differs from each other because cost
of issue of raising capital from different sources, interest payable (or dividend payable) and degree of corporate
tax burden differ. Hence, in order to find out cost of capital of a company, the first step is the calculation of the
cost of individual sources of funds (i.e., specific costs) and thereafter weighted average cost of proceeds from
different sources of capital is ascertained. This is known as company’s cost of capital.

 Assumption of Cost of Capital
While computing the cost of capital, the following assumptions are made:
      1.   The financial and business risks are not affected by investing in new investment in new investment
           proposals.
   2.      The firm’s capital structure remains unchanged.
   3.      Cost of each source of capital is determined on an after tax basis.
   4.      Cost of previously obtained capital is not relevant for computing the cost of capital to be raised from a
           specific source.
A company has a capital structure with the different components. Each component carries its own importance
as well as burden over the firm. This burden is in term of the cost charged over the firm to carry such component;
therefore it is required to calculate their cost on individual basis. These are as follows:




 1. COST OF DEBT CAPITAL:
Generally, debt may be in form of term loans, bonds and debentures from financial institutions and banks. The
debts always carry a fixed rate of interest as a charge for the users which a firm is ready to pay to maximize its
profitability and wealth. This rate of interest is called as cost of capital.

                The cost of Capital is the amount or a rate of interest which is paid to hire a debt.

The rate adjoined with the debt as generally shown (as 10% Debenture) is the rate of interest to be paid over
the Debenture/debt but the actual cost may differ from this rate. To find the actual charge (real cost of debt), it
is required to know the relation of interest over the actual amount realized (Net Proceed).

The Net Proceed is that amount which is actually realized after adjusting discount or premium on the face value
of loan or debentures after charging floatation costs.
The Net Proceeds will be calculated as follows:




The floatation costs include all types of charges or expenses which incurred to obtain such loan.
The floatation costs include the following expenditures:
    l    Advertisements Charges
    l    Postage
    l    Stationery & Printing
    l    Stamp duty
    l    Brokerage
    l    Underwriting commission etc.
Debt-capital is of two types:
   A)    Perpetual or Irredeemable Debt
   B)    Redeemable Debt

A) Perpetual or Irredeemable Debt:
These are the debts which are repayable only on the liquidation of the company. For calculating cost of this
type of debt-capital, amount of interest payable on it is divided by the net proceeds from its issue.
The formula is:

                                                           i
                                           Cd (or Kd) =         x 100
                                                           NP
			                      where i          = Amount of Annual Interest
				NP                                    = Net Proceeds
B) Redeemable Debt:
Mostly debentures are repayable within a stipulated time period. In the calculation of cost of such debts, time
period of their redemption is very important.
The formula for calculating the cost of debenture-capital can be adapted as follows:




                                                                                                           549
EP-CA&FM                                                                                                        Cost of Capital


                                                                   MV-NP
                                                                    i+
                                                             Cd =    n x100
                                                                  MV+NP
                                                                    2

		where, Cd                              = cost of debt capital
				                                     i = annual interest payment
				MV = maturity value
				NP = net proceeds
				                                     n = number of years to maturity
For calculating after tax cost of debt capital, the amount of interest is to be adjusted as follows:
   a)   In case of irredeemable debts:

                           i (1 – t)
        Cd (after tax) =               x 100
                             NP
		or Cd (after tax) = Before tax cost (1 – t)
   b)   In case of redeemable debts:

                                            MV-NP
                                       i(1-t)+
                              Cd =            n x100
        Cd (after tax) =
                                          MV+NP
                                            2

                             Cd (before tax) =                      x 100 =              x 100 = 15.05%

 2. COST OF PREFERENCE SHARE CAPITAL:
Preference shares are also fixed cost bearing securities like debentures. The rate of dividend payable on these
shares is fixed well in advance at the time of their issue. Since dividend is not an admissible deduction in the
computation of taxable income, unlike debentures, cost of preference share capital is ‘after tax cost’ of capital
which may be converted into before tax cost by applying the following formula:

                                                                     After tax cost
                                                Cd (before tax) =
                                                                      1 – tax rate
The preference shares may be
      (i)   Irredeemable or
   (ii)     Redeemable.
Cost of Irredeemable Preference Share Capital:
Cost of such preference shares is the ratio of annual dividend burden on each such share to its net proceeds.
As per formula:

                                                                    PD

 3. COST OF EQUITY SHARE CAPITAL:
The calculation of cost of equity share capital is relatively difficult task because like preference share capital
there is neither any prefixed rate of dividend payable on these shares nor there is any legal obligation to pay
dividend on them. But it does not mean that equity share capital is cost-free. The cost of such capital is equal
to that expectation of equity shareholders, which they expect to be fulfilled by the management to maintain of
their company.
Following are the four approaches of estimating the cost equity share capital:
1) CAPM model
This is a popular approach to estimate the cost of equity. According to the CAPM, the cost of equity capital is:
Ke = Rf + (Rm - Rf ) ß
Where:
Ke = Cost of equity
Rf = Risk-free rate
Rm = Equity market required return (expected return on the market portfolio)
ß = beta is Systematic Risk Coefficient.
Beta is the measure of market risk. Market risk is the risk that cannot be diversified away.

   Illustration-7:
   Calculate the cost of equity capital for a company whose Risk-free rate =10%, equity market required
   return =18% with a beta of 0.5.
   Solution
   Ke = 0.10 + 0.5(0.18 - 0.10)
   = 0.14 or 14%.

2) Dividend Yield Method:
This is also called as Dividend/Price Ratio Method or D/P Ratio Method. This Method is based on the thinking
that when an investor invests his savings in a company, he expects dividend at least at current rate of return.

Cost of Capital                                                                                        LESSON 14

As such cost of equity capital is calculated on the basis of the future steam of dividends which the shareholders
expect to receive from a company. The formula is

                                                                    DPS
                                                Ce (after tax) =           x 100
                                                                    MP
Where, = Cost of Equity Share Capital
DPS = Current Cash Dividend per Share
MP = Market Price per Share.

   Illustration-8:
   SK Ltd. has issued 20,000 equity shares of Rs. 100 each as fully paid. The present market price of these
   shares of Rs. 160 per share. The company has paid a dividend of Rs. 8 per share. Find out the cost of equity
   capital.
   Solution:

                                                DPS                  8
                                         Ce =            x 100              x 100 = 5%

3) Earnings Yield Method:
This is also known as Earnings/Price Ratio Method or E/P Ratio Method. This method is based on the assumption
that market price of the shares is based on earning per share and so shareholders capitalize the expected
future earnings (as distinguished from dividends) in order to evaluate their shareholders. Hence, cost of equity
capital is found by relating earnings per share with its market price.
The formula is as follows:

                                                                    EPS
                                                Ce (after tax) =           x 100
                                                                    MP
   Where,         Ce= Cost of Equity Share Capital
   		             EPS = Earnings Per Share
		                MP = Market Price Per Share.

   Illustration-9:
   SK Ltd. has issued 1,000 equity shares of Rs. 100 each as fully paid. It has earned a profit of Rs. 10,000
   after tax. The market price of these shares is Rs. 160 per share. Find out the cost of equity capital before
   and after tax assuming a tax rate of 50%.
   Solution:

                                          EPS                  Rs. 10,000/1,000
                      Ce (after tax) =           x 100                                x 100 = 6.25%

4) Dividend Yield + Growth in Dividend Method:
This method is also known as Dividend/Price + Growth in Dividend Method or D/P + G Method. This method is
based on the thinking that each equity shareholder is not satisfied with the present rate of dividend only, he
wants an increased in it each year based on his expectations of increase in future earnings of the company. In
this method, cost of equity share capital is found by making appropriate adjustment in current rate of dividend
on the basis of probable rate of increase in future earnings of the company. This rate of increase is termed as
growth rate.
i) When dividends are expected to grow at a uniform rate perpetually:
in this case, the yearly growth rate in dividend is added to the cost of equity capital as ascertained in accordance
with D/P ratio method. The formula is:

                                                        DPS           
                                     Ce (After tax)=             x 100 +G
                                                      MP (or NP)      

Where, Ce = Cost of Equity Share Capital
DPS = Expected Dividend Per Share
MP = Current Market Price Per Share
NP = Net Proceeds per share
G = Growth Rate in expected Dividend (or expected annual percentage rate of increase in future dividends)

  Illustration-10:
  The average rate of dividend paid by SK Ltd. for the last five years is 21 per cent. The earnings of the
  company have recorded a growth rate of 3 per cent per annum. The market value of the equity shares is
  estimated to be Rs. 105. Find out (a) the cost of equity share capital. (b) Determine the estimated market
  price of the equity shares if the anticipated growth rate of the firm rises to 5%. (c) If the company’s cost of
  capital is 20% and anticipated growth rate is 5%, determine the market price of the share, assuming the
  same dividend per share.

   (c) Determination of market price if cost of capital is 20%:
                                                   DPS                  21      

                                                    = 20 – 5 = 2,100 / MP
                                         MP = 2,100 15 = Rs. 140 per share
ii) When dividends grow at different rates
In such a case, the constant growth equation mentioned above is to be modified to take into account two or
more growth rates. For example: if dividends are expected to grow at a super normal growth rate, for any years
and thereafter, at a normal perpetual growth rate, beginning in the year n + 1, then the cost of equity share will
be determined by applying the following formula:

                                                       DPS       

                                               D0 (1 + gn )t −1                  Dn (1 + gn )t −1
                                  MP=   ∑ (1 + K )
                                        t= 1             e
                                                             t
                                                                  +    ∑
                                                                      t = n +1
                                                                                   (1 + K e )t

Where, gn= rate of growth in earlier years.
gc= constant growth in late years
Instead of applying the above formula, the problem can be solved with the help of present value table as under.

   Illustration-11:
   The SK Company declared last dividend of Rs. 1.50 last year. The company is likely to have growth rate
   of 12% in the next two years, 10% in the third year and fourth year and thereafter the growth rate would
   stabilize at 8%. Find the price at which the share shall be purchased if the shareholders expected rate of
   return is 16%.
   Solution:
   In this case, we need to determine the intrinsic value of the shares which will be equal to the present value
   of the next four dividends + present value of the market price of the share in the fourth year.

                                                 16% – 8%
  Therefore, price at the end of the fourth year = Rs. 30.62
  Present value of the market price at the end of fourth year = 30.62 x 0.552 = 16.90
  Total Intrinsic Value = Rs. 5.40 + Rs. 16 .90 = Rs. 22.30
  The share shall not be bought for rupees more than 22.30.
COST OF NEWLY ISSUED EQUITY SHARES:
Cost of newly issued equity shares will be higher than the old shares because the company will have to pay
flotation charges on new issue of shares which reduces the net proceeds of the issue. In such a case, for
calculating the cost of such newly issued shares, earning per share (or dividend per share) will be divided by the
net proceeds per share (and not market price per share). Rest is the same as for existing equity share capital. If
cost if equity capital is being estimated by E/P ratio method, the formula will be adjusted as follows:
                                                 EPS          DPS        DPS      

Where, EPS = Earnings per Share; NP = Net Proceeds

  Face value of share                            = Rs. 100
  Market value                                   = Rs 105
  Securities premium                             = Rs. 3 per share
  After-tax net earnings                         = Rs. 10.50 per share
  Cost of issue                                  = Rs. 3 per share
  Tax Rate                                       = 50%

 4. COST OF RETAINED EARNINGS:
That part of earnings of a company which remains with it after distribution on dividend among the shareholders
is called as ‘retained earnings’. They are commonly known as internal equity of the concern. There is no explicit
cost of this type of profits because there is no formal or implied obligation on the company to pay any return on
this amount. But it is not correct to treat them as cost free. In fact, cost of this source of finance is its opportunity
cost. If retained earnings were not retained, they would have been paid out to the shareholders as dividend and

the shareholders should have invested it in some alternative investments and should have earned return. When
earnings are retained, the shareholders are forced to forego such return. Hence, the expected return foregone
by the shareholders on forgone dividends may be treated as the cost of retained earnings. The following
formula will be applied for calculating cost of retained earnings:

                                                              DPS (1 – Ti) (1 – B)

                                                            (DPS + G) (1 – Ti) (1 – B)
                                           Cr (or Kr) =                                  x 100
                                                                   MP (1 – Te)
Where, Cr= Cost of Retained Earnings
         DPS = Dividend Per Share
         Ti = Marginal tax rate applicable to individual shareholder
         B = Brokerage Cost
         MP = Present Market Price per share
         Te = Capital Gains Tax
         G = Growth rate of dividends
Notes: Cost of retained earnings calculated by the above formula is after tax cost. It can, however, be converted
into before tax cost by applying the following formula:

                                                                         After tax cost

 OVERALL COST OF CAPITAL
A company finances its projects by different sources, although the specific cost of each source of finance is
different. Some are cheaper and some are dearer. There are two objectives of this policy – firstly, to balance the
capital structure, and secondly to increase the return of equity shareholders. These objectives can be achieved
only when firm’s average cost of financing is lower than its return on investment. This requires the computation
of overall or average cost of capital. Overall cost of capital may be defined as the average cost of the specific
costs of different sources of financing. This is used as acceptance/ rejection criterion in capital expenditure
decisions.
The average can be a simple average or weighted average. However, weighted average is more reasonable
and appropriate as it gives due emphasis to different sources of capital in the capital structure of a firm.
Computation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital
It involves the following four steps:
      1)   The computation of specific costs of various sources. It has already been explained in the preceding
           pages in this chapter.
   2)      Assignment of weights to each type of funds.
   3)      Each specific cost is multiplied by the corresponding weight and in this way weighted cost of each
           source is determined.
   4)      Finally, weighted cost of all sources of capital as calculated in (3) are added together to get an overall
           weighted average cost of capital.
Assignment of Weights
This involves the determination of share of each source of capital in the total capital structure of the company.
There are three approaches of assigning weights:
i) Historical Weights Approach:
According to this approach, the relative proportions of various sources of capital to the existing capital structure
are used to assign weights. The assumption of this approach is that the company’s present capital structure is
optimum and it will raise additional funds from various sources in proportion to their share in the existing capital
structure.
Historical weights can be given on the basis of face or book value of securities or on the basis of their market
value.
a) Book Value Weights:
This is most convenient to be used. In this method proportion of each source in total capital structure is
determined on the basis of the book value of securities.

   Thus, weighted average cost of capital is 11.10% while simple average of cost of capital = 46% / 4 = 11.50%.
b) Market Value Weights:
In this method, market value of invested capital funds of each type of security is calculated on the basis of their
prevailing market values and proportion of each type of security to the total of market values of all securities is
used as weight. This is theoretically more sound and appealing approach since market values of the securities
closely approximate the actual rupees to be received from their sale. However, it is more difficult to calculate
the market values of a firm’s sources of equity financing (i.e., preference shares, equity shares and retained
earning) than to use book values.


   Illustration-15
   In illustration no.14, assume market value of preference shares at 150% equity shares and retained earnings
   at 160% and debentures at par, calculate average cost of capital.
   Solution:

      Source of Capital        Market Value           Market Value Weights               Specific    Weighted
                                                                                           Costs        Costs

Thus, weighted average cost of capital is 12%.
ii) Target Weights Approach:
If a firm has determined the capital structure which it believes most consistent with its goal of owner’s wealth
maximization and it is directing its financing policies toward achievement of this “optimal” capital structure, then
the use of these target capital structure weights may be appropriate.


  Illustration-16
  If illustration no.14, the firm believed that its optimal capital structure is consisting of 40% debt, 10%
  preference shares, 35% equity shares and 15% retained earnings, calculate weighted average cost of
  capital using target weights.

iii) Marginal Weights Approach:
According to this approach, specific costs are assigned weights in proportion of funds to be raised from each
source to the total funds to be raised. This approach presumes that new project is to be financed wholly by
raising fresh capital.


  Illustration-17:
  A company’s cost of capital for specific sources is as under:
  Cost of Debentures			                   5%
  Cost of Preference Shares		             10%
  Cost of Equity Shares			                14%
  Cost of Retained Earnings		             13%
  The company wishes to raise Rs. 5,00,000 for the expansion of its plant. It is estimated that Rs. 1,00,000
  will be available as retained earnings and the balance of the additional funds will be raised as under:
  Debenture issue 			                     Rs. 3,00,000
  Preference share issue		                Rs. 1,00,000
  Using marginal weights, calculate weighted average cost of capital.

          The market price of equity shares is Rs. 160.
  It is expected that the company will pay a current dividend of Rs. 20 share which will grow at 7.5% for ever.
  The tax rate may be assumed to be 50%. You are required to calculate:
  a)      Weighted average cost of capital based on existing capital structure.
  b)      The new weighted cost of capital if the company raises an additional Rs. 10,00,000 debt by issuing
          14% Debentures. This would result sin increasing the dividend rate to Rs. 25 per share and leave the
          growth rate unchanged but the price of share will fall to Rs. 150 per share.
   c)     The weighted cost of capital if in (b) above, the growth rate rises to 10%.

 Marginal Cost of Capital (MCC)
MCC can be defined as the cost of additional capital introduced in the capital structure since we have assumed
that the capital structure can vary according to changing requirements of the firm.
The following illustration shows how marginal cost of capital can be calculated:
Let us assume that the capital structure of the firm has been expanded by addition to various components. The
addition has been Rs. 2,000 lacs for debt, Rs. 1,000 lacs for preference capital, Rs. 2,000 lacs for equity capital
and Rs. 6,000 lacs for retained earnings. The cost of each component of the capital structure after addition
would be the weighted average of the old and new values of the component:
                                                                                                        (Rs. in lakhs)

         Component            Existing           Cost (%)    Additional         Cost (%)        Weighted average
                               Value                           Value                                Cost (%)
            Debt               4,000               14          2,000               16                  14.6
      Preference Capital        1,000               9          1,000               12                  10.5
        Equity Capital          1,000              15          2,000              20                   18.34
      Retained Earnings        4,000               18          6,000               18                  18.00

Having calculated the weighted cost of each component, we calculate the weighted average cost of the entire
capital structure now:

         Component                   Weight (%)                  Cost (%)                    Weighted cost
            Debt                         28.57                          14.6                14.6 x 0.29 = 4.23
      Preference capital                  9.52                      10.5                   10.5 x 0.0952 = 1.00
        Equity capital                   14.28                     18.34                  18.34 x 0.1428 = 2.62
      Retained earnings                  47.62                          18                 18 x 0.4762 = 8.57
            Total            WACC = 4.23 + 1.00 + 2.62
                                  + 8.57 = 16.42 %

Marginal cost of addition is 16.42 – 15.2 = 1.22%. The return on investment has to be more than the revised
weighted average cost of capital in order to ensure that the investors stay invested.

 CASE STUDIES
Question 1 - The capital structure of a firm consists of equity of Rs. 80 lakhs; 10% preference shares 20lakhs and
14% debentures of Rs. 60 lakhs. At present its equity share is selling for Rs. 25. It is expected that the company
will pay a dividend of Rs. 2. It has been growing @ 7% p.a. If the company is subject to 50% tax rate, determine
its weighted average cost of capital.

		Kr (after tax) = E(1 – tp) / MP x 100 = 10 x (1 - .10) / 100 x 100 = 9%
   iii)   Cost of Preference share Capital
		Kp (after tax) = DPS / NP x 100 = 6/100 x 100 = 6%
   iv)    Cost of Debentures

Find out the weighted average cost of capital.
Solution: -
      i)    Cost of Equity Capital
		 Ke (after tax) = EPS / MP x 100 = 15/125 x 100 = 12%
		 MP = (Rs. 4, 00,000 + Rx. 1, 00,000) / 4,000 = Rs. 125
      ii)   Cost of Debentures (first issue)
		 Kd (after tax)             =        R/NP x 100(1-t)
			                           =        6 / 100 x 100(1 - .50)
			                           =        6 x .50 = 3%
   iii)     Cost of Debentures (second issue)
		 Kd (after tax) = R / NP x 100( 1 – t )
		          = 7/100 x 100(1 - .50) = 6 x .50 = 3.5%
   iv)      Cost of Preference Share Capital
		 Kp (after tax) = DPS/NP x 100
            = 8/100 x 100 = 8%

                                              LESSON ROUND-UP

   l The cost of capital is a term used in the field of financial investment to refer to the cost of a company’s
       funds (both debt and equity), or, from an investor’s point of view “the shareholder’s required return on
       a portfolio company’s existing securities”
   l Cost of capital is used to evaluate new projects of a company and it is the minimum return that investors
       expect for providing capital to the company.
   l For an investment to be worthwhile, the expected return on capital must be greater than the cost of
       capital. The cost of capital is the rate of return that capital could be expected to earn in an alternative
       investment of equivalent risk.
   l There are four main factors which mainly determine the cost of Capital of a firm. General economic
       conditions, the marketability of the firm’s securities (market conditions), operating and financing
       conditions within the company, and the amount of financing needed for new investments.
   l There are factors affecting cost of capital that the company has control over and includes Capital
       Structure Policy, Dividend Policy, Investment Policy etc.
   l There are some factors affecting cost of capital that these factors includes Level of Interest Rates, Tax
       Rates etc.
   l The weighted average cost of capital (WACC), as the name implies, is the weighted average of the costs
       of different components of the capital structure of a firm. WACC is calculated after assigning different
       weights to the components according to the proportion of that component in the capital structure.
   l Marginal Cost of Capital (MCC) can be defined as the cost of additional capital introduced in the capital

Cost of Capital                                                                                          LESSON 14

                                                   GLOSSARY

 Component Cost and Composite Cost: Component cost refers to the cost of individual components of
 capital viz., equity shares, preference shares, debentures and so on. Composite cost of capital refers to the
 combined or weighted average cost of capital of the various individual components. For capital budgeting
 decisions, it is the composite cost of capital which is considered.
 Average Cost and Marginal Cost: The average cost refers to the weighted average cost of capital. Marginal
 cost refers to the incremental cost attached with new funds raised by the company.
 Explicit Cost and Implicit Cost: Explicit cost is the one which is attached with the source of capital explicit or
 apparently. Implicit cost is the hidden cost which is not incurred directly. E.g. In case of the debt capital, the
 interest which the company is required to pay on the same is explicit cost of capital.
 Risk-free Interest Rate: The risk free interest rate is the interest rate on the risk free and default-free
 securities. For example, the securities issued by the Government of India are taken as risk free and default
 free in respect of payment of periodic interest as well as principal repayment on maturity.
 Real Interest Rate: The real interest rate is the interest rate payable to the lender for supplying the funds or
 in other words, for surrendering the funds for a particular period.
 Business Risk: Another factor affecting the cost of capital is the risk associated with the firm’s promise to
 pay interest and dividends to its investors. The business risk is related to the response of the firm’s Earnings
 before Interest and Taxes, EBIT, to change in sales revenue. Every project has its effect on the business
 risk of the firm. If a firm accepts a proposal which is more risky than average present risk, the investor will
 probably raise the cost of funds so as to be compensated for the increased risk.
 Financial Risk: The financial risk is an other type of risk which can affect the cost of capital of the firm. The
 particular composition and mixing of different sources of finance, known as the financial plan or the capital
 structure, can affect the return available to the investors. The financial risk is often defined as the likelihood
 that the firm would not be able to meet its fixed financial charges. It is related to the response of the firm’s
 earning per share to a variation in EBIT.

 INTRODUCTION, DEFINITION AND SIGNIFICANCE OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE

 Introduction
Given the Capital Budgeting decision of a firm, it has to decide the way in which the capital projects will be
financed. Every time the firm makes an Investment decision, it has to undertake a financing decision also. For
example, a decision to purchase a new machinery or plant implies specific ways of financing that project.
Should the firm employ equity or debt or both? What may be its implications/ What is the appropriate mix of debt
and equity? These are some questions that a firm needs to answer before taking up any Financing decision.
Capital structure means the structure or constitution or break-up of the capital employed by a firm. The capital
employed consists of both the owners’ capital and the debt capital provided by the lenders. Debt capital is
understood here to mean the long term debt which has been deployed to build long term assets. Apart from
the elements of equity and debt in the capital structure, a firm could have quasi equity in the form of convertible
debt.
The Financing or Capital Structure decision is a significant managerial decision as it influences the shareholder’s
return and risk. Consequently, the market value of the share may be affected by the capital structure decision.

 Definition of Capital Structure
The following definitions clearly initiate, the meaning and objective of the capital structure.
According to the definitions of Gerstenberg, “Capital Structure of a company refers to the composition or make
up of its capitalization and it includes all long-term capital resources”.
According to the definition of James C. Van Horne, Captial Structure is “The mix of a firm’s permanent long- term
financing represented by debt, preferred stock and common stock equity”.

 Type of Capital Structure
Capital Structure of a firm is a reflection of the overall investment and financing strategy of the firm. It shows
how much reliance is being placed by the firm on external sources of finance and how much internal accruals
are being used to finance expansions etc. Capital structure can be of various kinds as described below:
      1.   Horizontal Capital Structure
		 In a Horizontal capital structure, the firm has zero debt components in the structure mix. The structure is
   quite stable. Expansion of the firm takes in a lateral manner, i.e. through equity or retained earning only.
   The absence of debt results in the lack of financial leverage. Probability of disturbance of the structure
   is remote.
   2.      Vertical Capital Structure
		 In a vertical capital structure, the base of the structure is formed by a small amount of equity share
   capital. This base serves as the foundation on which the super structure of preference share capital
   and debt is built. The incremental addition in the capital structure is almost entirely in the form of debt.
   Quantum of retained earnings is low and the dividend pay-out ratio is quite high. In such a structure, the
   cost of equity capital is usually higher than the cost of debt. The high component of debt in the capital
   structure increases the financial risk of the firm and renders the structure unstable. The firm, because of
   the relatively lesser component of equity capital, is vulnerable to hostile takeovers.
   3.      Pyramid shaped Capital structure
		 A pyramid shaped capital structure has a large proportion consisting of equity capital and retained

         earnings which have been ploughed back into the firm over a considerably large period of time. The
         cost of share capital and the retained earnings of the firm is usually lower than the cost of debt. This
         structure is indicative of risk averse conservative firms.
   4.    Inverted Pyramid shaped Capital Structure
		 Such a capital structure has a small component of equity capital, reasonable level of retained earnings
   but an ever increasing component of debt. All the increases in the capital structure in the recent past
   have been made through debt only. This may be due to shrinking of retained earnings on account of
   accumulating losses. Such a capital structure is highly vulnerable to collapse.

 Significance of Capital Structure
Capital structure is significant for a firm because the long term profitability and solvency of the firm is sustained
by an optimal capital structure consisting of an appropriate mix of debt and equity. The capital structure also
is significant for the overall ranking of the firm in the industry group. The significance of the capital structure is
discussed below:
    1.   It reflects the firm’s strategy
		 The capital structure reflects the overall strategy of the firm. The strategy includes the pace of growth
   of the firm. In case the firm wants to grow at a faster pace, it would be required to incorporate debt in
   its capital structure to a greater extent. Further, in case of growth through acquisitions or the inorganic
   mode of growth as it is called, the firm would find that financial leverage is an important tool in funding
   the acquisitions.
   2.    It is an indicator of the risk profile of the firm
		 One can get a reasonably accurate broad idea about the risk profile of the firm from its capital structure.
   If the debt component in the capital structure is predominant, the fixed interest cost of the firm increases
   thereby increasing its risk. If the firm has no long term debt in its capital structure, it means that either it
   is risk averse or it has cost of equity capital or cost of retained earnings less than the cost of debt.
   3.    It acts as a tax management tool
		 The capital structure acts as a tax management tool also. Since the interest on borrowings is tax
   deductible, a firm having healthy growth in operating profits would find it worthwhile to incorporate
   debt in the capital structure in a greater measure.
   4.    It helps to brighten the image of the firm
		 A firm can build on the retained earnings component of the capital structure by issuing equity capital
   at a premium to a spread out base of small investors. Such an act has two benefits. On the one hand, it
   helps the firm to improve its image in the eyes of the investors. At the same time, it reduces chances of
   hostile take-over of the firm.

 CAPITAL STRUCTURE VIS-A-VIS FINANCIAL STRUCTURE
In engineering, structure refers to different parts of a building and thus in financial terms, financial structure
refers to all the components of finance in an organization. In simple terms, financial structure consists of all
assets, all liabilities and the capital. The manner in which an organization’s assets are financed is referred to
as its financial structure. There are some similarities between capital structure and financial structure. However,
there are many differences also.
If you take a look at the balance sheet of a company, the entire left hand side which includes liabilities plus

                                                                                                                 579

equity is called the financial structure of the company. It contains all the long term and short term sources of
capital. On the other hand, capital structure is the sum total of all long term sources of capital and thus is a part
of the financial structure. It includes debentures, long term debt, preference share capital, equity share capital
and retained earnings. In the simplest of terms, capital structure of a company is that part of financial structure
that reflects long term sources of capital.

In the above illustration, the total liabilities size of ` 4,60,000 is the financial structure of the firm while the long
term block of ` 2,72,000 is the capital structure. We can also say that that the total financial structure minus
the current liabilities structure gives us the capital structure. (Financial Structure - Current Liabilities = Capital
Structure)
We can enunciate the following differences between financial structure and capital structure:
      –     Capital structure relates to long term capital deployment for creation of long term assets. Financial
            structure involves creation of both long term and short term assets.

    –    Capital structure is the core element of the financial structure. Capital structure can exist without the
         current liabilities and in such cases. Capital structure shall be equal to the financial structure. But we
         cannot have a situation where the firm has only current liabilities and no long term capital.
    –    Components of the capital structure may be used to build up the level of current assets but the current
         liabilities should not be used to finance acquisition of fixed assets. This would result in an asset liability
         mismatch.

 PLANNING AND DESIGNING OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Just as planning and design of a physical structure is important, the same holds true for capital structure as
well. A well thought out plan for the capital structure supplemented by a careful design ensures that prime goal
of the firm, i.e. maximisation of the shareholder wealth is easily achieved.
Planning of the capital structure is a preliminary activity and it might commence as early at the time of incorporation
of the firm. Once the firm is established, the next logical step is to move in the direction of implementation of the
project. For meeting the cost of the project, the means of finance are to be arranged. Hence the need for timely
and early planning of the capital structure.
The management of a company should seek answers to the following questions while making the decision
regarding capital structure of the company:
        How should the investment project be financed?
        Does the way in which the investment projects are financed matter?
        How does financing affect the shareholders’ risk, return and value?
        Does there exist an optimum financing mix in terms of the maximum value to the firm’s shareholders?
        Can the optimum financing mix be determined in practice for a company?
        What factors in practice should a company consider in designing its financing policy?

 Attributes of a Well Planned Capital Structure
A sound or appropriate capital structure should have the following features:
Return: The capital structure of the company should be most advantageous. Subject to other considerations, it
should generate maximum returns to the shareholders without adding additional cost to them.
Risk: The use of excessive debt threatens the solvency of the company. To the point debt does not add significant
risk. It should be sued, otherwise its use should be avoided.
Flexibility: The capital structure should be flexible. It should be possible for a company to adapt its capital
structure with a minimum cost and delay if warranted by a changed situation. It should also be possible for the
company to provide funds whenever needed to finance its profitable activities.
Capacity: The capital structure should be determined within the debt capacity of the company and this capacity
should not be exceeded. The debt capacity of a company depends on its ability to generate future cash flows.
It should have enough cash to pay creditors’ fixed charges and principal sum.
Control: The capital structure should involve minimum risk of loss of control of the company. The owners of
closely-held companies are particularly concerned about dilution of control.

 Designing a Capital Structure
After planning the capital structure, we are faced with the issue of its design. Design takes off from where the

                                                                                                                  581
EP-CA&FM                                                                                            Capital Structure

plan ends. Planning establishes the broad parameters of the structure. It is left for the design to fill in the minor
details. While designing a capital structure, following points need to be kept in view:
      1.   Design should be functional: The design should create synergy with the long term strategy of the
           firm and should not be dysfunctional. It should facilitate the day to day working of the firm rather than
           create systematic bottlenecks.
   2.      Design should be flexible: The capital structure should be designed to incorporate a reasonable
           amount of flexibility in order to allow for temporary expansion or contraction of the share of each
           component.
   3.      Design should be conforming statutory guidelines: The design should conform to the statutory
           guidelines, if any, regarding the proportion and amount of each component. The limits imposed by
           lenders regarding the minimum level of owners’ equity required in the firm should be complied with.

 OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Is there an optimal capital structure for a firm? By the term optimal capital structure we mean a particular
arrangement of various components of the structure which is just in tune with the both the long term and short
term objectives of the firm. An optimal capital structure is the best debt to equity ratio for a firm that maximises
its value. The optimal capital structure for a company is one that offers a balance between the ideal debt to
equity range and minimises the firm’s cost of capital. A combination less or more than the optimal combination
would be less than satisfying. Hence, a sub-optimal combination would affect the achievement of the goal of
maximisation of the shareholders’ wealth.
But can we plan and design an optimal capital structure? For designing such a structure, one would need the
following information:
      –    The requirement of capital of the firm
      –    Availability of different components
      –    Cost of these components
      –    Rate of return from investment
It has to be further kept in mind that the above information should be exact information. In reality it is not
possible to have the exact information on all the above four parameters. Secondly whatever information is
available is for a particular period. Thus, we have to design the structure in a static set-up which makes the
design devoid of all flexibility.
The real world of business, however, is a dynamic world with ever changing demand and supply of various
components of the capital structure. Hence, we can not formulate the optimal capital structure in a static
framework. The process has to be carried out in a dynamic framework of interdependent investment and
financing decisions that yield optimal values within the constraints at the time and place when the decisions
were made. We can, therefore, say that the optimal capital structure is an ideal situation which can function as
the benchmark of performance for a firm. But this benchmark is invincible and the firm can expect to achieve
moderated or toned down versions of this benchmark depending upon dynamics of each project.

 FACTORS INFLUENCING CAPITAL STRUCTURE
Under the capital structure, decision regarding the proportion of long-term sources of capital is determined.
Most favourable proportion determines the optimum capital structure. That happens to be the need of the
company because EPS happens to be the maximum on it. Some of the chief factors affecting the choice of the
capital structure are the following:

582
Capital Structure                                                                                   LESSON 15

   (1)   Cash Flow Position
		 While making a choice of the capital structure the future cash flow position should be kept in mind. Debt
   capital should be used only if the cash flow position is really good because a lot of cash is needed in
   order to make payment of interest and refund of capital.
   (2)   Interest Coverage Ratio-ICR
		 With the help of this ratio an effort is made to find out how many times the EBIT is available to the
   payment of interest. The capacity of the company to use debt capital will be in direct proportion to this
   ratio.
		It is possible that inspite of better ICR the cash flow position of the company may be weak. Therefore,
  this ratio is not a proper or appropriate measure of the capacity of the company to pay interest. It is
  equally important to take into consideration the cash flow position.
   (3)   Debt Service Coverage Ratio-DSCR
		 This ratio removes the weakness of ICR. This shows the cash flow position of the company.
		 This ratio tells us about the cash payments to be made (e.g., preference dividend, interest and debt
   capital repayment) and the amount of cash available. Better ratio means the better capacity of the
   company for debt payment. Consequently, more debt can be utilised in the capital structure.
   (4)   Return on Investment-ROI
		 The greater return on investment of a company increases its capacity to utilise more debt capital.
   (5)   Cost of Debt
		 The capacity of a company to take debt depends on the cost of debt. In case the rate of interest on the
   debt capital is less, more debt capital can be utilised and vice versa.
   (6)   Tax Rate
		 The rate of tax affects the cost of debt. If the rate of tax is high, the cost of debt decreases. The reason
   is the deduction of interest on the debt capital from the profits considering it a part of expenses and a
   saving in taxes.
		 For example, suppose a company takes a loan of Rs. 100 and the rate of interest on this debt is 10%
   and the rate of tax is 30%. By deducting 10/- from the EBIT a saving of in tax will take place (If 10% on
   account of interest are not deducted, a tax of @ 30% shall have to be paid).
   (7)   Cost of Equity Capital
		 Cost of equity capital (it means the expectations of the equity shareholders from the company) is
   affected by the use of debt capital. If the debt capital is utilised more, it will increase the cost of the
   equity capital. The simple reason for this is that the greater use of debt capital increases the risk of the
   equity shareholders.
		 Therefore, the use of the debt capital can be made only to a limited level. If even after this level the
   debt capital is used further, the cost of equity capital starts increasing rapidly. It adversely affects the
   market value of the shares. This is not a good situation. Efforts should be made to avoid it.
   (8)   Floatation Costs
		 Floatation costs are those expenses which are incurred while issuing securities (e.g., equity shares,
   preference shares, debentures, etc.). These include commission of underwriters, brokerage, stationery
   expenses, etc. Generally, the cost of issuing debt capital is less than the share capital. This attracts the
   company towards debt capital.

                                                                                                           583
EP-CA&FM                                                                                        Capital Structure

  (9)    Risk Consideration: There are two types of risks in business –
          (i)   Operating Risk or Business Risk
		 This refers to the risk of inability to discharge permanent operating costs (e.g., rent of the building,
   payment of salary, insurance installment, etc.).
         (ii)   Financial Risk
		 This refers to the risk of inability to pay fixed financial payments (e.g., payment of interest,
   preference dividend, return of the debt capital, etc.) as promised by the company.
		
 The total risk of business depends on both these types of risks. If the operating risk in business is
 less, the financial risk can be faced which means that more debt capital can be utilised. On the
 contrary, if the operating risk is high, the financial risk likely occurring after the greater use of debt
 capital should be avoided.
 (10)    Flexibility
		 According to this principle, capital structure should be fairly flexible. Flexibility means that, if need be,
   amount of capital in the business could be increased or decreased easily. Reducing the amount of
   capital in business is possible only in case of debt capital or preference share capital.
		 If at any given time company has more capital than as necessary then both the above-mentioned
   capitals can be repaid. On the other hand, repayment of equity share capital is not possible by the
   company during its lifetime. Thus, from the viewpoint of flexibility to issue debt capital and preference
   share capital is the best.
  (11)   Control
		 According to this factor, at the time of preparing capital structure, it should be ensured that the control
   of the existing shareholders (owners) over the affairs of the company is not adversely affected.
		 If funds are raised by issuing equity shares, then the number of company’s shareholders will increase
   and it directly affects the control of existing shareholders. In other words, now the number of owners
   (shareholders) controlling the company increases.
		 This situation will not be acceptable to the existing shareholders. On the contrary, when funds are
   raised through debt capital, there is no effect on the control of the company because the debenture
   holders have no control over the affairs of the company. Thus, for those who support this principle debt
   capital is the best.
 (12)    Regulatory Framework
		 Capital structure is also influenced by government regulations. For instance, banking companies can
   raise funds by issuing share capital alone, not any other kind of security. Similarly, it is compulsory for
   other companies to maintain a given debt-equity ratio while raising funds.
		 Different ideal debt-equity ratios such as 2:1; 4:1; 6:1 have been determined for different industries. Also,
   the public issue of shares and debentures has to be made under SEBI guidelines.
 (13)    Stock Market Conditions
		 Stock market conditions refer to upward or downward trends in capital market. Both these conditions
   have their influence on the selection of sources of finance. When the market is dull, investors are mostly
   afraid of investing in the share capital due to high risk.


584
Capital Structure                                                                                      LESSON 15

		 On the contrary, when conditions in the capital market are cheerful, they treat investment in the share
   capital as the best choice to reap profits. Companies should, therefore, make selection of capital
   sources keeping in view the conditions prevailing in the capital market.
  (14)   Capital Structure of Other Companies
		 Capital structure is influenced by the industry to which a company is related. All companies related to
   a given industry produce almost similar products, their costs of production are similar, they depend on
   identical technology, they have similar profitability, and hence the pattern of their capital structure is
   almost similar.
		 Because of this fact, there are different debt- equity ratios prevalent in different industries. Hence, at the
   time of raising funds a company must take into consideration debt-equity ratio prevalent in the related
   industry.

 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND VALUATION
There is a theme that the capital structure should be conducive to increase in valuation of the firm. By valuation,
we mean that the market value or the realisable value of the owners’ equity should increase. This can happen in
case value of both components of the shareholders’ equity, i.e. share capital and retained earnings increases.
Value of the share capital is reflected in the market value of the firm in case the shares are traded on the stock
exchange. This market value, under ideal conditions, is indicative of the inherent value and is different from
both the face value and the book value. The capital structure should be such as maximises the inherent value
of the firm.
Retained earnings also have a book value, i.e. the value at which these earnings are carried in the books of
the firm. The inherent value of the retained earnings depends upon the future returns which these earnings can
generate for the owners. As earnings of the firm increase, its valuation also increases. Earnings can increase
either directly through increased level of operations of the firm or indirectly through decrease in cost of capital
of the firm. The direct increase in earnings is dependent upon the investment decisions and the changes in
capital structure have no explicit bearing upon these earnings. Capital structure plays an important part in
increase in earnings brought about by change in cost of different components of the structure.

 CAPITAL STRUCTURE THEORIES
There are basically four approaches to capital structure decision:
    1.   Net Income Approach
    2.   Net Operating Income Approach
    3.   Traditional Approach
    4.   Modigliani Miller (MM) Approach

 1. Net Income Approach
According to this approach there is a relationship between capital structure and the value of the firm and
therefore, the firm can affect its value by increasing or decreasing the debt proportion in the overall financial
mix. The Net Income Approach makes the following assumptions:
    1.   Cost of debt (Kd) is less than cost of equity (Ke) i.e. (Kd < Ke)
    2.   Both Kd and Ke. remain constant and increase i.e., in financial leverage i.e., use of more and more debt
         financing in the capital structure does not affect the risk perception of the investors.


                                                                                                               585
EP-CA&FM                                                                                          Capital Structure

   3.    There are no taxes.
Under this approach, the cost of debt capital, Kd and the cost of equity capital Ke remains unchanged when
D/S, the degree of leverage, varies. Here S stands for total capital employed (S= D + E). The constancy of Kd and
Ke with respect to the degree of leverage means that Ko the average cost of capital, measured by the following
formula declines as the degree of leverage increases.

                                                      D               E
                                        K0 = Kd x           + Ke x
                                                    (D+E)            (D+E)


This happens because when the degree of leverage increases, K­d which is lower than Ke receives a higher
weight in the calculation of K0. This can also be illustrated by a graph as shown below:




As our assumption is that the cost of debt and equity capital would not change with the change in the level of
leverage, K is seen to go down with the increasing proportion of debt in the capital.
Let us take a company that has an investment of ` 2,00,000 and a net operating income of ` 50,000. It is
considering two scenarios: (1) no debt and (2) equal levels of debt and equity of ` 1,00,000 each. Let us say that
the company finds out that the cost of equity is 12% and the cost of debt is 8%.
Calculations show that equity earnings would be ` 50,000 and ` 42,000 respectively in the two scenarios and
shown below. As the return expected on equity is 12%, we can say that this profit is 12% and therefore the market
value of equity would be such that this return becomes 12% on the same. This means that the market value of
equity would be ` 4,16,667 and ` 4,50,000 respectively in the two scenarios. Adding the market value of debt
and the market value of equity gives us the total value of the firm in the market.

There are two points to be noted here
    1.    As the cost of capital decreases the value of the firm would go up. Inverse relationship exists between
          the value of the firm and cost of capital for any given level of return.
    2.    As we increase the level of debt in the company, the value of the firm would go up even further. This
          would mean that the companies would like to employ as much debt as possible.

 2. Net Operating Income Approach
Net operating income approach is opposite to the Net income approach. According to NOI Approach, the market
value of the firm depends upon the net operating profit or EBIT and the overall cost of capital. The financing
mix or the capital structure is irrelevant and does not affect the value of the firm. The NOI Approach makes the
following assumptions:
    1.   The investors see the firm as a whole and thus capitalize the total earnings of the firm to find the value
         of the firm as a whole.
    2.   The overall cost of capital Ko, of the firm is constant and depends upon the business risk which also is
         assumed to be unchanged.
    3.   The cost of debt, Kd, is also taken as constant.


                                                                                                               589

   4.     The use of more and more debt in the capital structure increases the risk of the shareholders and thus
          results in the increase in the cost of equity capital i.e, Ke. The increase in Ke is such as to completely
          offset the benefits of employing cheaper debt, and
   5.     There is no taxes.
		 Under NOI Approach the relationship between the leverage and cost of capital has been represented
   in the Figure below:




Let us repeat the example we discussed earlier in net income approach. Let us take a company that has an
investment of ` 2,00,000 and net operating income of ` 50,000. It is considering two scenarios: 1) no debt and
2) equal levels of debt and equity of ` 100,000 each. Let us assume that the company finds out that the overall
cost of capital is 10% and the cost of debt is 8%.
As the return expected on total capital is 10 per cent, therefore the market value of total capital would be
such that this return becomes 10 per cent on the same. This means that the market value of capital would be `
5,00,000 in both the scenarios as our assumption in this case is that the total market value remains constant.
Also the value of debt would also remain constant as the cost of debt remains constant. This means that the
equity capitalization can be calculated by subtracting the market value of debt from the total market value of
the firm. Then the return on equity divided by the market capitalization of equity would give us the cost of equity.

There are two points to be noted here:
    –    As the cost of total capital and debt is constant, the cost of equity would go up or down with increasing
         or decreasing leverage, i.e., the amount of debt in the capital structure.
    –    This means that as we increase the level of debt in the company, the value of the firm doesn’t change
         and the company does not benefit by taking on debt. This would mean that the companies would like
         to employ as much equity as possible so as to reduce the risk of the company.

                                   Net Operating Income
          Value of firm =

                                   EBIT
          Value of firm =
                                    Ko
		Alternatively, Value of the Firm = Value of Equity + Value of Debt

                    Net Income after interest
          Ke =
                         Value of equity
		 Cost of equity can also be calculated as follows:
		Ke = K0 + (K0 – Kd) D/E

   The cost of equity capital increases with the increase in the proportion of debt capital.
   Cost of Equity can also be calculated using the following formula


                                                                                                                   591

  Ke = K0 + (K0 – Kd) D/E
  Ke = 10 + ( 10–5) 6,00,000/34,00,000 = 10.88%
  Ke = 10 + ( 10–5) 8,00,000/32,00,000 = 11.25%
  Ke = 10 + ( 10–5) 10,00,000/30,00,000 = 11.67%

		         (ii) It is lower than the A ltd. because B ltd. uses less debt in its capital structure. As the equity capitalisation
           is a linear function of the debt-to-equity ratio when we use the net operating income approach, the
           decline in required equity return offsets exactly the disadvantage of not employing so much in a way of
           “cheaper” debt funds.

 3. Traditional Approach
The NI Approach and NOI Approach hold extreme views on the relationship between the leverage, cost of
capital and the value of the firm. In practical situations, both these approaches seem to be unrealistic. The
traditional view takes a compromising view between the two and incorporates the basic philosophy of both.
The traditional approach to capital structure suggests that there exist an optimal debt to equity ratio where the
overall cost of capital is the minimum and market value of the firm is the maximum. On either side of this point,
changes in the financing mix can bring positive change to the value of the firm. Before this point, the marginal
cost of debt is less than a cost of equity and after this point vice-versa.
The traditional approach to capital structure advocates that there is a right combination of equity and debt in
the capital structure, at which the market value of a firm is maximum. As per this approach, debt should exist
in the capital structure only up to a specific point, beyond which, any increase in leverage would result in the
reduction in value of the firm.
It means that there exists an optimum value of debt to equity ratio at which the Weighted Average Cost of Capital
(WACC) is the lowest and the market value of the firm is the highest. Once the firm crosses that optimum value
of debt to equity ratio, the cost of equity rises to give a detrimental effect to the WACC. Above the threshold, the
WACC increases and market value of the firm starts a downward movement.
Assumptions under traditional approach:
      1.   The rate of interest on debt remains constant for a certain period and thereafter with an increase in
           leverage, it increases.
   2.      The expected rate by equity shareholders remains constant or increase gradually. After that, the equity
           shareholders starts perceiving a financial risk and then from the optimal point and the expected rate
           increases speedily.

    3.    As a result of the activity of rate of interest and expected rate of return, the WACC first decreases and
          then increases. The lowest point on the curve is optimal capital structure.

 4. Modigliani - Miller Theory
In 1958, Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller (MM) published a theory of modern financial management –
they concluded that the value of a firm depends solely on its future earnings stream, and hence its value is
unaffected by its debt/equity mix. In short, they concluded that a firm’s value stems from its assets, regardless
of how those assets are financed.
In their paper, MM began with a very restrictive set of assumptions, including perfect capital markets (which
implies zero taxes). And then they used an arbitrage proof to demonstrate that capital structure is irrelevant.
Under their assumptions, if debt financing resulted in a higher value for the firm than equity financing, then

                                                                                                                595
EP-CA&FM                                                                                           Capital Structure

investors who owned shares in a leveraged (debt-financed) firm could increase their income by selling those
shares and using the proceeds, plus borrowed funds, to buy shares in an unleveraged (all equity- financed) firm.
The simultaneous selling of shares in the leveraged firm and buying of shares in the unleveraged firm would
drive the prices of the stocks to the point where the values of the two firms would be identical. Thus, according
to MM Hypothesis, a firm’s stock price is not related to its mix of debt and equity financing.
Modigliani and Miller have restated and amplified the net operating income position in terms of three basic
propositions. These are as follows:
Proposition – I
The total value of a firm is equal to its expected operating income (PBIT when tax = 0) divided by the discount
rate appropriate to its risk class. It is independent of the degree of leverage.

                       EBIT        EBIT
   Vl = Vu =                  =
                       Kol         Kou

Here the subscript l is used to denote leveraged firm and subscript u is used to denote unleveraged firm.
Since the V (Value of the firm) as established by the above equation is a constant, then under the MM model,
when there are no taxes, the value of the firm is independent of its leverage. This implies that the weighted
average cost of capital to any firm is completely independent of its capital structure and the WACC for any firm,
regardless of the amount of debt it uses, is equal to the cost of equity of unleveraged firm employing no debt.
Proposition – II
The expected yield on equity, Ke is equal to Ko plus a premium. This premium is equal to the debt – equity ratio
times the difference between Ko and the yield on debt, Kd. This means that as the firm’s use of debt increases
its cost of equity also rises, and in a mathematically precise manner.
Proposition – III
The cut-off rate for investment decision making for a firm in a given risk class is not affected by the manner
in which the investment is financed. It emphasizes the point that investment and financing decisions are
independent because the average cost of capital is not affected by the financing decision.

   Solution:
   From the above particulars, it can be seen that the value of leverged firm Y is higher than that of the
   unleveraged firm. According to Modigliani Miller approach, such a situation cannot persist because equity
   investors would do well to sell their equity investment in firm Y and invest in the equity of firm X with
   personal leverage. For example, an equity investor who owns 1% equity in firm Y would do well to:
    –    Sell his equity in Firm Y for ` 6,667
    –    Borrow ` 4,000 at 5% interest on personal account and
    –    Buy 1.0667% of the equity of firm X with the amount of ` 10,667 that he has.
   Such an action will result in the following income:

     Particular                                                                                             (`)

     Income on investment in firm X                                                                   1066.70

     Less: Interest (4000 x 5%)                                                                        200.00

     Net Income                                                                                        866.70

   This net income of ` 866.7 is higher than a net income of ` 800 foregone by selling 1 percent equity of firm
   Y and the leverage ratio is the same in both the cases.
   When investors sell their equity in firm Y and buy the equity in firm X with personal leverage, the market
   value of equity of firm Y tends to decline and the market value of equity of firm X tends to rise. This process
   continues until the net market values of both the firms become equal because only then the possibility of
   earning a higher income for a given level of investment and leverage by arbitraging is eliminated. As a
   result of this the cost of capital for both the firms is the same.
   The above example explains that due to the arbitrage mechanism the value of a leveraged firm cannot be
   higher than that of an unleveraged firm, other things being equal. It can also be proved that the value of
   an unleveraged firm cannot be higher than that of leveraged firm, other things being equal.
   Let us assume the valuation of the two firms X and Y is the other way around and is as follows:
                                                                                                 (Amount in INR)

  If a situation like this arises, equity investors in firm X would do well to sell the equity in firm X and use the
  proceeds partly for investment in the equity of firm Y and partly for investment in the debt of firm Y. For
  example, an equity investor who owns 1 percent equity in firm X would do well to:
      –   Sell his 1% equity in firm X for ` 12,500
      –   Buy 1.01% of the equity and debt in firm Y involving an outlay of INR 10,773
  Such an action will result in an increase of income by INR 1727 without changing the risk shouldered by the
  investor. When investors resort to such a change, the market value of the equity of firm X tends to decline
  and the market value of the equity of firm Y tends to rise. This process continues until the total market
  value of both the firms becomes equal.

 CRITICISM OF MM HYPOTHESIS
If the MM theory was correct, managers would not need to concern themselves with capital structure decisions,
because such decisions would have no impact on stock prices. However, like most theories, MM’s results would
hold true only under a particular set of assumptions. Still, by showing the conditions under which capital structure
is irrelevant, MM provided important insights into when and how debt financing can affect the value of a firm.

 MM Hypothesis with Corporate Taxes
In 1963, MM added corporate taxes to their model. With corporate taxes considered, a firm’s stock price was
shown to be directly related to its use to debt financing – higher the percentage of debt financing, the higher
the stock price. Under the MM with tax theory, firms should use virtually 100% debt financing. The reason for
this result is the corporate tax structure – returns to stockholders come from after-tax earnings, but returns to
creditors are paid before tax. The effect of this tax treatment is that more of a company’s operating income is
left for investors when more debt financing is used.

 Empirical evidence against MM Hypothesis
In spite of the MM arguments, firms do not usually use anywhere close to 100% debt financing. In an attempt to
modify MM’s model to make it more consistent with actual behaviour, many of their assumptions were relaxed
in papers by other authors. In particular, the possibility of financial distress drastically changed the MM results.
In the modified model, tax savings cause the value of a firm to rise as more and more debt is used, but at some
point (the optimal structure), the value of the firm begins to fall with additional debt because the tax benefits are
more than offset by the increasing costs of potential financial distress.
The MM model as modified to include financial distress suggests to managers .
      –   that a certain amount of debt is good
      –   that too much debt is bad, and
      –   that there is an optimal amount of debt for every firm.

Thus, the modified MM theory, which is called the trade-off theory of capital structure, provides useful insights
into the factors that affect a firm’s optimal capital structure. Here the marginal costs and benefits of debt
financing are balanced against one another, and the result is an optimal capital structure that falls somewhere
between zero and 100% debt.

 Pecking Order Theory
One of the most influential theory of corporate leverage is Pecking Order Theory. It assumes that there is no
target capital structure and due to adverse selection, firms prefer internal finance to external finance. Even
when outside funds are necessary, debt is preferred to equity since issue of debt involves lower information
costs. The debt is preferred because issuing equity would bring external ownership into the company.

 EBIT - EPS Analysis
One widely used means of examining the effect of leverage is to analyse the relationship between earnings
before interest and taxes (EBIT) and earnings per share (EPS). The use of EBIT – EPS analysis indicates to
management the projected EPS for different financial plans. Generally, management wants to maximise EPS
if doing so also satisfies the primary goal of financial management - maximisation of the owner’s wealth as
represented by the value of business, i.e. the value of firm’s equity. If the firm attempts to use excessive amounts
of debt, shareholders ( who are risk - averters) may sell their shares, and thus its price will fall. While the use of
large amount of debt may result in higher EPS, it may also result in a reduction in the price of the firm’s equity.
The optimum financial structure for a firm (that is, the use of debt in relationship of equity and retained earnings
as sources of financing) should be the one which maximises the price of the equity.
Given the importance of earnings per share (EPS) as a measure of a firm’s performance, analysis of the impact
of financing alternatives on EPS is an important first step. Essentially, the method involves the comparison of
alternative methods of financing under various assumptions as to EBIT.
Let us assume that a firm has a capital structure of INR 1,00,000. The equity capital is of ` 100 each and debt
carries rate of interest of 10% p.a. We further assume that the firm has the following combination of components
of this structure:

                    Case No.                           Equity (%)                             Debt (%)

                       2.                                  75                                    25

                       3.                                  50                                    50

For calculating the impact on EPS of various levels of EBIT, we take five values of ` 5000, ` 7,500, ` 12,500 and
` 15,000. The tax rate is assumed to be 40 %.

If we increase the EBIT further, the impact on EPS is better still.
We can conclude from the above illustration that the firm should resort to financing its operations through
debt only beyond a threshold or indifference level in order to benefit from tax breaks provided by interest on
borrowings. In other words, debt is suitable if the EBIT is expanding rapidly. If the operations are shrinking, it
should change its capital structure immediately in favour of equity capital.

The indifference point of a firm (EBIT of ` 10000 in this case) varies from firm to firm but normally it approximates
the breakeven point.

 EBITDA ANALYSIS (EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAX, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION),
EBITDA, an acronym for “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,” is an often-used measure
of the value of a business. EBITDA is calculated by taking net income and adding interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization expenses back to it. EBITDA is used to analyze a company’s operating profitability before
non- operating expenses (such as interest and “other” non-core expenses) and non-cash charges (depreciation
and amortization).

 Analysis with EBITDA
EBIDTA enables analysts to exclude the impacts of non-operating activities and focus on the outcome of
operating decisions. Non-operating activities include interest expenses, tax rates, and large non-cash items
such as depreciation and amortization.
By removing the non-operating effects, EBITDA gives investors the ability to focus on the profitability of their
operations. This type of analysis is particularly important when comparing similar companies across a single
industry.

 Limitations of EBITDA
Factoring out interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization can make even completely unprofitable firms
appear to be fiscally healthy. The use of EBITDA as measure of financial health made these firms look attractive.
EBITDA numbers are easy to manipulate. If fraudulent accounting techniques are used to inflate revenues
and interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization are factored out of the equation, almost any company may
appears to be profitable and great.
Operating cash flow is a better measure of how much cash a company is generating because it adds non-cash
charges (depreciation and amortization) back to net income and includes the changes in working capital that
also use or provide cash (such as changes in receivables, payables and inventories). These working capital
factors are the key to determining how much cash a company is generating. If investors do not include changes
in working capital in their analysis and rely solely on EBITDA, they will miss clues that indicate whether a
company is losing money because it isn’t making any sales.
Despite various shortcomings, there are some good reasons for using EBITDA.
      1.   The first factor to consider is that EBITDA can be used as a shortcut to estimate the cash flow available
           to pay debt on long-term assets, such as equipment and other items with a lifespan measured in
           decades rather than years. Dividing EBITDA by the amount of required debt payments yields a debt
           coverage ratio. Factoring out the “ITDA” of EBITDA was designed to account for the cost of the long-
           term assets and provide a look at the profits that would be left after the cost of these tools was taken
           into consideration
   2.      Another factor is that EBITDA estimate to be reasonably accurate, the company under evaluation must
           have legitimate profitability. Using EBITDA to evaluate old-line industrial firms is likely to produce useful
           results. This idea was lost during the 1980s, when leveraged buyouts were fashionable, and EBITDA
           began to be used as a proxy for cash flow. This evolved into the more recent practice of using EBITDA
           to evaluate unprofitable dotcoms as well as firms such as telecoms, where technology upgrades are a
           constant expense.
   3.      EBITDA can also be used to compare companies against each other and against industry averages. In
           addition, EBITDA is a good measure of core profit trends because it eliminates some of the extraneous
           factors and allows a more “apples-to-apples” comparison.
Ultimately, EBITDA should not replace the measure of cash flow, which includes the significant factor of changes

in working capital. Remember “cash is king” because it shows “true” profitability and a company’s ability to
continue operations.

 MEASURES OF OPERATING AND FINANCIAL LEVERAGE
The term leverage refers to an increased means of accomplishing some purpose. Leverage is used to lifting
heavy objects, which may not be otherwise possible. In the financial point of view, leverage refers to furnish the
ability to use fixed cost assets or funds to increase the return to its shareholders.

 Definition of Leverage
James Horne has defined leverage as, “the employment of an asset or fund for which the firm pays a fixed cost
or fixed return.

 Types of Leverage
Leverage can be classified into three major headings according to the nature of the finance mix of the company.




The company may use financial or leverage or operating leverage, to increase the EBIT and EPS.
The leverage associated with investment activities is called as operating leverage. It is caused due to fixed
operating expenses in the company. Operating leverage may be defined as the company’s ability to use fixed
operating costs to magnify the effects of changes in sales on its earnings before interest and taxes. Operating
leverage consists of two important costs viz., fixed cost and variable cost. When the company is said to have
a high degree of operating leverage if it employs a great amount of fixed cost and smaller amount of variable
cost. Thus, the degree of operating leverage depends upon the amount of various cost structure. Operating
leverage can be determined with the help of a break even analysis.
Operating leverage can be calculated with the help of the following formula:

                                                               Contribution
                         Operating Leverage =
                                                          Operating Profit (EBIT )

 Degree of Operating Leverage
The degree of operating leverage may be defined as percentage change in the operating income (EBIT) resulting
from a percentage change in the sales. It can be calculated with the help of the following formula:

                                            Percentage change in EBIT

  Comments
  Operating leverage for Company B is higher than that of Company A ; Company B has a higher degree of
  operating risk. The tendency of operating profit may vary proportionately with sales, is higher for Company
  B as compared to Company A.

 Uses of Operating Leverage
Operating leverage is one of the techniques to measure the impact of changes in sales which lead for change in
the profits of the company. If any change in the sales, it will lead to corresponding changes in profit. Operating
leverage helps to identify the position of fixed cost and variable cost.

Operating leverage measures the relationship between the sales and revenue of the company during
a particular period. Operating leverage helps to understand the level of fixed cost which is invested in the
operating expenses of business activities. It describes the overall position of the fixed operating cost.

 FINANCIAL LEVERAGE
A leverage activity with financing activities is called financial leverage. Financial leverage represents the
relationship between the company’s earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) or operating profit and the earning
available to equity shareholders.
Financial leverage is defined as “the ability of a firm to use fixed financial charges to magnify the effects of
changes in EBIT on the earnings per share”. It involves the use of funds obtained at a fixed cost in the hope
of increasing the return to the shareholders. “The use of long-term fixed interest bearing debt and preference
share capital along with share capital is called financial leverage or trading on equity”.
Financial leverage may be favourable or unfavourable depends upon the use of fixed cost funds.
Favourable financial leverage occurs when the company earns more on the assets purchased with the funds,
then the fixed cost of their use. Hence, it is also called as positive financial leverage.
Unfavourable financial leverage occurs when the company does not earn as much as the funds cost. Hence, it
is also called as negative financial leverage.
Financial leverage can be calculated with the help of the following formula:

                                                          Operating Profit (EBIT)
                             Financial Leverage =
                                                            Profit Before Tax

 Degree of Financial Leverage
Degree of financial leverage may be defined as the percentage change in taxable profit as a result of percentage
change in earnings before interest and tax (EBIT). This can be calculated by the following formula :-

                                         Percentage change in taxable Income
                           DFL =
                                        Percentage change in operating income

 Alternative Definition of Financial Leverage
According to Gitmar, “financial leverage is the ability of a firm to use fixed financial changes to magnify the
effects of change in EBIT on its EPS”.

                                               Percentage change in EPS
                                   DFL =

 Uses of Financial Leverage
Financial leverage helps to examine the relationship between EBIT and EPS.
Financial leverage measures the percentage of change in taxable income to the percentage change in EBIT.
It locates the correct profitable financial decision regarding capital structure of the company. It is one of the
important devices which is used to measure the fixed cost proportion with the total capital of the company. If
the firm acquires fixed cost funds at a higher cost, then the earnings from those assets, the earning per share
and return on equity capital will decrease. The impact of financial leverage can be understood with the help of
the following exercise.

  Illustration 7:

 Indifference Point
It is the point at which different sets of debt ratios (percentage of debt to total capital employed in the company)
gives the same EPS. Indifference level is the level of EBIT beyond which the benefits of financial leverage began
to operate with respect to EPS.
In other words, if the expected levels of EBIT exceed the indifference level of EBIT, the use of fixed charge
sources (debt) would be favorable from the point of view of EPS. In nutshell, financial leverage is favorable &
leads to an increase in the EPS.
On the other hand, if the expected level of EBIT is less than the indifference point, the advantage of EPS would
be available from the use of equity capital.
The indifference point between two financial plans can be calculated by using the following formula:

                      (EBIT – Interest) (1-t) – PD (1+t)            (EBIT – Interest) (1-t) – PD(1+t)
                                                             =
                      No of equity shares in Plan A                 No of equity shares in Plan B


   Illustration 9:
   A new project requires a capital outlay of ` 400 lakhs. The required amount to be raised either fully by
   equity shares of ` 100 each or by equity shares of the value of ` 200 lakhs and by loan of ` 200 lakhs at
   15% interest. Assuming a tax rate of 40%, calculate the figure of EBIT that would keep the equity investors
   indifferent to the two options.
   Solution:

                                               Option A (Full Equity)                 Option B (Debt + Equity)

   Let us assume Indifference Level of EBIT is ` X. Thus

      {(X – 0) (1 – 0.4) – 0}               (X – 30,00,000) (1 – 0.4) – 0
                                    =
             4,00,000                                  2,00,000

       0.6X                  0.6X – 18,00,000
                     =
     4,00,000                   2,00,000

                (4,00,000)              {0.6X – 18,00,000}
    0.6X =
                      1                     2,00,000
   0.6X = 1.2X - 36,00,000
   36,00,000 = 1.2X - 0.6X
   0.6X = 36,00,000 X = ` 60,00,000
   Thus the EPS under two different financial options will be equal at ` 60 lakhs EBIT Level. This can be
   verified as follows:

 COMBINED LEVERAGE
When the company uses both financial and operating leverage to magnification of any change in sales into a
larger relative changes in earning per share. Combined leverage is also called as composite leverage or total
leverage.

Combined leverage expresses the relationship between the revenue in the account of sales and the taxable
income. Combined leverage can be calculated with the help of the following formulas:

 Degree of Combined Leverage
The percentage change in a firm’s earning per share (EPS) results from one percent change in sales. This is also
equal to the firm’s degree of operating leverage (DOL) times its degree of financial leverage (DFL) at a particular
level of sales.

 WORKING CAPITAL LEVERAGE
One of the new models of leverage is working capital leverage which is used to locate the investment in
working capital or current assets in the company.
Working capital leverage measures the sensitivity of return in investment of charges in the level of current
assets.

                                                             Percentage Change in ROI

                                                       Percentage Change in Working Capital

If the earnings are not affected by the changes in current assets, the working capital leverage can be calculated
with the help of the following formula.

                                                                          CA

where,
CA = Current Assets TA = Total Assets

∆ CA = Changes in the level of Current Assets

 EFFECTS OF LEVERAGE ON SHAREHOLDERS’ RETURNS
Financial plan is one of the vital decisions of a firm because a financial plan affects the market value, cost of
capital and shareholders return of a firm. The Proportion of Debt to Equity in the financial plan of a firm is called
leverage. Since optimal debt ratio influences a firm’s market value and shareholder’s return, different firms
use different debt ratio at different levels to maximize market value and shareholders return. Leverage has
statistically significant effect on the shareholders’ return and proper management of leverage can maximize
the value of EPS.

 1. Operating Leverage Effect : % Change in EBIT is more than % Change in Sale
If % change of earning before interest and tax is more than % change in sale, this operating leverage will effect
ROE positively because at this level, per unit fixed cost will decrease and small increase in sale will boost EBIT.

If EBIT will increase, ROE will also increase. Operating Leverage indicates, how will EBIT change if sales
changes. 2:1 ratio of operating leverage means 100% increase in sales will increase EBIT by 200%. As interest
is fixed cost, so ROE will increase.
   A.    Situation: High Operating Leverage:
		 Too high operating leverage is not good, it may be highly risky.
   B.    Situation: Low Operating Leverage:
		 Low operating leverage may be useful when sale market is fluctuating.

 2. Effect of Financial Leverage on ROE
If we have to check real effect of leverage on ROE, we have to study financial leverage. Financial leverage
refers to the use of debt to acquire additional assets. Financial leverage may decrease or increase return on
equity in different conditions.
   A.    Situation: High Financial Leverage:
		 Financial over-leveraging means incurring a huge debt by borrowing funds at a lower rate of interest
   and utilizing the excess funds in high risk investments in order to maximize returns.
   B.    Situation: Low Financial Leverage:
Financial low-leveraging means incurring a low debt by borrowing funds. It may affect positively, if decrease the
value of bought asset with this low debt.

 3. Effect of High Operating leverage and High Financial Leverage
It will increase ROE but it is highly risky also.

 4. Effect of Low Operating leverage and High Financial Leverage
It is optimum combination for bringing optimum return on equity.

 RISK AND LEVERAGE
Risk is the probability that the future revenue streams of a firm shall show a variation from the expected figures.
The variation is normally on the negative or the lower side because a positive variation reduces the investment
risk and a reduction of risk is always welcome.
For linkage with leverage, we can divide risk into two broad categories, i.e. business risk and financial risk.
Business risk pertains to risks associated with day to day operations of the firm. For example, decisions made
regarding purchase of raw materials, manufacturing expenses and administrative expenses, etc. change the
business risk profile of the firm. These decisions have an impact upon the operational profitability of the firm,
i.e. the profits before interest and taxes. Financial risk, on the other hand, is associated with introduction of fixed
interest bearing debt obligations in the capital structure of the firm. These obligations create a prior charge on
EBIT before distribution of post tax profits among the owners.
The distinction between business risk and financial risk can be clarified through the following illustration:




                                                                                                                  613

Business risk is associated with the impact of item no. (3) above of changes in item nos. (1) and (2). The “Cost of
goods sold” item consists of cost of raw materials, labour cost, factory rent and other manufacturing expenses.
Out of these elements, labour cost and factory rent are fixed costs while the rest are variable depending upon
the level of sales. Now if the fixed costs are increased the expectation would be that the sales would rise in
anticipated proportion. However, if the sales do not rise as anticipated, business risk of the firm increases.
Till now we have assumed that the firm has no debt and as such, no interest cost. Let us assume that the firm
raises debt with yearly interest payment of ` 500 lacs. The Profit & loss account would now be extended as
shown below:

 Sr.                               Particulars                              Amount(` in lakh)
 No.

  (a)   EBIT                                                                             2,000

  (b)   Less : Interest                                                                    500           (4)

  (c)   Profit before tax                                                                1,500

  (d)   Less : Tax @ 40%                                                                   600

  (e)   Profit after Tax                                                                   900           (5)

Now item no. (5) i.e. profit after tax is dependent on interest payments which are fixed. If EBIT decreases as a
result of changes in items (1) and (2) and item no. (4) remains the same, the venture would become riskier as
an additional element of financial risk has been built in. The change in risk profile of the firm has been caused
by change in its leverage. The changes in fixed labour costs and factory rent are referred to as changes in
operating leverage while the changes in fixed interest costs are described as changes in financial leverage.
A firm has operating leverage when it can expand output and sales without a proportionate increase in fixed
costs. Let us assume that in our earlier illustration, cost of sales has the following break-up:

We see that while net sales have increased by 100%, the EBIT has increased by 175%, thanks to the operating
leverage provided by the fixed factory rent and the fixed component of manufacturing expenses and selling
expenses, which we assume to be ` 500 lacs each.

subsequent years respectively, profitability of the firm would change as under:

leverage.

borrowing a sum of ` 15 crores from the bank carrying fixed interest of 12% p.a. The capacity is also simultaneously

By creating financial leverage, the firm has not only ensured rise in EBIT but in PAT as well. But at the same time,
it has increased its financial risk, i.e. the risk of default on repayment of loan amount and the interest on loan.

We can see that in case of financial leverage, the impact on PAT upon reduction in capacity utilisation is much
severe. The degree of financial leverage can be calculated by the rate of change of PAT for a one percent
change in sales.

 Relationship between Financial Risk and Financial Leverage
As the financial leverage increases, the break-even point of the company increases and the company now
has to sell more of its product (or service) in order to break even. High financial leverage increases the risk to
banks and other lenders because of the higher probability of bankruptcy and the risk to stockholders because
greater losses may be incurred if the company goes bankrupt. Increase in financial leverage, increases the risk
to stockholders because the higher leverage will cause greater volatility in earnings and greater volatility in
the stock price.

 Hamada Equation
  The equation draws upon the Modigliani-Miller theorem on capital structure and extends an analysis to
  quantify the effect of financial leverage on a firm. Beta is a measure of volatility or systemic risk relative to
  the overall market. The Hamada equation, then, shows how the beta of a firm changes with leverage. The
  higher the beta coefficient, the higher the risk associated with the firm. The significant facets of Hamada
  equation are as under:
 l The Hamada equation is a method of analysing a firm’s cost of capital as it uses additional financial
      leverage.
 l It draws upon the Modigliani-Miller theorem on capital structure.

 l The higher the Hamada equation beta coefficient, the higher the risk associated with the firm.

Robert Hamada is a former professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Hamada
started teaching at the university in 1966 and served as the dean of the business school from 1993 to 2001. His
equation appeared in his paper, “The Effect of the Firm’s Capital Structure on the Systemic Risk of Common
Stocks” in the Journal of Finance in May 1972.
The formula for the Hamada equation is:

                                                               D 
                                           βL βu 1 + (1 - T )   
                                           =
                                                               E

Where:

ßL = Levered beta
ßu = Unlevered beta*
T = Tax Rate
D/E = Debt to Equity Ratio*
* Unlevered beta is the market risk of a company without the impact of debt.
* Debt-to-equity ratio is a measure of a company’s financial leverage.
  Illustration 15:
  A company has a debt to equity ratio of 0.70:1.00, a tax rate of 34%, and an unlevered beta of 0.75.
  Calculate Hamada coefficient or leveraged beta.
  Solution:
  The Hamada coefficient or leveraged beta would be:

   ßL = ßU [ 1+ (1-T) (D/E)]
   0.75 [1 + (1-.34) (.70)] = 1.09
   Here, the leveraged beta is 1.09,
   It means that the financial leverage of the company increases the overall risk by the beta amount of 0.34
   (1.09 less .75) or 34%.
   Therefore, as the beta of the coefficient rises, the associated risk of having higher debt also rises.



                                               LESSON ROUND-UP

    l Capital Structure of a firm is a reflection of the overall investment and financing strategy of the firm. It
        shows how much reliance is being placed by the firm on external sources of finance and how much
        internal accruals are being used to finance expansions.

    l Optimal capital structure means arrangement of various components of the structure in tune with both
        the long-term and short term objectives of the firm.

    l The four Capital Structure Theories are—Net Income Approach, Net Operating Income Approach,
        Traditional Approach and Modigliani Miller Approach.

    l Net income approach provides that the cost of debt capital, Kd and the cost of equity capital Ke remains
        unchanged when the degree of leverage, varies.

    l Net Operating Income approach states that cost of the capital for the whole firm remains constant,
        irrespective of the leverage employed in the firm.

    l Traditional Approach to capital structure advocates that there is a right combination of equity and debtin
        capital structure, at which market value of the firms is maximum.

    l Modigliani and Miller have restated the net operating income position in terms of three basic propositions:

 		Proposition I – The total value of a firm is equal to its expected operating income divided by the discount
   rate appropriate to its risk class.

 		 Proposition II – The expected yield on equity, Ke is equal to Ko plus a premium.

 		 Proposition III – The cut off rate for investment decision making for a firm in a given risk class is not
    affected by the manner in which the investment is financed.

    l Leverage refers to relationship between two variables as reflected in a unit change in one variable consequent
        upon a unit change in another variable.

    l Two major types of Leverages are: Financial leverage and operating leverage.

    l Financial leverage measures the extent to which the cost of project has been funded by borrowed money
        as compared to owner’s equity.

    l EBIT –EPS Analysis indicates the projected EPS for different financial plans.

                                                     GLOSSARY

 Optimal Capital Structure: An optimal capital structure is the best mix of debt and equity financing that
 maximizes a company’s market value while minimizing its cost of capital.
 Target Capital Structure: The target capital structure of a company refers to the capital which the company
 is striving to obtain. In other words, target capital structure describes the mix of debt, preferred stock and
 common equity which is expected to optimize the stock price of company.
 Capital Structure Analysis: Capital structure analysis is a periodic evaluation of all components of the debt
 and equity financing used by a business. The intent of the analysis is to evaluate what combination of debt
 and equity the business should have.
 Leverage Ratio: A leverage ratio is any one of several financial measurements that look at how much capital
 comes in the form of debt (loans) or assesses the ability of a company to meet its financial obligations.
 Capital Structure Theory: In financial management, capital structure theory refers to a systematic approach
 to financing business activities through a combination of equities and liabilities. There are several competing
 capital structure theories, each of which explores the relationship between debt financing, equity financing,
 and the market value of the firm slightly differently.

 INTRODUCTION

 Meaning of Dividend
The term dividend refers to that part of profits of a company which is distributed by the company among
its shareholders. It is the reward of the shareholders for investments made by them in the shares of the
company.

In other words, it is the return that a shareholder gets from the company out of profit on his shareholding.

According to the Institute of Chartered Accountant of India, “A dividend is a distribution to shareholders out of
profit or reserves available for this purpose.”

 DIVIDEND POLICY
The term dividend policy refers to the policy concerning quantum of profit to be distributed as dividend. The
concept of dividend policies implies that companies through their Board of Directors evolve a pattern of dividend
payment which has a bearing on future action.

  “Dividend policy determines the division of earnings between payments to shareholders and retained
  earnings.”

                                                                                          -Weston and Brigham

The dividend decision is not an easy task for the managers as dividend constitutes the cash flow that accrues
to equity holders where as retained earnings are one of the most significant sources of funds for financing
the corporate growth. Both dividend and growth are desirable but are conflicting goals to each other. Higher
dividend means less retained earnings and vice versa.

The formulation of the dividend policy poses many problems. On the one hand theory would seem to dictate
that the firm should retain all funds which can be employed at a higher rate than the capitalization rate; on the
other hand, stock-holders preference must be considered.

 KINDS (FORMS) OF DIVIDEND
Dividends can be classified in various forms. Dividends paid in the ordinary course of business are known as
Profit dividends, while dividends paid out of capital are known as Liquidation dividends. Dividends may also be
classified on the basis of medium in which they are paid:

A company may pay dividend in different forms which are shown in following figures as follows:

                                      Fig.- 1 Different forms of Dividend
1) Equity Dividend:
The dividend paid on equity shares is called Equity Dividend. The rate of equity dividend is set (recommended)
by the board of directors of a business firm and approved by their shareholders.
2) Preference Dividend:
Preference dividend is paid on Preference Shares. At the time of issue of such shares, the rate of dividend is
mentioned which remains fixed in nature. This dividend on preference shares is paid before equity dividend.
The board of directors of a business firm does not put any recommendation towards preference dividend viz.
rate, payment mode etc.
3) Interim Dividend:
Interim dividend is paid by a company for the current year before the accounts for that period have been closed.
Such dividend is paid when the company has heavy earning during the year.
4) Regular Dividend:
Payment of dividend at the usual rate is termed as regular dividend. The investors such as retired persons,
widows and other economically weaker person prefer to get regular dividends.
5) Cash Dividend:
A cash dividend is a usual method of paying dividends. Payment of dividend in cash results in outflow of funds

                                                                                                            625
EP-CA&FM                                                                                        Dividend Decisions

and reduces the company’s net worth, though the shareholders get an opportunity to invest the cash in any
manner they desire. This is why the ordinary shareholders prefer to receive dividends in cash. But the firm must
have adequate liquid resources at its disposal or provide for such resources so that its liquidity position is not
adversely affected on account of cash dividends.
6) Stock Dividend:
Stock dividend means the issue of bonus shares to the existing shareholders. If a company does not have
liquid resources it is better to declare stock dividend. Stock dividend amounts to capitalization of earnings and
distribution of profits among the existing shareholders without affecting the cash position of the firm.
7) Scrip or Bond Dividend:
A scrip dividend promises to pay the shareholders at a future specific date. In case a company does not have
sufficient funds to pay dividends in cash, it may issue notes or bonds for amounts due to the shareholders. The
objective of scrip dividend is to postpone the immediate payment of cash. A scrip dividend bears interest and is
accepted as a collateral security.
8) Property Dividend:
Property dividends are paid in the form of some assets other than cash. They are distributed under exceptional
circumstances and are not popular in India.
9) Composite Dividend:
When dividend is paid partly in cash and partly in the form of property then it is known as composite dividend.
10) Optional Dividend:
Instead of paying composite dividend, if the company gives option to its shareholders either for cash dividend
or for property dividend then it is called option dividend.
11) Extra or Special Dividend:
Special dividend is an abnormal and non-recurring form of dividend, when the management of company does
not want to make frequent changes in the regular rate of dividend but company is having good amount of profits
or undistributed reserves then they can declare extra or special dividend.

 STOCK SPLITS
A stock split is a decision by a company’s board of directors to increase the number of shares outstanding by
issuing more shares to current shareholders. For example, in a 2-for-1 stock split, a shareholder receives an
additional share for each share held. So, if a company had 10 million shares outstanding before the split, it will
have 20 million shares outstanding after a 2-for-1 split. Generally a company announces a stock split when the
price of the shares has risen to the point that it might be unappealing to investors who are more comfortable
with lower-priced securities.
For investors, it can be pretty exciting to hear that a stock you own is about to be split, because a share price
that is too high is a good problem to have and one that’s typically confronted by successful and growing
companies. While a split doesn’t actually make your investment any more valuable in and of itself, a lower
share price and the resulting increase in trading liquidity can certainly attract additional investors.

 Stock Split Example
Suppose, a company has 2000 stocks each stock is worth 20 rupees. Now, if the company wants to increase
the number of stocks, then it will split them. This means that the total number of stocks increases but there will
be no impact on the cost of these stocks. Suppose, the company has split it in the ratio of 2:1, then:

626
Dividend Decisions                                                                                      LESSON 16

Earlier, 1 stock = 20 rupees
After a 2:1 split,
1 stock= 10 rupees (per share price/number of parts in which split has occurred i.e. 20/2 here)
This means that the number of stocks will now be 4,000 but the total cost of stocks remains at 40,000.

 Reason Behind Stocks Split
The following reasons facilitate this split:
    1.   One of the basic reasons behind the stock split is the inability of investors to afford the share. Once the
         share prices hit a specific high price, companies decide to go for a stock split since it will allow more
         investors to own stocks at a lower price.
    2.   Once the number of shares increases, it leads to greater liquidity in stocks. The increased liquidity
         eases trading for buyers and sellers without any major impact on share prices. Due to this companies
         can repurchase their shares at a lower cost as their order will not increase the share price of more liquid
         stock.
    3.   The number of shares owned by investors’ increases. Now, after some time, when share prices reach a
         high, the investor will enjoy more profit.
    4.   Sometimes, the split is executed to meet the minimum criteria to stay listed on the exchange. This
         usually happens in the case of a reversed stock split.

 SHARE REPURCHASE
A stock buyback occurs when a company buys back its shares from the marketplace with its accumulated cash.
Also known as a share repurchase, a stock buyback allows a company to re-invest in itself. The repurchased
shares are absorbed by the company, reducing the number of outstanding shares on the market. Because there
are fewer shares on the market, the relative ownership stake of each investor increases.
Reasons of share repurchase:
    l    The board might feel that the company’s stock is undervalued, making it a good investment.
    l    Investors often perceive a buyback as an expression of confidence by the company.
    l    If the excess cash is a windfall, the company may not want to commit to paying a dividend (if it doesn’t
         already) or to increasing its existing dividend on an ongoing basis (if it already pays a dividend). An
         ongoing dividend can burden a company during lean times if it’s maintained, and leave investors upset
         if it’s cut.
    l    The company’s large shareholders may not want the extra tax burden of an increased dividend. Unlike
         dividends, share-repurchase programs don’t have immediate tax implications for shareholders, as
         there’s no payment to investors.
    l    The company may wish to offset the dilution caused by generous employee stock-option plans.

 Impact of a Share Repurchase
When a company buys back shares, the total number of shares outstanding diminishes. It paves the way for a
few different phenomena.
First, technical analysis metrics such as earnings per share (EPS) or cash flow per share (CFPS) will increase due
to a decrease in the denominator used to produce the figures. Thus, investors must be wary of the situation, as

                                                                                                                627
EP-CA&FM                                                                                        Dividend Decisions

EPS and CFPS will become artificially inflated – meaning that the increase cannot be attributed to economic
value creation activities such as boosting earnings or cutting costs.
Second, following the concept of supply and demand, we can predict an increase in the stock price. Assuming
that the demand for the stock remains constant in the face of a reduction in supply, we can project that the price
of the stock will increase. Once again, investors must be wary of the phenomenon as it may not result from
legitimate improvements in the business’ financial health.

 DETERMINANTS OF DIVIDEND POLICY
A company has to follows so many instructions and procedures for making a suitable dividend policy. These
can be analyzed as follows:




                                  Fig.- 2 Determinants (Factors) of Dividend
1. Legal Restrictions:
As regards cash dividend policy several legal constraints bear upon it – a firm may not pay a dividend which
will impair capital. Dividend must be paid out of firm’s earnings/current earnings. Contract/ Agreements for
bonds/loans may restrict dividend payments. The purpose of legal restriction is to ensure that the payment of
dividend may not cause insolvency.

Dividend Decisions                                                                                       LESSON 16

2. Magnitude and Trend of Earnings:
The amount and trend of earnings is an important aspect of dividend policy. It is rather the starting point of the
dividend policy. As dividends can be paid only out of present or past year’s profits, earnings of a company fix
the upper limits on dividends. The dividends should, generally, be paid out of current year’s earnings only as the
retained earnings of the previous years because more or less a part of permanent investment in the business
is to earn current profits. The past trend of the company’s earnings should also be kept in consideration while
making the dividend decision.
3. Desire and Type of Shareholders:
Although, legally, the discretion as to whether to declare dividend or not has been left with the Board of Directors,
the directors should give importance to the desires of shareholders in the declaration of dividends as they are
the representatives of shareholders. Desires of shareholders for dividends depend upon their economic status.
Investors, such as retired persons, widows and other economically weaker persons view dividends as a source
of funds to meet their day-to-day living expenses. To benefit such investors, the companies should pay regular
dividends. On the other hand, a wealthy investor in a high income tax bracket may not benefit by high current
dividend incomes. Such an investor may be interested in lower current dividends and high capital gains.
4. Nature of Industry:
Nature of industry to which the company is engaged also considerably affects the dividend policy. Certain
industries have a comparatively steady and stable demand irrespective of the prevailing economic conditions.
5. Age of the Company:
The age of the company also influences the dividend decision of a company. A newly established concern
has to limit payment of dividend and retain substantial part of earnings for financing its future growth and
development, while older companies which have established sufficient reserves can afford to pay liberal
dividends.
6. Future Financial Requirements:
It is not only the desires of the shareholders but also future financial requirements of the company that have to
be taken into consideration while making a dividend decision. The management of a concern has to reconcile
the conflicting interests of shareholders and those of the company’s financial needs.
7. Taxation Policy:
High taxation reduces the earnings of the companies and consequently the rate of dividend is lowered down.
Sometimes Government levies dividend-tax on distribution of dividend beyond a certain limit. It also affects the
rate of capital formation.
8. Policy of Control:
Policy of control is another determining factor in so far as dividends are concerned. If the directors want to have
control on company, they would not like to add new shareholders and therefore declare a dividend at low rate,
because by adding new shareholders they fear dilution of control and diversion of policies and programmes of
the existing management. So, they prefer to meet the needs through retained earnings. If the directors do not
bother about the control of affairs they will follow a liberal dividend policy. Thus control is an influencing factor
in framing the dividend policy.
9. Stage of business Cycle:
The demand for capital expenditure, money, supply, etc. changes during the different stages of a business
cycle, as a result, dividend policy may fluctuate from time to time.


                                                                                                                629
EP-CA&FM                                                                                         Dividend Decisions

10. Cost of Capital:
If the cost of capital involved in external financing is greater than the cost of internally generated funds, a
corporation adopts a conservative dividend policy.
11. Regularity:
Some corporations consider that regularity in payment of dividend is more important than anything else. They
may use past earnings to pay dividends regularly irrespective of whether they have current profits or not.
12. Requirements of Institutional Investors:
Dividend policy of a company can be affected by the requirements of institutional investors such as financial
institutions, banks, insurance corporations, etc. These investors usually favor policy of regular payment of cash
dividends and stipulate their own terms with regard to payment of dividend on equity shares.
13. Liquid Resources:
The dividend policy of a firm is also influenced by the availability of liquid resources. Although a firm may have
sufficient available profits to declare dividends, yet it may not be desirable to pay dividends if it does not have
sufficient liquid resources. Hence, the liquidity position of a company is an important consideration in paying
dividends.

 TYPES OF DIVIDEND POLICY




1) REGULAR DIVIDEND POLICY:
Payment of dividend at the usual rate is termed as regular dividend. The investors such as retired persons,
widows and other economically weaker person prefer to get regular dividends.
A regular dividend policy offers the following advantages:
   (a)   It establishes a profitable record of the company.
   (b)   It creates confidence among the shareholders.
   (c)   It aids in long-term financing and renders financing easier.
   (d)   It stabilizes the market value of shares.
   (e)   The ordinary shareholders view dividends as a source of funds to meet their day-to-day living expenses.
   (f)   If profits are not distributed regularly and are retained, the shareholders may have to pay a higher rate
         of tax in the year when accumulated profits are distributed.
However, it must be remembered that regular dividends can be maintained only by companies of long standing
and stable earnings. A company should establish the regular dividend at a lower rate as compared to the
average earnings of the company.

2) STABLE DIVIDEND POLICY:
The term ‘stability of dividend’ means consistency or lack of variability in the stream of dividend payments.
In more precise terms, it means payment of certain minimum amount of dividend regularly. A stable dividend
policy may be established in any of the following three forms:
   a)   Constant Dividend Policy:
		 Some companies follow a policy of paying fixed dividend per share irrespective of the level of earnings
   year after year. Such, firms, usually, create a ‘Reserve for Dividend Equalization’ to enable them to pay
   the fixed dividend even in the year when the earnings are not sufficient or when there are losses. A
   policy of constant dividend per share is most suitable to concerns whose earning is expected to remain
   stable over a number of years.




                                       Constant Dividend per share
   b)   Constant payout Ratio:
		 Constant pay-out ratio means payment of a fixed percentage of net earnings as dividends every year.
   The amount of dividend in such a policy fluctuates in direct proportion to the earnings of the company.
   The policy of constant pay-out is preferred by the firms because it is related to their ability to pay
   dividends.




                                     Constant Dividend Pay-out Ratio

                                                                                                         631
EP-CA&FM                                                                                         Dividend Decisions

    c)      Stable Rupee Dividend Plus Extra Dividend:
Some companies follow a policy of paying constant low dividend per share plus an extra dividend in the years
of high profits. Such a policy is most suitable to the firm having fluctuating earnings from year to year.
Advantages of Stable Dividend Policy:
A stable dividend policy is advantageous to both the investors and the company on account of the following:
      i)    It is sign of continued normal operations of the company.
      ii)   It stabilizes the market value of shares.
   iii)     It creates confidence among the investors.
   iv)      It provides a source of livelihood to those investors who view dividends as a source of funds to meet
            day-to-day expenses.
    v)      It meets the requirements of institutional investors who prefer companies with stable dividends.
   vi)      It improves the credit standing and makes financing easier.
   vii)     It results in a continuous flow to the national income stream and thus helps in the stabilization of
            national economy.
3) IRREGULAR DIVIDEND POLICY:
Some companies follow irregular dividend payments on account of the following: 		
      i)    Uncertainty of earnings
      ii)   Unsuccessful business operations
   iii)     Lack of liquid resources
   iv)      Fear of adverse effects of regular dividends on the financial standing of the company.
4) NO DIVIDEND POLICY:
A company may follow a policy of paying no dividends presently because of its unfavorable working capital
position or on account of requirements of funds for future expansion and growth.

 ESSENTIALS OF A SOUND DIVIDEND POLICY
Following are the essentials of a sound dividend policy of a company:
1. Stability:
Stability in dividend distribution implies regularity in payment of dividend. If a company pays high dividend in a
year but fails to pay any dividend next year, then it can not be said as good. On the other hand, if a company
pays dividend each year even though at a medium rate, its shareholders will remain satisfied and its shares will
not be subjected to high speculation.
2. Gradually Rising Dividends:
The management of the company should always try to make some increase in dividend rate each year, though
this increase will depend on increase in income of the company. If there are huge profits in any year then in that
year the company should distribute additional or special dividend.
3. Distribution of Cash Dividend:
Dividend should be paid in cash. But, if the amounts of reserves and funds in the company become very high,

632
Dividend Decisions                                                                                     LESSON 16

then stock dividend may also be declared. But the distribution of stock dividend should remain within reasonable
limits otherwise the company may become victim of over-capitalization.
4. Moderate Start:
In the beginning years of company’s incorporation, dividend should be declared at lower rates for some years so
that company’s financial position may become sound. Afterwards with the growth and progress of the company,
dividend rates may be increased gradually.
5. Other factors:
Dividend should be paid out of earned profits only. If there is carry forward of past losses, then dividend should
not be declared till these are set off. Though, the dividend is usually paid only once in a year in order to keep
the shareholders in high spirits, interim dividends should also be declared.

 DIVIDEND THEORIES / DIVIDEND MODELS
Relationship between Dividend Policy and Value of Firm:
Dividend decision is a financial decision. There are conflicting theories regarding impact of dividend decision
on the valuation of a firm. For the sake of convenience, these theories can be grouped into the following two
categories:




1. IRRELEVANT CONCEPT OF DIVIDEND

 MODIGLIANI AND MILLER’S APPROACH (M-M MODEL)
According to this theory, dividend decision is irrelevant so far as the valuation of the firm is concerned. The
major argument indicating that dividends are irrelevant to the value of shares and the firm was first propounded
by Franco Modigliani and Meston Miller in 1961.
According to Modigliani and Miller (M-M), dividend policy of a firm is irrelevant as it does not affect the wealth
of the shareholders. They argued that the value of the firm depends on its earning potentiality and investment
policy and not on the pattern of income distribution. Thus, when investment decision of the firm is given, dividend
decision, i.e., the split of earnings between dividends and retained earnings, is of no significance in determining
the value of the firm.
As observed by M-M, “Under conditions of perfect capital markets, rational investors, absence of tax
discrimination between dividend income and capital appreciation, given the firm’s investment policy may have
no influence on the market price of the shares.”
Assumptions of M-M Hypothesis
This hypothesis is based on the following assumptions:
    1.   The capital markets are perfect. Perfect capital markets imply that
          a)   Information is freely available to all,


                                                                                                               633
EP-CA&FM                                                                                           Dividend Decisions

            b)   Transaction and floatation costs do not exist and
            c)   No investor is large enough to affect the market price of a share.
   2.      Investors behave rationally.
   3.      There are either no taxes or there are no differences in the tax rates applicable to dividends and capital
           gains. This means that investors value a rupee of dividend as much as a rupee of capital gains.
   4.      The firm has a fixed investment policy.
   5.      Risk or uncertainty does not exist, i.e., investors are able to forecast future prices and dividends with
           certainty and one discount rate is appropriate for all securities at time periods.
Explanation of the Theory
The logic put forward by M-M in support of their hypothesis is that whatever increase in shareholders’ wealth
results from dividend payments, will be exactly offset by the decline in the market price of the shares because
of external financing and, hence, there will be no change in the total wealth of the shareholders.
External financing results in ‘increasing the number of shares’ and ‘fall in the future earnings per share’. Thus,
whatever a shareholder is benefited in as a result of increased dividends will be neutralized completely on
account of fall-in the value of shares due to decline in the expected earning per share as a result of external
financing.
According to M-M hypothesis, the market value of a share in the beginning of the period is equal to the present
value of dividends paid at the end of the period plus the market value of the share at the end of the period. This
can be identified in the form of the following formula:
                                                         D1 + P1
                                                    P0 =          and
                                                         1 + CR
                                                    P1 = P0 (1 + CR ) − D1

Where, P0 = Market price at the beginning or at the 0 period.
           P1 = Market price at the end of period 1.
           CR (or Ke) = Capitalization rate of the firm or cost of equity capital.
           D1 = Dividend per share at the end of period 1.
Illustration:
Show that the payment or non-payment of dividend does not affect the value of the firm as per MM approach
with the help of the following information:
A company belongs to a risk class for which the appropriate rate of capitalization is 10%. The total number of
equity shares is 30,000. The current market price of an equity share is Rs.80. The company is thinking to declare
a dividend of Rs.4 per share at the end of the current year. The company expects to have a net income of
Rs.3,00,000. It has proposal of making investment of Rs.6,00,000 in new proposals. If MM approach is adopted,
show that payment or non-payment of dividend does not affect the value of equity shares of the company.

Illustration:
Ram Company belongs to a risk class for which the appropriate capitalization rate is 12%. It currently has
outstanding 30000 shares selling at Rs. 100 each. The firm is contemplating the declaration of dividend of Rs.
6 per share at the end of the current financial year. The company expects to have a net income of Rs. 3,00,000
and a proposal for making new investments of Rs. 6,00,000. Show that under the MM assumptions, the payment
of dividend does not affect the value of the firm. How many new shares issued and what is the market value at
the end of the year?
Solution

           (D1 + P1 )
P0 =
             1+ ke
P0 = market price per share at 0 time
ke = capitalisation rate for firm in that risk class (assumed constant throughout)
D1 = dividend per share at time 1
P1 = market price per share at time 1. In the given problem
Po = 100
D1 = r 6
P1 =?
ke = 12%

           (D1 + P1 )
P0 =
             1+ ke
= 100(1.12) = 6 + P1
OR
6 + P1 = 112
P1 = 112 – 6

Illustration:
Z Ltd. has 1,000 share at $100 per share. The company is contemplating a $10 per share dividend at the end of
the year. It expects a net income of $25,000.
Required: Calculate the company’s share price under the following conditions:
     l     Dividend declared
     l     Dividend not declared
Also, assuming that the company pays dividends and makes a new investment of $48,000 in the coming period,
how many new shares will need to be issued to the Finance Investment Programme (as per the MM) approach
with a 20% risk factor?
Solution:
The price of share can be expressed as follows:
P1 = P0 (1 + k) - D1


                                                                                                               637

When a dividend is not paid:
P1 = $100 (1 + 10) - 0
= 100 x 1.10
=$110
When a dividend is paid:
P1 = 100 (1 + .10) - 10
= $100
New shares:
M x P1 = i - (X - ND1)
M x 100 = 48,000 - (25,000 - 10,000)
110M = 33,000
M = 33,000 / 100
M = 330 shares
Criticism of M-M Hypothesis
M-M hypothesis of dividend irrelevance is based on unrealistic assumptions, the most critical of which are as
follows:
1. Perfect Capital Market:
Perfect capital market does not exist in reality. Information about the company is not available to all persons.
2. Tax Differential:
Taxes do exist and there are different rates of tax for capital gains and dividends. Capital gains are subject to
lower tax rate compared to dividends. Hence, cost of internal financing will be cheaper than external financing.
So, the shareholders would favor retention of earnings on account of tax differential.
3. Floatation Cost:
The firms have to incur floatation costs while raising funds from outside. Hence, external financing will be
costlier than internal financing.
4. Transaction Costs:
The shareholders have to pay brokerage fee etc. on selling their shares. Moreover, it is inconvenient also to sell
shares. Hence, shareholders would prefer to have dividend as compared to capital gains.
5. Uncertainty:
There is always uncertainty in the capital market. Hence, shareholders prefer present dividends to future
dividends. Hence, the value of shares of that company would be higher than that of company which is following
the policy of retention of earnings.
6. Rigid Investment Policy:
The firms do not follow a rigid investment policy.
All the above discussion proves that dividend decision is very relevant in affecting the value of firm and shares.

2. RELEVANCE CONCEPT OF DIVIDEND

 WALTER’S APPROACH:
Prof. Walter’s approach supports the doctrine that dividend decisions are relevant and affect the value of the
firm. The relationship between the internal rate of return earned by the firm and its cost of capital is very
significant in determining the dividend policy to sub serve the ultimate goal of maximizing the wealth of the
shareholders.
Prof Walter’s model is based on the relationship between the firms’:
    (i)   Return on investment, i.e., r, and
   (ii)   The cost of capital or the required rate of return, i.e., k.
According to Prof Walter, there are three types of firms as given below:
1) Growth Firm (When r > k):
If the firm earns a higher rate of return in its investment than the required rate of return, the firm should retain
the earnings. Such firms are termed as growth firms and the optimum pay-out would be zero in their case. This
would maximize the value of shares.
2) Declining Firm (When r < k):
In case of declining firms which do not have profitable investments, the shareholders would stand to gain if the
firm distributes its earnings. For such firms, the optimum pay-out would be 100% and the firms should distribute
the entire earnings as dividends.
3) Normal Firm (When r = K):
In case of normal firm the dividend policy will not affect the market value of shares as the shareholders will get
the same return from the firm as expected by them. For such firms, there is no optimum dividend payout and
the value of the firm would not change with the change in dividend rate.
Walter’s model is based on the following assumptions:
   a)     Internal financing:
		 The firm finances all investment through retained earnings; that is debt or new equity is not issued.
   b)     Constant return and cost of capital:
		 The firm’s rate of return, r, and its cost of capital, k is constant.
   c)     100 percent payout or retention:
		 All earnings are either distributed as dividends or reinvested internally immediately.
   d)     Constant EPS and DPS:
Beginning earnings and dividends never change. The value of the earnings per share, EPS, and the dividend
        per share, DPS, may be changed in the model to determine results, but any given values of EPS or DPS
        are assumed to remain constant forever in determining a given value.
   e)     Infinite time:
The firm has a very long or infinite life.

WALTER’S FORMULA FOR DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A SHARE
Prof. Walter has given the following formula to ascertain the market price of a share:
                                                                R 
                                                      P = D +  (E − D )
                                                      P=        Ke 
                                                                Ke

Where, P = market price per share
D = dividend per share
r = internal rate of return
E = earnings per share
ke = cost of equity capitalization rate.
Criticism of Walter’s Model
Walter’s model has been criticized on account of various assumptions made by Prof. Walter in formulating his
hypothesis:
   a)    The basic assumption that investments are financed through retained earnings only is seldom true in
         real world. Firms do raise funds by external financing.
   b)    The internal rate of return, i.e., r, also does not remain constant. As a matter of fact, with increased
         investment the rate of return also changes.
    c)   The assumption that cost of capital (k) will remain constant also does not hold good. As a firm’s risk
         pattern does not remain constant, it is not proper to assume that k will always remain constant.
   d)    The formula does not consider all the factors affecting dividend policy and share price. It ignores such
         factors as taxation, various legal obligations etc., Moreover, determination of market capitalization rate
         is difficult.
Illustration:
The earnings per share of a company are Rs.16. The market rate of discount (capitalization rate) to the company
is 12.5%. Retained earnings can be employed to yield a return of 10%. The company is considering a payout of
25%, 50% and 75%. Which of these would maximize the wealth of shareholders?
Solution:
Wealth of shareholders will be maximized only when the market value of the share is maximized. For finding
out the impact of the payout on market price per share, we have to use Walter’s formula which is as follows:
                                                                  Ra
                                                           D+        ( E – D)
                                                                  Rc

                                                                    Rc

   =
Where, Vc ?,=Ra 10% or .10,=Rc 12.5% or .125

			                           E = Rs.16 and
			                           D = (i) 25% of Rs.16, i.e., Rs.4
			                           (ii) 50% of Rs.16, i.e., Rs.8 and
			                           (iii) 75% of Rs.16, i.e., Rs.12 per share.

 GORDON’S APPROACH
Myron Gordon has also been a proponent of relevance concept of dividends. He has developed a model
explicitly for the valuation of equity shares based on the relationship of dividend policy and market value of the
firm. His model is based on the following assumptions:
    1)   The firm is an all equity firm.
    2)   No external financing is available. Only retained earnings will be used to financing expansion.
    3)   The internal rate of return is constant.
    4)   The cost of capital (or discount rate) for the firm remains constant and it is greater than the grow rate,
         i.e., CR > br (or g).
    5)   The retention ratio, b, once decided upon, is constant.
    6)   The firm and its stream of earnings are perpetual. Thus, the growth rate, g = br, is constant for ever.
    7)   The corporate taxes do not exist.
According to Gordon, the market value of a share is equal to the present value of an infinite stream of dividends
to be received by the shareholders on that share.
However, the dividend per share is expected to grow when earnings are retained and it is equal to payout ratio,
(1 - b), times earnings, i.e., D = E (1 – b), where b is the retention ratio. The retained earnings are assumed to be
reinvested within the all equity firm at a rate of return of r. This allows earnings to grow at the rate of g = br per
period. When we incorporate growth in earnings and dividend, resulting from retained earnings, in the dividend-
capitalization model, the present value of a share will be determined by the following formula:
                                                            E (1 – b )          D
                                           Ve   or   P0 =                or
                                                            CR – br           CR – g

Where, Ve = Price of equity share
          E = Earnings per share
          b = Retention Ratio or percentage of earnings retained
          1 – b = D/P Ratio, i.e., percentage of earnings distributed as dividends
          CR or Ke = Capitalization rate of the firm or Cost of equity capital
          br = Growth rate in r = g, i.e., rate of return on investment on an all-equity firm
          D = Dividend per share
The implications of Gordon’s model are as follows:
    1)   In the case of a growth firm where r > CR, the price per share increases as the dividend payout ratio
         decreases. Thus, such firms should retain maximum earnings.

                                                                                                                 643

   2)    In the case of a declining form where r < CR, the price per share increases as the dividend payout ratio
         increases. Thus, the shareholders of such firm stand to gain if the firm distributes its earnings. For such
         firm, optimum payout would be 100%.
    3)   In the case of a normal firm, where r = CR, the price per share remains unchanged and is not affected
         by dividend policy. For such firm, dividend policy is irrelevant and hence there is no optimum dividend
         payout.
Illustration:
The following information is available in respect of the rate of return on investment, the cost of capital and
earning per share of Arora Ltd.
         Rate of return on investment (r) = (i) 15%; (ii) 12%; and (iii) 10%
         Cost of Capital (CR) = 12%
         Earning per share (E) = Rs.10
Determine the value of its shares using Gordon’s Model assuming the following:

                                     D/p Ratio (1 – b)                 Retention Ratio (b)

 GORDON’S REVISED MODEL
Gordon revised his basic model to consider risk and uncertainty. He suggested that even when rate of return
is equal to cost of capital, dividend policy affects the value of the shares on account of uncertainty of future,
shareholders, discount distant dividends (capital gains) at a higher rate than they discount near dividends.
The crux of Gordon’s arguments is a two-fold assumption:
    (i)   Investors are risk averse, and
   (ii)   They put a premium on a certain return and discount/penalize uncertain returns.
Hence, to avoid risk, the shareholders prefer near dividends than future ones. The logic underlying the dividend
effect on the share value can be described as the bird-in-the hand argument as put forward by Gordon, thus
contents that the dividend decision has a bearing on the market price of share. The market price of the share is
favorably affected with more dividends.
Thus, in the context of uncertainty, the cost of capital (i.e., discount rate) can not be assumed to be constant.
In fact, it increases with uncertainty. In other words, the appropriate discount rate would increase with the
retention rate. The distant dividends would be discounted at a higher rate than near dividends. As the discount
rate increases with length of time, a low dividend payment in the beginning will tend to lower the value of
share in future. Hence, increasing the retention rate has the effect of raising the average discount rate, CR. and,
therefore, the firm should set a high dividend payout ratio and offer a high dividend yield in order to minimize
its cost of capital.
Thus, incorporating uncertainty into his model, Gordon concludes that dividends policy affects the value of the
share. His revised model justifies the behavior of investors who
    (i)   are risk averters and
   (ii)   Value a rupee of dividend income more than a rupee of capital gains income.
However, all do not agree with his views. For finding dividend rate at future period, the following formula is used:
			                       D1 = D0 (1 + g)t
          where, D1 = Dividend rate at given future time period
			                       D0 = Dividend at period 0
			                       g = Growth rate
			                       t = Time period
For calculating market price of a share at some distant future, the following formula is applied:
                                                    D0 (1 + g )        D1
                                             P1 =                 =
                                                     CR – g           CR – g

          where, Pi = Market price per share (ex-dividend)
			                       D0 = Current year dividend
			                       g = Constant annual growth rate of dividends
			                       CR (or Ke) = Cost of Equity Capital (or Expected Rate of Return)
			                       D1 = Dividend at the end of year

rate is expected to fall to 5%. The dividend paid last year was Rs.2. The investor desires a 12% return. You are
required to find the value of this stock.

PV Factor @ 12% is as under:

Year		1		2		3

Value		0.893		0.797		0.712

Solution:
Value of dividend at period Dt = D0 ( 1 + g)t

         D0 = Dividend of last year (Rs.2 given)
         D1 = Dividend of 1st year

         D2 = Dividend of 2nd year

         D3 = Dividend of 3rd year

         g = Growth rate

         CR = Expected Rate of Return

         D1 = D0 (1 + g) = 2 (1 + 0.25) = Rs.2.50

         D2 = D1 (1 + g) = 2.50 (1 + 0.25) = Rs.3.125

         D3 = D2 (1 + g) = 3.125 (1 + 0.05) = Rs.3.281
                                                 D3         3.281     3.281
Price of Stock at the end of second year =             =            =       = Rs.46.86
                                                CR – g   0.12 – 0.05 0.07

                                              LESSON ROUND-UP

   l Dividend policy determines what portion of earnings will be paid out to stockholders and what portion
       will be retained in the business to finance long term growth.
   l The amount of dividend payout fluctuates from period to period in keeping with fluctuations in the
       amount of acceptable investment opportunities available to the firm. if the opportunities abound,
       percentage of payout is likely to be zero; on the other hand, if the firm is unable to find out profitable
       investment opportunities, payout will be 100 per cent.
   l Walter’s model: prices reflect the present value of expected dividend in the long run. a firm is able to
       earn a higher return on earnings retained than the stockholder is able to earn on a like investment then
       it would appear beneficial to retain these earnings all other things being equal.
   l Modigliani Miller Approach: According to MM, the discounted value per share before and after a
       dividend payment will be same as if earnings had been retained
   l Dividend Policy is determined by the Board of Directors having taken into consideration a number of
       factors which include legal restrictions imported by the Government to safeguard the interest of various
       parties or the constituents of the company.
   l An appropriate dividend policy must be evaluated in the light of the objectives of the firm.

   l A stock split is a decision by a company’s board of directors to increase the number of shares
       outstanding by issuing more shares to current shareholders.
   l A stock buyback occurs when a company buys back its shares from the marketplace with its
       accumulated cash it also known as a share repurchase.


                                                  GLOSSARY

 Cash Dividend: Cash dividends are the most common and popular form of dividend payouts. The company
 issues a dividend to all shareholders. The cash dividend amount is deposited into the bank account of the
 shareholder as per their shareholding.
 Stock Dividend: Through stock dividend payouts, a company issues additional shares to its common
 shareholders without any consideration.
 Scrip Dividend: In a scenario where the company does not have enough dividends, it may issue a promissory
 note. A promissory note that is indicating to pay dividends at a later date. Essentially, this creates note
 payables for the company.
 Stable Dividend Policy: A stable dividend policy involves fixing a certain amount of dividend that the
 shareholders periodically receive. Even if the company incurs a loss, the amount of dividend does not
 change.
 Regular Dividend Policy: In a regular dividend policy, the company fixes a certain percentage of dividend
 from the company’s profits. When the profits are high, the dividend payment will automatically be high.
 While the profits are low, the dividend payment will remain low. Experts usually considers this to be the most
 appropriate policy for paying dividends and creating goodwill.
 Interim Dividend: An interim dividend is a dividend payment during a fiscal year to the shareholders. In other
 words, it is the payment of dividends before the annual audit of financial statements.

 INTRODUCTION
Capital required for a business can be classified under two main categories viz. Fixed Capital and Working
Capital. Every business needs funds for two purposes – for its establishment and to carry out its day to day
operations.
Long term funds are required to create production facilities through purchase of fixed assets such as plant,
machine, land, building, furniture etc. Investment in these assets represents that part of the firm’s capital which
is blocked on a permanent or fixed basis and is called fixed capital. Funds are also needed for short-term
purposes for the purchases of raw material, payment of wages, other day to day expenses etc. These funds are
known as working capital.
In Simple Words: Working capital refers to that part of the firm’s capital which is required for financing short-
term or current assets such as- cash, marketable securities, debtors’ and inventories funds. Thus investments
in current assets keep revolving and are being constantly converted in to cash and this cash flow out again
in exchange for other current assets. Hence, it is also known as revolving or circulating capital or short term
capital.
In the words of Shubin: “Working Capital is the amount of funds necessary to cover the cost of operating the
enterprise”.
According to Genestenberg: “Circulating capital means current assets of a company that are changed in the
ordinary course of business from one to another.”
Working capital is needed for the following purposes —
      1.   For the purchase of raw materials, components and spares.
   2.      To pay wages and salaries
   3.      To incur day to day expenses and overhead costs such as fuel, power, office experiences etc.
   4.      To meet the selling cost as – Packing, Advertising etc.
   5.      To provide credit facilities to the customers
   6.      To maintain the inventories of raw material, work in progress, stores and spares and finished stock.

 TYPES OF WORKING CAPITAL
Working capital can be classified either on the basis of Balance Sheet concept or on the basis of periodicity
(Time) of its requirements.

Working Capital Management                                                                            LESSON 17

1) On the Basis of Balance Sheet Concept:
On the basis of B/S concept, it may be either gross working capital or net working capital. Gross working capital
is represented by the total current assets. The net working capital is the excess of current assets over current
liabilities.

   a)   Gross Working Capital = Total Currents Assets (CA)

   b)   Net Working Capital = Current Assets – Current Liabilities

2) On the basis of Requirement:
According to Gerstenbergh, the working capital can be classified into two categories on the basis of time and
requirement:

   a)   Permanent Working Capital:

		 It refers to the minimum amount of investment which should always be there in fixed or minimum current
   assets like inventory, accounts receivable, or cash balance etc., in order to carry out business smoothly.
   This investment is of a regular or permanent type and as the size of the firm expands, the requirement
   of permanent working capital also increases. Tondon Committee has referred to this type of working
   capital as “hard core working capital”.

   b)   Variable Working Capital:

		 The excess of the amount of working capital over permanent working capital is known as variable
   working capital. The amount of such working capital keeps on fluctuating from time to time on variations
   in business activities. It may again be sub-divided into seasonal and special working capital. Seasonal
   working capital is required to meet the seasonal demands of busy periods occurring at stated intervals.
   On the other hand, special working capital is required to meet extraordinary needs for contingencies.
   Events like strike, fire, unexpected competition, rising price tendencies or initiating a big advertisement
   campaign require such capital.

The following diagram illustrates the difference between permanent and variable working capital:




                                                                                                             655

The above is the case of a static company and in case of growing company permanent working capital
requirement will be increasing as is shown in the figure given below:




 IMPORTANCE OR ADVANTAGES OF WORKING CAPITAL
Working capital is the lifeblood and nerve center of a business. Just as circulation of blood is essential in the
human body for maintaining life, working capital is very essential to maintain the smooth running of a business.
No business can run successfully without an adequate amount of working capital. The main advantages of
maintaining adequate amount of working capital are as follows:
      1.   Solvency of the Business:
		 Adequate working capital helps in maintaining solvency of the business by providing uninterrupted
   flow of production.
   2.      Goodwill:
		 Sufficient working capital enables a business concern to make prompt payments and hence helps in
   creating and maintaining goodwill.
   3.      Easy Loan:
		 A concern having adequate working capital, high solvency and good credit standing can arrange loans
   from banks and others on easy and favorable terms.
   4.      Cash Discounts:
		 Adequate working capital also enables a concern to avail cash discounts on the purchases and hence
   it reduces costs.
   5.      Regular Supply of Raw Material:
		 Sufficient working capital ensures regular supply of raw materials and continuous production.
   6.      Regular Payment of Salaries, Wages and Day to Day Commitments:
		 A company which has ample working capital can make regular payment of salaries, wages and other
   day-to-day commitments which raises the morale of its employees, increases their efficiency, reduces
   wastages and costs and enhances production and profits.

   7.   Exploitation of Favorable Market Conditions:
		 Only concerns with adequate working capital can exploit favorable market conditions such as
   purchasing its requirements in bulk when the prices are lower and by holding its inventories for higher
   prices.
   8.   Ability to Face Crisis:
		 Adequate working capital enables a concern to face business crisis in emergencies such as depression
   because during such periods, generally, there is much pressure on working capital.
   9.   Quick and Regular Return on Investments:
		 Every investor wants a quick and regular return on his investments. Sufficiency of working capital
   enables a concern to pay quick and regular dividends to its investors, as there may not be much
   pressure to plough back profits. This gains the confidence of its investors and creates a favorable
   market to raise additional funds in the future.
  10.   High Morale:
		 Adequacy of working capital creates an environment of security, confidence, high morale and creates
   overall efficiency in a business.

 FACTORS DETERMINING THE WORKING CAPITAL
The working capital requirement may be calculated with following determinants:
   1.   Nature of Business:
		 The working capital requirements of a firm basically depend upon the nature of its business. Public
   utility undertakings like Electricity, Water Supply and Railways need very limited working capital
   because they offer cash sales only and supply services, not products, and as such no funds are tied up
   in inventories and receivables. On the other hand trading and financial firms require less investment in
   fixed assets but have to invest large amounts in current assets like inventories, receivables and cash;
   as such they need large amount of working capital.
   2.   Size of Business/Scale of Operations:
		 The working capital requirements of a concern are directly influenced by the size of its business which
   may be measured in terms of scale of operations. Greater the size of a business unit, generally larger
   will be the requirements of working capital.
   3.   Manufacturing Process/Length of Production Cycle:
		 In manufacturing business, the requirements of working capital increase in direct proportion to length
   of manufacturing process. Longer the process period of manufacturing, larger is the amount of working
   capital required.
   4.   Seasonal Variations:
		 In certain industries raw material is not available throughout the year. They have to buy raw materials
   in bulk during the season to ensure an uninterrupted flow and process during the entire year.
   5.   Working Capital Cycle or Operating Cycle:
		 In a manufacturing concern, the working capital cycle starts with the purchase of raw material and
   ends with the realization of cash from the sale of finished products. This cycle involves purchase of
   raw materials and stores, its conversion into stocks of finished goods through work-in-progress with


                                                                                                       657
EP-CA&FM                                                                              Working Capital Management

           progressive increment of labour and service costs, conversion of finished stock into sales, debtors and
           receivables and ultimately realization or cash and this cycle continues again from cash to purchase of
           raw material and so on.




		
		 The speed with which the working capital completes one cycle determines the requirement of working
   capital-longer the period of the cycle larger is the requirement of working capital.
   6.      Rate of Stock Turnover:
		 There is a high degree of inverse co-relationship between the quantum of working capital and the
   velocity or speed with which the sales are effected. A firm having a high rate of stock turnover will need
   lower amount of working capital as compared to a firm having a low rate of turnover.
      7.   Firm’s Credit Policy:
		 The credit policy of a concern in its dealings with debtors and creditors influences considerably the
   requirements of working capital. A concern that purchases its requirements on credit and sells its
   products/services on cash requires lesser amount of working capital. On the other hand a concern
   buying its requirements for cash and allowing credit to its customers, shall need larger amount of working
   capital as very huge amounts of funds are bound to be blocked up in debtors or bills receivables.
   8.      Business Cycles:
		 Business cycle refers to alternate expansion and contraction in general business activity. In a period
   of boom i.e., when the business is prosperous, there is a need for larger amount of working capital due
   to increase in sales, rise in prices, optimistic expansion of business, etc. On the contrary, in the times of
   depression i.e. when there is a downswing of the cycle, the business contracts sales decline, difficulties
   are faced in collections from debtors, and firms may have a large amount of working capital lying idle.
   9.      Rate of Growth of Business:
		 The working capital requirements of a concern increase with the growth and expansion of its business
   activities. Although, it is difficult to determine the relationship between the growth in the volume of
   business and the growth in the working capital of a business, yet it may be concluded that for normal
   rate of expansion in the volume of business, we may have retained profits to provide for more working
   capital. But in fast growing concerns, we shall require larger amount of working capital.
  10.      Earning Capacity and Dividend Policy:
		 Some firms have more earning capacity than others due to quality of their products, monopoly
   conditions, etc. Such firms with high earning capacity may generate cash profits from operations and

         contribute to their working capital. The dividend policy of a concern also influences the requirements of
         its working capital.
   11.   Other Factors:
		       In addition to the above considerations, there are a number of other factors which affect the requirements
         of working capital. Such as operating efficiency, management ability, irregularities to supply, import
         policy, asset structure, political stability, importance of labour banking facilities, etc., also influence the
         requirements of working capital.

 THE CONCEPT OF NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL
Negative Working capital is a situation in which current liabilities of the company are higher than current assets.
Generally negative working capital is a sign that the company may be facing bankruptcy or a serious financial
trouble. Under the best circumstances, poor working capital leads to financial pressure on a company, increased
borrowing, and late payments to creditor - all of which result in a lower credit rating. A lower credit rating means
banks charge a higher interest rate, which can cost a corporation a lot of money over time. Companies with
negative working capital may lack the funds necessary for growth.
Another situation is where companies can sell their inventory and generate cash so quickly that they actually have
a negative working capital. These are companies which takes advance first against supply of goods or services.
McDonald’s had a negative working capital of $698.5 million between 1999 and 2000). Amazon.com is another
example. This happens because customers pay upfront and so rapidly that the business has no problems
raising cash. In these companies, products are delivered and sold to the customer before the company even
pays for them.
In order to understand how a company can have a negative working capital, let us take an example of Wal-
Mart. Suppose Wal-Mart orders 500,000 copies of a DVD to Warner Brothers and they were supposed to pay
within 30 days. What if by the sixth or seventh day, Wal-Mart had already put the DVDs on the shelves of its
stores across the country? By the twentieth day, they may have sold all of the DVDs. Here, Wal-Mart received
the DVDs, shipped them to its stores, and sold them to the customer (making a profit in the process), all before
they had paid Warner Brothers! If Wal-Mart can continue to do this with all of its suppliers, it doesn’t really need
to have enough cash on hand to pay all of its accounts payable. As long as the transactions are timed right,
they can pay each bill as it comes due, maximizing their efficiency.
The bottom line is that a negative working capital can also be a sign of managerial efficiency in a business with
low inventory and accounts receivable (which means they operate on an almost strictly cash basis).
For detail analysis on negative working capital students can refer the case study:
“Negative working capital and its impact on profitability: A Case Study of HUL”, The Management Accountant,
March-2013, pp. 308-313 https://icmai.in/Knowledge-Bank/upload/case-study/2013/Negative-Working.pdf

 MANAGEMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL
Working capital, in general practice, refers to the excess of current assets over current liabilities. Management
of working capital, therefore, is concerned with the problems that arise in attempting to manage the current
assets, the current liabilities and the inter-relationship that exists between them. In other words, it refers to all
aspects of administration of both current assets and current liabilities.
The basic goal of working capital management is to manage the current assets and current liabilities of a firm in
such a way that a satisfactory level of working capital is maintained, i.e., it is neither inadequate nor excessive.
This is so because inadequate as well as excessive working capital positions are bad for any business.
Inadequacy of working capital may lead the firm to insolvency and excessive working capital implies idle funds
which earn no profits for the business.

                                                                                                                   659
EP-CA&FM                                                                                    Working Capital Management

Working capital management policies of a firm have a great effect on its profitability, liquidity and structural
health of the organization. In this context, working capital management is three dimensional in nature:
      (i)   Dimension I, is concerned with the formulation of policies with regard to profitability, risk and liquidity.
   (ii)     Dimension II is concerned with the decisions about the composition and level of current assets.
  (iii)     Dimension III is concerned with the decisions about the composition and level of current liabilities.




 ESTIMATION OF WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENT
The most difficult problem that is faced by the finance manager is the determination of the amount of working
capital required at a particular level of production. Following methods are used to estimate working capital
requirement:
      l     Percentage (%) on Sales Method
      l     Regression Analysis Method
      l     Forecasting Net Current Assets Method
      l     Projected Balance Sheet Method
      l     Operating Cycle Method

 Percentage (%) on Sales Method:
It is a traditional and simple method of determining the level of working capital and its components. Under this
method, the relationship between sales and working capital is set over the years. As the sales of previous year
is assumed base as 100% and all current assets and current liabilities of previous year are termed in proportion
of sales percentage and on the basis of expected sales of future sales, the current assets and current liabilities
will be calculated.
This method is simple, easy to understand and useful for projecting relatively short-term changes in working
capital. However, this method cannot be recommended for universal application because the assumption of
linear relationship between sales and working capital may not hold good in all cases.

 Regression Analysis Method:
This is statistical method or technique which is applied to forecast working capital requirement. It is a useful
statistical technique applied for forecasting working capital requirements. It helps in making working capital
requirement projections after establishing the average relationship between sales and working capital and its
various components in the past years. The method of least squares is used in this regard.
The relationship between sales and working capital is given by the equation:
Y = a + bx
Where,
x = Sales (independent variable)
y = Working capital level (dependent variable)
a = Intercept of the least square line with vertical axis
b = Slope of the line
The value of ‘a’ and ‘b’ are obtained by the solution of simultaneous linear equations given below:
Σy = na + bΣx
Σxy = aΣx + bΣx2

Solution:

   Formula = Σy = na + bΣx                                Formula = Σxy = aΣx + bΣx2
   Will replace the formula with values we have           Will replace the formula with values we have
   1029 = 10a + 1642b                                     185620 = 1642a + 292802b
   Multiply by 1642                                       Multiply by 10
   => 1689618 = 16420a + 2696164 ———– Eq. (1)             => 1856200 = 16420a + 2928020b ———– Eq. (2)


  Subtract Eq. (1) from (2), we get,
  166582 = 0 + 231856 b
  b = 166582/231856 = 0.7185
  Now, replace b = 0.7185 in our old eq. 1029 = 10a + 1642b
  We get, a = -15. 078

Working Capital (x) = -15.078 + 0.7185 Sales (b)
Now, if the forecasted sales for the year 2025 are 300 crore, the working capital as per this method would be
200.472 crore. (Working Capital = -15.078 + 0.7185 * 300 = 200.472).

 Forecasting Net Current Assets Method:
This is a very much popular method of computing working capital requirement. Under this method, all forecasted
current assets and current liabilities are computed first then identify the net current assets (Total current assets
– Total current liabilities). We may have few examples in form of illustrations for this method as follows:

Illustration-3:
From the following information, prepare a statement showing the average amount of working capital required
by Solvent Ltd., taking 360 days in a year.
Annual sales are estimated at 5,00,000 units at Rs.2 per unit. Production quantities coincide with sales and will
be carried on evenly throughout the year and the production cost is:
Materials		                  Re. 1 per unit
Labour			                    Re. 0.40 per unit
Overheads		                  Re. 0.35 per unit
Customers are given 45 days’ credit and 60 days’ credit is taken from suppliers – 36 days’ supply of raw
materials and 15 days’ supply of finished goods are kept.
Production cycle is 18 days and all material is issued at the commencement of each production cycle.
A cash balance equivalent to one-third of the average of other working capital requirement is kept for contingencies.

Note:
    (i)   Debtors have been taken at total cost of sales. Alternatively, they may be taken at selling price.
   (ii)   It has been assumed that labour and overheads are incurred evenly through out the production process.

 Projected Balance Sheet Method:
Under this method, all estimated assets and liabilities are taken in consideration in form of Balance Sheet
(excluding cash as it is to be calculated) with their forecasted figures. The balance of Liabilities over Assets will
be the Cash, whereas the balance of assets over liabilities will be bank Overdraft.
We may understand the concept with the following illustration:

Illustration-4:
On 1st January, 2006, the board of directors of Littlemore & Co. desire to know the amount of working capital
that will be required to meet the programme they have planned for the year. From the following information,
prepare an estimate of working capital requirements and a forecast of Profit and Loss Account and Balance
Sheet.
Issued Shared Capital                  Rs. 2,00,000
8% Debentures                               Rs. 50,000
Fixed Assets as on 1st Jan.            Rs. 1,25,000
Production during the previous year was 60,000 units and it proposed to maintain the same during 2006.
The expected ratios of cost to selling price are: raw materials 60%, direct wages 10%, and overheads 20%.
Following further information are available:
    1)    Raw materials are expected to remain in stores for an average of two months before issue to production.
   2)     Each unit of production is expected to be in process for one month.
   3)     Finished goods will stay in the warehouse awaiting dispatch to customers for approximately three
          months.
   4)     Credit allowed by creditors is two months from date of delivery of raw materials.
   5)     Credit given to debtors is three months from date of dispatch.
   6)     Selling price is Rs.5 per unit.
   7)     Sales and production follow a consistent pattern.

 THE OPERATIONAL CYCLE METHOD CONCEPT AND APPLICATION OF QUANTITATIVE
 TECHNIQUES
This method of working capital forecast is based on the operational cycle concept of working capital. The
operational cycle refers to the period that a business enterprise takes in converting cash back into cash. In
the case of a manufacturing concern, the duration of time needed to complete the chain of events from cash
to production and back to cash is termed as the “operating cycle”. As an example, a manufacturing firm uses
cash to acquire inventory of materials that is converted into semi-finished goods and then into finished goods.
When finished goods are disposed of to customers, no credit accounts receivable are generated. When cash is
collected from customers, we again have cash. At this stage one operating cycle is completed.
Thus, a circle from cash back to cash is called the ‘Operating Cycle’. Each of the above operating cycle stage
is expressed in terms of number of days of relevant activity and requires a level of investment to support it. The
sum total of these stage-wise investments will be the total amount of working capital of the firm.
The following formula may be used to express the framework of the operating cycle:
                                               t = (r – c) + w + f + b
where,    t=    stands for the total period of the operating cycle in number of days;
          r    stands for the number of days of raw material and stores consumption requirements held in raw
               materials and stores inventory


                                                                                                               667
EP-CA&FM                                                                            Working Capital Management

          c    stands for the number of days of purchases in trade creditors;
          w    stands for the number of days of cost of production held in work-in-progress;
          f    stands for the number of days of cost of sales held in finished goods inventory;
          b    stands for the number of days of sales in book debts.
The computations may be made as under:
                                   Average inventory of raw materials and stores
                         r=

                                                  Average sales per day

The average inventory, trade creditors, work-in-progress, finished goods and book debts can be computed by
adding the opening and closing balances at the end of the year in the respective accounts and dividing the
same by two. The average per day figures can be obtained by dividing the concerned annual figures by 365 or
the number of days in the given period.
The operational cycle method of determining working capital requirements gives only an average figure.
The fluctuations in the intervening period due to seasonal or other factors and their impact on the working
capital requirements can not be judged in this method. To identify these impacts, continuous short-run detailed
forecasting and budgeting exercises are necessary.

 MANAGEMENT OF CASH
Cash is one of the current assets of a business. It is needed at all times to keep the business going. A business
concern should always keep sufficient cash for meeting its obligations. Any shortage of cash will hamper the
operation of a concern and any excess of it will be unproductive. Cash is the most unproductive of all the assets.
While fixed assets like machinery, plant, etc. and current assets such as inventory will help the business in
increasing its earning capacity, cash in hand will not add anything to the concern.

 Nature of Cash
For some persons, cash means only money in the form of currency (cash in hand). For other persons, cash
means both cash in hand and cash at bank. Some even include near cash assets in it. They take marketable
securities too as part of cash. These are the securities which can easily be converted into cash.
Cash itself does not produce goods or services. It is used as a medium to acquire other assets. It is the other
assets which are used in manufacturing goods or providing services. The idle cash can be deposited in bank to
earn interest.

 Motives for holding Cash
      1)   Transaction Motive:
		 A firm needs cash for making transactions in the day to day operations. The cash is needed to make
   purchases, pay expenses, taxes, dividends, etc. The need to hold cash would not arise if there were
   perfect synchronization between cash receipts and cash payment, i.e., enough cash is received when
   the payment has to be made.
   2)      Precautionary Motive:
		 A firm is required to keep cash for meeting various contingencies. Though cash inflows and cash

670
Working Capital Management                                                                            LESSON 17

        outflows are anticipated, there may be variations in these estimates. For example, a debtor who was to
        pay after 7 days may inform of his inability to pay; on the other hand a supplier who used to give credit
        for 15 days may not have the stock to supply or he may not be in a position to give credit at present. In
        these situations cash receipts will be less than expected and cash payments will be more as purchases
        may have to be made for cash instead of credit. Such contingencies often arise in a business. A firm
        should keep some cash for such contingencies or it should be in position to raise finances at a short
        period. The cash maintained for contingency needs is not productive or it remains idle. However, such
        cash may be invested in short-period or low-risk marketable securities which may provide cash as and
        when necessary.
   3)   Speculative Motive:
		 The speculative motive relates to holding of cash for investing in profitable opportunities as and
   when they arise. Such opportunities do not come in a regular manner. These opportunities cannot
   be scientifically predicted but only conjectures can be made about their occurrence. For example,
   the prices of shares and securities may be low at a time with an expectation that these will go up
   shortly. The prices of raw materials may fall temporarily and a firm may like to make purchases at
   these prices. Such opportunities can be availed of if a firm has cash balance with it. These transactions
   are speculative because prices may not move in a direction; in which we suppose them to move. The
   primary motive of a firm is not to indulge in speculative transactions but such investment may be made
   at times.

 FACTORS DETERMINING LEVEL OF CASH
Maintenance of optimum level of cash is the main problem around which the financial managers do the exercise
of cash managements. Level of cash holding differs from industry to industry, organization to organization but
the factors determining its level are common to all which can be summarized as follows:
   1)   Credit Policy:
		 Credit policy refers to the management policy in regard to allowing credit sales. It affects productivity
   and liquidity of the business considerably. If credit policy is liberal cash level will be higher and vice-
   versa.
   2)   Nature of the Product:
		 Nature of goods produced by the organization to a great extent exercises influence on cash reserves.
   If the produce comes in necessity class, the level of cash holding will differ in comparison to luxury
   necessity.
   3)   Size and Area of Operation:
		 Area of operation refers to the geographical area in which the organization is operating. If the
   organization is working on a large scale, it is quite possible that organization would have to keep higher
   cash balance. On the contrary, limited area of operations will require less cash balance.
   4)   Duration of Production Cycle:
		 It refers to the time period taken by the raw material to become finished product/marketable produce.
   In case of long production cycle, the level of cash holding is likely to be high and vice-versa.
   5)   Policy followed by the Organization as to Disbursement of Salaries, Bonus, Dividend etc.:
		 If salaries are being distributed after 15 days the organization would have to manage a high level of
   cash reserve, while the weekly payment of wages and salaries will require still more funds. On the
   contrary, monthly payments will reduce the need of funds.

                                                                                                             671
EP-CA&FM                                                                              Working Capital Management

   6)      Relations with Banks and Credit Standing of the Firm:
		 A firm managing proper relations with banks needs to carry less cash reserves to meet unpredicted
   cash outflow. Similarly, a firm whose credit standing is high can secure its supplies of materials on most
   suitable terms and finance a considerable part of its inventory through trade credit.

 ADVANTAGES OF AMPLE CASH
The planning of cash is one of the primary responsibilities of financial management. In fact, cash is hub around
which all financial matters cluster. A firm having sufficient cash balance can drive the following advantages
from it:
      1)   Maintenance of Goodwill:
		 The goodwill and reputation of a business firm depends to a large extent on this fact that the firm retires
   all the obligations and meets the payments as and when they mature. It can be possible only when the
   firm maintains a good cash balance.
   2)      Cash Discount can be Availed:
		 If a firm has sufficient cash, it can avail cash discounts offered by the suppliers. It will lower down the
   raw material cost and finally the cost of production.
   3)      Good Bank Relations:
		 Commercial banks like to maintain good relations with such firms having high liquidity in funds. Such
   firms can avail credit facility from the banks at reasonable rate of interest.
   4)      Exploitation of Business Opportunities:
		 Firms having good cash position can exploit the business opportunities very well. They can take risk of
   entering into new ventures.
   5)      Encouragement to New Investments:
		 Firm having good cash position can maintain a sound cash dividend policy. This encourages the new
   investment in the shares of such firm because shareholders like cash dividend the most.
   6)      Increase in Efficiency:
		 Unless there is an adequate supply of cash, production can not be carried out smoothly. Uninterrupted
   production process increases labour efficiency.

 CASH MANAGEMENT MODELS
One very important objective of cash management is to determine optimal cash balance, i.e., to ensure that
cash does not remain idle unnecessarily and, at the same time, the firm is not confronted with a situation of
cash shortage. The amount of cash balance will depend on the risk-return trade off. if the firm’s cash balances
are insufficient, its liquidity position will become weak but its profitability will improve as the released funds
can be invested in marketable securities so that when the need arises, the firm can sell these to meet out its
requirement. On the other hand, if the firm keeps high balances, its liquidity position will certainly improve
but it will have to forego the potential profit on holding large cash balance. Hence, the firm should maintain
optimum-cash balance, neither too much nor too little. The problem before a financial manager is to determine
the optimum cash balance.
Various cash management models attempt to achieve the objective of cash management.

Working Capital Management                                                                                LESSON 17

A brief description of these models is as follows:
(1) Optimum Cash Balance Under Certainty - Baumol’s Mathematical Model:
Baumol’s model provides a formal approach for determining a firm’s optimum cash balance under certainty. It
is based on the combination of inventory theory with monetary theory. This model is usually used in inventory
management but has its application in determining the optimal cash balance also. In this model, cash is taken
as an inventory item which flows out at a constant rate and is replenished instantaneously by borrowing or by
selling securities. It is assumed that the size and timing of cash inflows are fully controllable to which transaction
cost (fixed cost per order, i.e., cost of converting the securities into cash) and a variable carrying cost per rupee
(in the form of opportunity cost of holding cash, i.e., the return on marketable securities) are attached. There
is inverse relationship between the two costs as when one increases, the other decreases. Hence, the optimal
cash balance is the trade off between opportunity cost and transaction cost and it is reached at a point where
total cost is least.
The optimum cash balance is shown in figure given below:




                   Baumol’s Model (Trade off between Holding Cost and Transaction Cost)
The following formula may be applied for calculating optimum cash balance:
                                                          2A × F
                                                     C=
                                                            O

where, C = Optimum cash balance
         A = Annual (or monthly) cash disbursements
         F = Fixed cost per transaction
         O = Opportunity cost of holding cash
Assumptions:
Baumol’s model is based upon the following assumptions:
   a)    Cash needs of the firm are known with certainty.
   b)    Cash disbursements are uniform over a period of time and it is known with certainty.
    c)   The opportunity cost of holding cash and transaction cost of converting securities into cash are known
         and they remain constant.
However, inside the model is subject to unreal assumptions, it does not provide an applicable tool for cash
management.

As total cost is minimum at lot size of Rs.2,00,000 and so it is economic lot size of selling securities. The company
should make 10,00,000 ÷ 2,00,000 = 5 transactions regarding sale of marketable securities for conversion into
cash during the yer.
Calculation of Economic Lot Size by Baumol Model:
                                       2A × F       2 × 10,00,000 × 1,000
                                  C=          =                           = Rs.2,00,000

(2) Optimum Cash Balance Under Uncertainty or Stochastic Model – The Miller-Orr Model:
It helps to determine the optimal level of cash balance when the demand for cash is stochastic and not known
in advance. In such a situation, Baumol’s EOQ model is not applicable. When changes in cash balances occur
randomly, the application of control theory serves a useful purpose. The Miller-Orr model is one of such control
limit models. It deals with the cash management problem under the assumption of stochastic cash flows. Thus,
this model is useful for firms with uncertain cash inflows and cash outflows. In this model, two control limits
are set for cash balances. These limits may consists of as ‘upper limit’ ‘h’, ‘z’ as the return point and ‘l’ as
the ‘lower limit’. When cash balance reaches the upper limit, a transfer of cash equal to h-z is affected to
marketable securities; when it touches the lower limit, a transfer from marketable securities to cash is made.
During the period when cash balance stays between these high and low limits, no transaction between cash
and marketable securities is made.
The high and low limits of cash balances are set on the basis of fixed costs associated with the securities transactions,

the opportunity cost of holding cash and the degree of likely fluctuation in cash balances. These limits satisfy the
demand for cash at the lowest possible total cost. The model is illustrated in the following figure:




                                      Miller-Orr Cash Management Model
We can see in the figure that when the balance reaches the upper limit, h-z amount of cash is invested in the
marketable securities and then the new cash balance comes down to z rupees. When the balance touches l, l-z
rupees of marketable securities are sold bringing the cash balance to z again. The minimum limit can be set at
some amount higher than Zero also, and then h and z would move up in the figure. Setting up the lower limit at
some positive amount would take care of delays in transfer from one account to another. The optimal value of
z, the return point for security transactions can be determined as follows:

                                                            3b σ 2

where, b = fixed cost associated with a security transaction
        σ 2 = variance of daily net cash flows

        i = interest rate per day on marketable securities.
        The optimal value of h is simply 3z.
        Upper Limit = Lower Limit + 3z
        Return Point = Lower Limit + z
         or = Upper Limit – 2z
        Average Cash Balance = Lower Limit + z.

Illustration-8:
Amit Ltd. has a policy of maintaining a minimum cash balance of Rs.5,00,000. The standard deviation of the
company’s daily cash flows is Rs.2,00,000. The annual interest rate is 14%. The transaction cost of buying or
selling securities is Rs.150 per transaction. Determine Amit’s upper control limit and return point as per Miller-Orr
Model.

 MANAGING CASH FLOWS
After estimating the cash flows, efforts should be made to adhere to the estimates of receipts and payments of
cash. Cash management will be successful only if cash collections are accelerated and cash disbursements, as
far as possible, are delayed. The following methods of cash management help in managing cash:

(A) Methods of Accelerating Cash Inflows
      1.   Prompt Payment by Customers:
		 In order to accelerate cash inflows, the collections from customers should be prompt. This will be
   possible by prompt billing. The customers should be promptly informed about the amount payable and
   the time by which it should be paid. Another method for prompting customers to pay earlier is to allow
   them a cash discount.
   2.      Quick Conversion of Payment into Cash:
		 Cash inflows can be accelerated by improving the cash collecting process. Once the customer writes a
   cheque in favor of the concern the collection can be quickened by its early collection
   3.      Decentralized Collections:
		 A big firm operating over wide geographical area can accelerate collections by using the system of
   decentralized collections. A number of collecting centers are opened in different areas instead of
   collecting receipts at one place. Decentralized collection system saves mailing and processing time
   and, thus, reduces the financial requirements.
   4.      Lock Box System:
		 Lock box system is another technique of reducing mailing, processing and collecting time. Under this
   system, the firm selects some collecting centers at different places. The places are selected on the
   basis of number of consumers and the remittances to be received from a particular place. The firm hires
   a post box in a post office and the parties are asked to send the cheques on that post box number. A
   local bank is authorized to operate the post box.

(B) Methods of Slowing Cash Outflows
A company can keep cash by effectively controlling disbursements. The objective of controlling cash outflows
is to slow down the payments as far as possible. Following methods can be used to delay disbursements:
      1.   Paying on Last Date:
		 The disbursements can be delayed on making payments on the last due date only. If the credit is for 10
   days then payment should be made on 10th day only.

   2.      Payments through Drafts:
		 A company can delay payments by issuing drafts to the suppliers instead of giving cheques. When a
   cheque is issued then the company will have to keep a balance in its account so that the cheque is paid
   whenever it comes. On the other hand a draft is payable only on presentation to the issuer. The receiver
   will give the draft to its bank for presenting it to the buyer’s bank. It takes a number of days before it is
   actually paid.
   3.      Adjusting Payroll Funds:
		 Some economy can be exercised on payroll funds also. It can be done by reducing the frequency of
   payments. It the payments are made weekly then this period can be extended to a month. Secondly,
   finance manager can plan the issuing of salary cheque and their disbursements.
   4.      Centralization of Payments:
		 The payments should be centralized and payments should be made through drafts or cheques. When
   cheques are issued from the main office then it will take time for the cheques to be cleared through
   post. The benefit of cheque collecting time is availed.
   5.      Inter-bank Transfer:
		 An efficient use of cash is also possible by inter-bank transfers. If the company has accounts with more
   than one bank then amounts can be transferred to the bank where disbursements are to be made. It
   will help in avoiding excess amount in one bank.

Calculation of wages:
Delay in wages payment is 1/8 so the balance 7/8 will be realized in the same month.
Calculation for the month of Jan:
1/8 of the month of Dec. i.e. 1/8 (2800)            =               350
7/8 of the month of Jan. i.e. 7/8 (2000)            =              1750
Total                                               =              2100
The same procedure is used for other months

 MANAGEMENT OF INVENTORY
The dictionary meaning of inventory is ‘stock of goods’. The word ‘Inventory’ is understood differently by various
authors. In accounting language it may mean stock of finished goods only. In a manufacturing concern, it may
include raw materials; work in process, stores, etc. To understand the exact meaning of the word ‘Inventory’,
we may study it from the usage side or from the side of point of entry in the operations. Inventory includes the
following things:
    a)    Raw Material 						
    b)    Work-in-Progress
    c)    Consumables 						
    d)    Finished goods
    e)    Spares
Purpose/benefits of holding inventories
There are three main purposes of motives of holding inventories:
   (i)    The Transaction Motive which facilitates continuous production and timely execution of sales orders.
   (ii)   The Precautionary Motive which necessitates the holding of inventories for meeting the unpredictable
          changes in demand and supplies of materials.
  (iii)   The Speculative Motive which induces to keep inventories for taking advantage of price fluctuations,
          saving in re-ordering costs and quantity discounts, etc.
The investment in inventory is very high in most of the undertakings engaged in manufacturing, whole-sale
and retail trade. The amount of investment is sometimes more in inventory than in other assets. About 90 per
cent part of working capital is invested in inventories. It is necessary for every management to give proper

Working Capital Management                                                                              LESSON 17

attention to inventory management. A proper planning of purchasing, handling, storing and accounting should
form a part of inventory management. An efficient system of inventory management will determine (a) what to
purchase (b) how much to purchase (c) from where to purchase (d) where to store, etc.
The purpose of inventory management is to keep the stocks in such a way that neither there is over-stocking nor
under-stocking. The over-stocking will mean reduction of liquidity and starving of other production processes;
under-stocking, on the other hand, will result in stoppage of work. The investments in inventory should keep in
reasonable limits.

 Objectives of inventory management
The main objectives of inventory management are operational and financial. The operational objectives mean
that the materials and spares should be available in sufficient quantity so that work is not disrupted for want of
inventory. The financial objective means that investments in inventories should not remain idle and minimum
working capital should be locked in it. The following are the objectives of inventory management:
    1)   To ensure continuous supply of materials, spares and finished goods so that production should not
         suffer at any time and the customers demand should also be met.
   2)    To avoid both over-stocking and under-stocking of inventory.
   3)    To maintain investments in inventories at the optimum level as required by the operational and sales
         activities.
   4)    To keep material cost under control so that they contribute in reducing cost of production and overall
         costs.
   5)    To eliminate duplication in ordering or replenishing stocks. This is possible with the help of centralizing
         purchases.
   6)    To minimize losses through deterioration, pilferage, wastages and damages.
   7)    To design proper organization for inventory management. A clear cut accountability should be fixed at
         various levels of the organization.
   8)    To ensure perpetual inventory control so that materials shown in stock ledgers should be actually lying
         in the stores.
   9)    To ensure right quality goods at reasonable prices. Suitable quality standards will ensure proper quality
         of stocks. The price-analysis, the cost-analysis and value-analysis will ensure payment of proper prices.
  10)    To facilitate furnishing of data for short-term and long-term planning and control of inventory.

 Risk associated with inventory
The risk in inventory management signifies the chance that inventories cannot be turned over into cash through
normal sale without a loss. These risks are due to following three factors:
1. Price decline:
It may result from an increase in the market supply of products, introduction of a new competitive product and
price reduction by competitors.
2. Product deterioration:
It may result due to holding a product too long or it may occur when inventories are held under improper
conditions of light, heat, humidity and pressure.

3. Obsolescence:
It is sue to changes in customer taste, new production techniques, improvement in the product design,
specifications etc.
Costs associated with inventory
The followings are the costs which are associated with inventory:
      1.   Material Cost
   2.      Ordering Cost
   3.      Inventory Carrying Costs
   4.      Stock-out or Shortage Costs

 TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES OF INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
Effective inventory management requires an effective control system for inventories. A proper inventory control
not only helps in solving the acute problem of liquidity but also increases profits and causes substantial
reduction in the working capital of the concern.
The following are the important tools and techniques of inventory management and control:
      1)   Determination of Stock Levels
   2)      Determination of safety stocks
   3)      Selecting a proper System of Ordering for Inventory
   4)      Determination of Economic Order Quantity
   5)      A-B-C Analysis
   6)      VED Analysis
   7)      JIT Analysis
   8)      Inventory Turnover Ratio
   9)      Ageing Schedule of Inventories
  10)      Perpetual Inventory System

 Determination of Stock Levels, Safety Stocks & EOQ
(1) Determination of Stock Levels:
Carrying of too much and too little of inventories is detrimental to the firm. If the inventory level is too little,
the firm will face frequent stock-outs involving heavy ordering cost and if the inventory level is high it will
be unnecessary tie-up of capital. Therefore, an efficient inventory management requires that a firm should
maintain an optimum level of inventory where inventory costs are the minimum and at the same time there is no
stock-out which may result in loss of sale or stoppage of production. Various stock levels are discussed as such.
  (a)      Minimum Level: This represents the quantity of stock that should be held at all time, stock level
           is normally not allowed falling below this level. This level of stock is a buffer stock for use during
           emergencies. Fall in stock level below minimum level will indicate potential danger to the business.
           Thus, extra efforts have to be taken to expedite the supply.

            Minimum Stock Level = Re-order Level - (Normal Consumption x Normal re-order Period)


682
Working Capital Management                                                                               LESSON 17

		 The following factors are to be considered in fixing the minimum level:
           i)     Nature of items of materials.
          ii)     Minimum time required for delivery.
          iii)    Rate of consumption of materials.
          iv) Stock-out costs which include loss of contribution margin, loss of Goodwill etc.
  (b)    Re-ordering Level:
		       When the quantity of materials reaches a certain figure then fresh order is sent to get materials again. The
         order is sent before the materials reach minimum stock level. The rate of ordering level is fixed between
         minimum level and maximum level. The rate of consumption, number of days required replenishing the
         stocks, and maximum quantities of materials required on any day are taken into account while fixing
         re-ordering level. Re-ordering level is fixed with the following formula:

                      Re-ordering Level = Maximum Consumption x Maximum Re-order period

   (c)   Maximum Level:
		 It is the quantity of materials beyond which a firm should not exceed its stocks. If the quantity exceeds
   maximum level limit then it will be overstocking. A firm should avoid overstocking because it will result
   in high material costs. Overstocking will mean blocking of more working capital, more space for storing
   the materials, more wastage of materials and more chances of losses from obsolescence. Maximum
   stock level will depend upon the following factors:
           1)     The availability of capital for the purchase of materials:
          2)      The maximum requirements of materials at any point of time.
          3)      The availability of space for storing the materials.
          4)      The rate of consumption of materials during lead time.
          5)      The cost of maintaining the stores.
          6)      The possibility of fluctuations in prices.
          7) The nature of materials: If the materials are perishable in nature, then they cannot be stored for
             long.
          8)      Availability of materials.
          9)      Restrictions imposed by the Government
         10)      The possibility of change in fashions will also affect the maximum level.
		 The following formula may be used for calculating maximum stock level:

                 Maximum stock level = Re-ordering Level + Re-ordering Quantity-(Minimum Consumption x
                                              Minimum Re-ordering period)

  (d)    Danger Level:
		 It is the level beyond which materials should not fall in any case. If danger level arises then immediate
   steps should be taken to replenish the stocks even if more cost is incurred in arranging the materials.
   If materials are not arranged immediately there is a possibility of stoppage of work. Danger level is
   determined with the following formula:

                                                                                                                683
EP-CA&FM                                                                                Working Capital Management


          Danger Level = Average Consumption x Maximum re-ordering period for emergency purchases

   (e)   Average Stock Level:
		 The average stock level is calculated as such:

                       Average Stock Level = Minimum Stock Level + 1/2 of re-ordering quantity
                                                             OR
                         Average Stock Level = Minimum Stock Level + Maximum Stock Level

   (f)   Determination of Safety Stocks:
		 Safety stock is a buffer to meet some unanticipated increase in usage. The usage of inventory cannot
   be perfectly forecast. It fluctuates over a period of time. The demand for materials may fluctuate and
   delivery of inventory may also be delayed and in such a situation the firm can face a problem of stock-
   out. The stock out can prove costly by affecting the smooth working of the concern. In order to protect
   against the stock out arising out of usage fluctuations, firms usually maintain some margin of safety
   stocks. The basic problem is to determine the level of quantity of safety stocks. Two costs are involved
   in the determination of this stock i.e. opportunity cost of stock-outs and the carrying costs. The stock-
   outs of raw materials cause production disruption resulting in higher cost of production. Similarly, the
   stock-outs of finished goods result in the failure of the firm in competition as the firm cannot provide
   proper customer service. If a firm maintains low level of safety, frequent stock-outs will occur resulting
   in the larger opportunity costs. On the other hand, the larger quantities of safety stocks involve higher
   carrying costs.

 ORDERING SYSTEMS OF INVENTORY:
The basic problem of inventory is to decide the re-order point. This point indicates when an order should be
placed. The order point is determined with the help of these things:
   (a)   Average consumption rate,
   (b)   Duration of lead time,
   (c)   Economic order quantity,
When the inventory is depleted to lead time consumption, the order should be placed. There are three prevalent
systems of ordering and a concern can choose any one these:
   (a)   Fixed order quantity system generally known as economic order quantity (EOQ) system;
   (b)   Fixed period order system or period re-ordering system or periodic review system;
   (c)   Single order and scheduled part delivery system.

 Economic Order Quantity (EOQ):
EOQ is an important factor in controlling the inventory. It is a quantity of inventory which can reasonably be
ordered economically at a time. It is also known as ‘Standard Order Quantity’, ‘Economic Lot Size,’ or ‘Economical
Ordering Quantity’. In determining this point ordering costs and carrying costs are taken into consideration.
Ordering costs are basically the cost of getting an item of inventory and it includes cost of placing an order.
Carrying cost includes costs of storage facilities, property insurance, loss of value through physical deterioration,
cost of obsolescence. Either of these two costs affects the profits of the firm adversely and management tries

684
Working Capital Management                                                                             LESSON 17

to balance these two costs. The balancing or reconciliation point is known as economic order quantity. The
quantity may be calculated with the help of the following formula:

                                                          2 × R × CP
                                                EOQ =
                                                              CH

Where R = Annual quantity used (in units)
          CP = Cost of placing an order / ordering cost per order
          CH = Cost of holding one unit/Inventory carrying cost of one unit / carrying cost of one unit per year
Assumptions of EOQ:
    i)    While calculating EOQ the following assumptions are made:
   ii)    The supply of goods is satisfactory. The goods are purchased whenever these are needed.
   iii)   The quantity to be purchased by the concern is certain.
   iv)    The prices of goods are stable. It helps to stabilize carrying costs.

Illustration-11:
Two components X and Y are used as follows:
Normal usage                           300 units per week
Maximum usage                          450 units per week
Minimum usage                          150 units per week
Reorder Quantity                       X – 2,000 units and Y – 4,000 units
Re-order Period                        X – 4 to 6 weeks and Y – 2 to 4 weeks
Calculate for each component —

    1)    Reorder Level = Maximum Usage × Maximum Reorder Period
			                          = 450 × 6		                               = 450 × 4
			                          = 2,700 units		                           = 1,800 units
   2)     Minimum Level = Reorder Level – (Normal Usage × Average Delivery Period)
			                          = 2,700 – (300 × 5)		                     = 1,800 – (300 × 3)
			                          = 2,700 – 1,500		                         = 1,800 – 900
			                          = 1,200 units		                           = 900 units
   3)     Maximum Level = Reorder Level + Reorder Quantity – (Minimum Usage × Minimum Delivery Period)
			                          = 2,700 + 2,000 – (150 × 4)		             = 1,800 + 4,000 – (150 × 2)
			                          = 4,700 – 600		                           = 5,800 – 300
			                          = 4,100 units		                           = 5,500 units

                                                                                                              685

Illustration-13:
A manufacturer requires 1,000 units of a raw material per month. The ordering cost is Rs.15 per order. The
carrying cost in addition to Rs.2 per unit is estimated to be 15% of the average inventory per unit per year. The
purchase price of the raw material is Rs.10 per unit. Find economic lot size and total cost. The manufacturer is
offered a 5% discount in purchase price for orders of 2,000 units or more but less than 5,000 units. A further 2%
discount is available for orders of 5,000 units or more. Which of these three alternative ways of purchase he
should select?

The manufacturer should opt the alternative of 5% discount and order for 2,000 units at each time because at
this option, the total inventory cost is the minimum.

 Just-in-Time (JIT) System
Japanese firms popularized the just-in-time (JIT) system in the world. In a JIT system material or the manufactured
components and parts arrive to the manufacturing sites or stores just few hours before they are put to use. JIT
system eliminates the necessity of carrying large inventories and thus, saves carrying and other related
costs to the manufacturer. The system requires perfect understanding and coordination between the
manufacturer and suppliers in terms of the timing of delivery and quality of the material. The success of
the system depends on how well a company manages its suppliers. The system puts tremendous pressure
on suppliers.

 ABC Inventory Control System
Large numbers of firms have to maintain several types of inventories. It is not desirable to keep the same
degree of control on all the items. The firm should pay maximum attention to those items whose value is the
highest. The firm should, therefore, classify inventories to identify which item should receive the most effort in
controlling. This analytical approach is called the ABC analysis. The high value items are classified as ‘A items’
and would be under the highest control. “C items’ represent relatively least value and would be under simple
control. ‘B items’ fall in between these two categories and requires reasonable attention of management. The
ABC analysis concentrates on important items and is also known as control by importance and exception (CIE).
This approach is also known as proportionate value analysis (PVA).

average cost per unit is presented below. Suggest a break-down of the items into ABC classification assuming

 VED Analysis
The VED analysis is used generally for spare parts. Spare parts are classified as vital (V), essential (E) and
desirable (D). The vital spares are must for running the concern smoothly and these must be stored adequately.
The E types of spares are also necessary but their stocks may be kept at low figures. The stocking of D type
of spare may be avoided at times, if the lead time of these spares is less, then stocking of these spares can be
avoided.

 Inventory Turnover Ratio
It indicates whether inventories have been used efficiently or not. The purpose is to ensure the blocking of only
required minimum funds in inventory. Inventory conversion period may also be calculated to find the average
time taken for clearing the stocks.
Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Value of Inventory

 Ageing of Inventories
According to this method, an inventory is to be classified according to the dates of their purchase or manufacture.
Thus, schedule of inventories can be prepared on the basis of the age of different items of inventories. Efforts
should be made to clear off the old inventories at the earliest.

 Perpetual Inventory System
Perpetual inventory system implies maintenance of up-to-date stock records and. According to Weldon, it may
be defined as “a method of recording stores balances after every receipt and issue to facilitate regular checking
and to obviate closing down for stock-taking”. The basic object of this system is to make available details about
the quantity and value of stock of each item at all time.

 MANAGEMENT OF RECEIVABLES
Receivables management is the process of making decisions relating to investment in trade debtors. Certain
investment in receivables is necessary to increase the sales and the profits of a firm. But at the same time
investment in this asset involves cost considerations also. Further, there is always a risk of bad debts too. Thus,
the objective of receivable management is to take sound decision as regards investment in debtors. In the
words of Bolton, S.E., the objective of receivables management is “to promote sales and profits until that point
is reached where the return on investment in further funding of receivables is less than the cost of funds raised
to finance that additional credit”.

 Costs of maintaining receivables:
A firm incurs the following costs on maintaining receivables:
    1)   Cost of Financing Receivables:
		 ‘Selling goods or services on credit’ means allowing the customers to use concern’s funds. The concern
   incurs some cost for collecting funds which finance receivables.
   2)    Administrative Costs:
		 This relates to costs for maintaining accounts of debtors and cost of conducting investigation regarding
   potential credit customers to determine their credit worthiness.
   3)    Cost of Collection:
		 This includes cost of reminders to the customers, cost of persons sent for collection and cost of legal
   recourse to recover money from the defaulting customers.
   4)    Defaulting Costs or Bad Debts:
		 The amount which the firm is unable to realize from the customers is known as bad debts.

 Scope of receivables management
The scope of receivable management is very wide. It includes the following aspects:
    1)   Determining Credit Policy:
		 The term ‘credit policy’ refers to those decision variables that influence the amount of trade credit,
   i.e., the investment in receivables. The credit policy may be lenient (loose or expensive) or tight (or
   restrictive). In developing an optimum credit policy, the financial executives will have to compare the
   benefits of credit extension with the costs of credit. The major considerations in costs are liquidity
   and opportunity costs. On the other hand, in benefits of a liberal credit policy, the profitability is the

                                                                                                               689
EP-CA&FM                                                                            Working Capital Management

           major criterion. The optimum credit policy will be determined by the trade off between liquidity and
           profitability as shown in the following figure:




   2)      Determining Credit Terms:

		 The second aspect of receivables management is concerned with determining credit terms. The ‘credit
   terms’ include the decisions like credit period, the quantum of cash discount, period of cash discount
   and fixing the credit standards. The extent to which credit standards can be liberalized should depend
   upon the matching between the profits arising due to increased sales and the costs to be incurred on
   the increased sales.

   3)      Evaluating the Credit Applicants:

		 The third important aspect of receivables management is to lay down clear-cut guidelines and
   procedures for granting credit to individual customers. A firm can not follow the policy of treating all
   customers equal for the purpose of extending credit. Each case is to be decided on its own merits.
   Hence, this function will include the following steps: Collection of credit information about the customers,
   investigation in the credit capacity of these customers, credit analysis, fixing credit limits for each of
   them and lastly, deciding collection procedures. In taking a decision about individuals, five ‘C’s are
   important: character, capacity, capitals, collateral and conditions.

   4)      Determining Collection Policies and Methods:

		 Next aspect is collection policy and setting collection methods. A well-conceived collection policy is
   needed because all customers do not pay the firm’s bills in time. There are certain customers who are
   slow payers and some are non-payers. Therefore, the collection policy should aim at accelerating
   collections from slow prayers and reducing bad debt losses.

 FACTORS AFFECTING THE SIZE OF RECEIVABLES
The level of investment in accounts receivable depends upon two types of factors- general and specific. General
factors are external factors while specific factors are internal factors.

      1)   General Factors:

		 These are those factors which are common to all firms and all types of assets. They include the type
   and nature of business, anticipated volume of sales operations, price-level variations, availability of
   funds, interest rate, pace of technological development, industry norms, etc.

   2)   Specific Factors:

		 The main determinants of the level of investment in receivables are as follows:

         a)   The Volume of Credit Sales:

		 The most important variable affecting the level of the receivables is the volume of credit sales. As
   sales increases, receivables expand. As sales fall down, the receivables also decline.

         b)   Terms of Sale:

		 If the firm sells goods only for cash on delivery in order to avoid tying its funds in receivables and
   risking bad debts losses this item will altogether not appear in the balance sheet of the firm. But
   credit is the soul of business. Hence, if the firm sells on credit and credit period allowed is more,
   then receivables will also be more.

         c)   Stability of Sales:

		 If the business is of seasonal character, its credit sale in the season will be large, simultaneously;
   a large volume of receivables will be there. If a firm supplies goods on installment basis its
   investment in receivables will be high.

         d)   Credit and Collection Policy:

		 If a firm has a lenient or relatively liberal credit policy, it will experience a high level of receivables
   as compared to a firm with a more rigid or stringent credit policy.

         e) Bills Discounting or Endorsement:

		 If bills are got discounted with banks or endorsed to third parties the level of investment in this
   asset will be automatically low.

         f)   Credit Period Allowed:

Longer the period of credit allowed, higher will be the volume of receivables.

There will be increase in fixed cost by Rs.50,000 on account of increase of sales beyond 25% of present level.

The company plans on a return of 20% on investment in receivables.

 Financing of Permanent/Fixed or Long-Term Working Capital
Permanent working capital should be financed in such a manner that the enterprise may have its uninterrupted
use for a sufficiently long period. There are five important sources of permanent or long-term working capital.
      1.   Shares:
		 Issue of shares is the most important source for raising the permanent or long-term capital. A Company
   can issue various types of shares as equity shares, preference shares and deferred shares. According
   to the Companies Act, 1956, however, a public company cannot issue deferred shares. Preference
   shares carry preferential rights in respect of dividend at a fixed rate and in regard to the repayment
   of capital at the time of winding up the company. Equity shares do not have any fixed commitment
   charge and the dividend on these shares is to be paid subject to the availability of sufficient profits.
   As far as possible, a company should raise the maximum amount of permanent capital by the issue of
   shares.
   2.      Debentures:
		 A debenture is an instrument issued by the company acknowledging its debt to its holder. It is also
   an important method of raising long-term or permanent working capital. The debenture-holders are
   the creditor of the company; fixed rate of interest is paid on debentures. The interest on debentures is
   a charge against profit and loss account. The debentures are generally given floating charge on the
   assets of the company.

   3.   Public Deposits:
		 Public deposits are the fixed deposits accepted by a business enterprise directly from the public. This
   source of raising short term and medium-term finance was very popular in the absence of banking
   facilities. In the past, generally, public deposits were accepted by textile industries in Ahmadabad and
   Bombay for periods of 6 months to 1 year. But now-a-days even long-term deposits for 5 to 7 years are
   accepted by the business houses.
   4.   Plugging Back of Profits:
		 It means the reinvestments by concern of its surplus earnings in its business. It is an internal source
   of finance and is most suitable for an established firm for its expansion, modernization, replacement
   etc. This method of finance has a number of advantages as it is the cheapest rather cost-free source
   of finance; there is no need to keep securities, there is no dilution of control, it ensures stable dividend
   policy and gains confidence of the public. But excessive resort to plugging back of profits may lead to
   monopolies, misuse of funds, overcapitalization, and speculation etc.
   5.   Loans from Financial Institutions:
		 Financial institutions such as Commercial Banks, Life Insurance Corporation, Industrial Finance
   Corporation of India, State Financial Corporation, State Industrial Development Corporations, Industrial
   Development Bank of India, etc. also provide short-term, medium ­term and long-term loans. This source
   of finance is more suitable to meet the medium-term demands of working capital. Interest is charged on
   such loans at a fixed rate and the amount of the loan is to be repaid by way of installments in a number
   of years.

 Financing of Temporary, Variable or Short-term Working Capital
   1.   Indigenous Bankers:
		 Private money-lenders and other country bankers used to be the only source of finance prior to the
   establishment of commercial banks. They used charge very high rates of interest and exploited the
   customers to the largest extent possible. Now-a-days with the development of commercial banks they
   have lost their monopoly. But even today some business houses have to depend upon indigenous
   bankers for obtaining loans to meet their working capital requirements.
   2.   Trade Credit:
		 Trade credit refers to the credit extended by the suppliers of goods in the normal course of business.
   As present day commerce is built upon credit, the trade credit arrangement of a firm with its suppliers
   is an important source of short-term finance. The credit-worthiness of a firm and the confidence of its
   suppliers are the main basis of securing trade credit. It is mostly granted on an open account basis
   whereby supplier sends goods to the buyer for the payment to be received in future as per terms of the
   sales invoice. It may also take the form of bills payable whereby the buyer signs a bill of exchanges
   payable on a specified future date.
		 The main advantages of trade credit as a source of short-term finance include:
          i)    It is an easy and convenient method of finance.
         ii)    It is flexible as the credit increases with the growth of the firm.
         iii)   It is informal and spontaneous source of finance.
However, the biggest disadvantage of this method of finance is charging of higher prices by the suppliers and
loss of cash discount.

                                                                                                           695
EP-CA&FM                                                                           Working Capital Management

      1.   Installment Credit:
		 This is another method by which the assets are purchased and the possession of goods is taken
   immediately but the payment is made in installments over a pre-determined period of time. Generally,
   interest is charged on the unpaid price or it may be adjusted in the price. But, in any case, it provides
   funds for some time and is used as a source of short-term working capital by many business houses
   which have difficult fund position.
   2.      Advances:
		 Some business houses get advances from their customers and agents against orders, and this source
   is a short-term source of finance to them. It is a cheap source of finance and in order to minimize
   their investment in working capital, some firms having long production cycle, specially the firms
   manufacturing industrial products prefer to take advances from their customers.
   3.      Factoring or Accounts Receivable Credit:
		 Another method of raising short-term finance is through accounts receivable credit offered by
   commercial banks and factors. A commercial bank may provide finance by discounting the bills or
   invoices of its customers. Thus, a firm gets immediate payment for sales made on credit. A factor is a
   financial institution which offers services relating to management and financing of debts arising out of
   credit sales. Factoring is becoming popular all over the world on account of various services offered by
   the institutions engaged in it.
   4.      Accrued Expenses:
		 Accrued expenses are the expenses which have been incurred but not yet due and hence not yet paid
   also. These simply represent a liability that a firm has to pay for the services already received by it. The
   most important items of accruals are wages and salaries, interest, and taxes. Wages and salaries are
   usually paid on monthly, fortnightly or weekly basis for the services already rendered by employees.
   The longer the payment-period, the greater is the amount of liability towards employees or the funds
   provided by them. In the same manner, accrued interest and taxes also constitute a short-term source of
   finance. Taxes are paid after collection and in the intervening period serve as a good source of finance.
   Even income-tax is paid periodically much after the profits have been earned. Like taxes, interest is also
   paid periodically while the funds are used continuously by a firm. Thus, all accrued expense can be
   used as a source of finance.
   5.      Deferred Incomes:
		 Deferred incomes are incomes received in advance before supplying goods or services. They represent
   funds received by a firm for which it has to supply goods or services in future. These funds increase the
   liquidity of a firm and constitute an important source of short-term finance.
   6.      Commercial Paper:
		 Commercial paper represents unsecured promissory notes issued by firms to raise short-term funds.
   It is an important money market instrument in advanced countries like U.S.A. In India, the Reserve
   Bank of India introduced commercial paper in the Indian money market on the recommendation of the
   Vaghul Committee. But only large companies enjoying high credit rating and sound financial health
   can issue commercial paper to raise short-term funds. The Reserve Bank of India has laid down a
   number of conditions to determine eligibility of a company for the issue of commercial paper. Only a
   company which is listed on the stock exchange, has a net worth of at least Rs.10 crore and a maximum
   permissible bank finance of not less than Rs.25 crore, can issue commercial paper. The maturity period
   of commercial paper runs between 91 and 180 days.
      7.   Working Capital Finance by Commercial Banks:
		 Commercial banks are the most important source of short-term capital. The major portion of working

696
Working Capital Management                                                                             LESSON 17

        capital loans are provided by commercial banks. They provide a wide variety of loans tailored to meet
        the specific requirements of a concern. The different forms in which the banks normally provide loans
        and advances are as follows:
         (i)    Loans:
		 When a bank makes an advance in lump-sum against some security it is called a loan. In case
   of a loan, a specified amount is sanctioned by the bank to the customer. The entire loan amount
   is paid to the borrower either in cash or by credit to his account. The borrower is required to pay
   interest on the entire amount of the loan from the date of the sanction. A loan may be repayable
   in lump sum or installments.
         (ii)   Cash Credit:
		 A cash credit is an arrangement by which a bank allows his customer to borrow money up to a
   certain limit against some tangible securities or guarantees. The customer can withdraw from his
   cash credit limit according to his needs and he can also deposit any surplus amount with him. The
   interest in case of cash credit is charged on the daily balance and not on the entire amount of the
   account. For these reasons, it is the most favorite mode of borrowing by industrial and commercial
   concerns.
        (iii)   Overdrafts:
		 Overdraft means an agreement with a bank by which a current account-holder is allowed to
   withdraw more than the balance to his credit up to a certain limit. There are no restrictions for
   operation of overdraft limits. The interest is charged on daily overdrawn balances. The main
   difference between cash credit and overdraft is that overdraft is allowed for a short period and is
   a temporary accommodation whereas the cash credit is allowed for a longer period.
        (iv)    Purchasing and Discounting of Bills:
		 Purchasing and discounting of bills is the most important form in which a bank lends without any
   collateral security. The seller draws a bill of exchange on the buyer of goods on credit. The bank
   purchases the bills payable on demand and credits the customer’s account with the amount of
   bill less discount. At the maturity of the bills, bank presents the bill to its accepter for payment. In
   case the bill discounted is dishonored by non-payment, the bank recovers the full amount of the
   bill from the customer along with expenses in that connection.

 POLICIES FOR FINANCING CURRENT ASSETS
A firm can adopt different financing policies vis-a-vis current assets. A company may be referred to as:
    l   Matching Approach
    l   Conservative Approach
    l   Aggressive Approach

 Matching Approach
The firm can adopt a financial plan which matches the expected life of assets with the expected life of the source
of funds raised to finance assets. Thus, a ten-year loan may be raised to finance a plant with an expected life
of ten years; stock of goods to be sold in thirty days may be financed with a thirty day commercial paper or a
bank loan.
Using long-term financing for short-term assets is expensive as funds will not be utilized for the full period.
Similarly, financing long-term assets with short-term financing is costly as well as inconvenient as arrangement
for the new short-term financing will have to be made on a continuing basis.


                                                                                                              697

When the firm follows matching approach (also known as holding approach), long-term financing will be used
to finance fixed assets and permanent current assets and short-term financing to finance temporary or variable
current assets. However, it should be realized that exact matching is not possible because of the uncertainty
about the expected lives of assets.
The following figure is used to illustrate the matching plan overtime. The firm’s fixed assets and permanent
current assets are financed with long-term funds and as the level of these assets increases, the long-term
financing level also increases. The temporary or variable current assets are financed with short-term funds and
as their level increases, the level of short-term financing also increases. Under matching plan, no short-term
financing will be used if the firm has a fixed current assets need only.




                                        Financing under matching plan
 Conservative Approach
A firm in practice may adopt a conservative approach in financing its current and fixed assets. The financing
policy of the firm is said to be conservative when it depends more on long-term funds for financing needs.
Under a conservative plan, the firm finances its permanent assets and also a part of temporary current assets
with long-term financing. In the periods when the firm has no need for temporary current assets, the idle long-
term funds can be invested in the tradable securities to conserve liquidity. The conservative plan relies heavily
on long-term financing and, therefore, the firm has less risk of facing the problem of shortage of funds. The
conservative financing policy is shown in following figure:

 Aggressive Approach
A firm may be aggressive in financing its assets. An aggressive policy is said to be followed by the firm when
it uses more short-term financing than warranted by the matching plan. Under an aggressive policy, the firm
finances a part of its permanent current assets with short-term financing. Some extremely aggressive firms
may even finance a part of their fixed assets with short-term financing. The relatively more use of short-term
financing makes the firm more risky. The aggressive financing is illustrated in figure as below:




                                             Aggressive financing

 BANKING NORMS AND MACRO ASPECT
Banks normally provide working capital finance to hold an acceptable level of current assets viz. raw materials
and stores, stocks in progress, finished goods and sundry debtors for achieving a pre-determined level of
production and sales. The assessment of funds required to be blocked in each of these items of the working
capital required by an industry is discussed as under:
   1.   Raw Material: Raw material, of any kind is necessarily required by an industrial unit to continue the
        production process. Different raw material could be procured from different sources may be indigenous
        or overseas and accordingly different treatment of procurement time is bound to be given. Mode of
        payment for the raw material may also be different. Thus, affecting the credit requirements of the client,
        the funds blocked up in procurement and stocking of material will have to be taken into consideration.
        Total materials including those in transit and for which advance payment is made can normally be
        expressed in terms of number of months consumption and requirements of funds can be assessed by
        multiplying the figure by the amount of monthly consumption.
   2.   Work in Process: The time taken by the raw material to be converted into finished product is the period
        of material processing and all the expenses of the process are involved in it. Therefore, the assessment
        of funds blocked in the process is made by taking into account the raw material consumption during
        the processing period and the expenses incurred during such period i.e. the cost of production for the
        period of processing.
   3.   Finished goods in the next stage: The funds blocked in finished goods inventories are assessed by
        estimating the manufacturing cost of product.
   4.   Sundry Debtors: When goods sold is not realised in cash, sundry debtors are generated. The credit
        period followed by a particular industrial unit in practice is generally the result of industry practices.

                                                                                                              699
EP-CA&FM                                                                                 Working Capital Management

           Investment in accounts receivable remains blocked from the time of sale till the time amount is realised
           from debtors. The assessment of funds blocked should be on the basis of cost of production of the
           materials against which bank extends working capital credit.
   5.      Expenses: One month’s total expenses, direct or indirect, are provided by way of cushion in assessing
           the requirement of funds which may include rent, salaries, etc. depending upon the length of operating
           cycle.
   6.      Trade Credit received on purchases reduces working capital funds requirements and has to be taken
           into account for correct assessment of funds.
      7.   Advances received along with purchase orders for the products also reduce the funds requirements for
           working capital.
Taking into consideration the above parameters of operating cycle, the working capital for a unit can be
assessed as under:

  S. No.         Component of Working                            Basis of Calculation                           r

Banks do not provide the entire amount of r 300 towards working capital. At every stage bank would insist upon
the borrower’s stake in the form of margin which depends on various factors like saleable quality of product,
durability, price fluctuations, market conditions and business environment, etc. Thus, the bank at every stage
would allow the margin at the pre-determined rate as noted below:

 Factoring
As the accounts receivable amount to the blocking of the firm’s funds, the need for an outlet to impart these
liquidity is obvious. Other than the lag between the date of sale and the date of receipt of dues, collection
of receivables involves a cost of inconvenience associated with tapping every individual debtor. Thus, if the
firm could contract out the collection of accounts receivable it would be saved from many things such as
administration of sales ledger, collection of debt and the management of associated risk of bad-debts etc.
Factoring is a type of financial service which involves an outright sale of the receivables of a firm to a financial
institution called the factor which specialises in the management of trade credit. Under a typical factoring
arrangement, a factor collects the accounts on the due dates, effects payments to the firm on these dates
(irrespective of whether the customers have paid or not) and also assumes the credit risks associated with the
collection of the accounts. As such factoring is nothing but a substitute for in-house management of receivables.
A factor not only enables a firm to get rid of the work involved in handling the credit and collection of receivables,
but also in placing its sales in effect on cash basis.

 Definition and functions
Factoring is a financial service in which the business entity sells its Trade receivables/debtors to a third party at
a discount in order to raise funds. The Bank/Financial institution purchasing the receivable is known as factor.
Factoring may be with or without recourse. ‘With a recourse’ means that in the event of bad debts factor (Bank)
can approach the ‘supplier’.
Though the purchase of book debts is fundamental to the functioning of factoring, there are a number of
functions associated with this unique financial services. A proper appreciation of these functions would enable
one to distinguish it from the other sources of finance against receivables. They undertake:
    l   credit and collection function;
    l   credit protection;
    l   encashing of receivables;
    l   collateral functions such as:
         (a) loans on inventory,
         (b) loans on fixed assets, other security and on open credit,
         (c)   advisory services to clients.

 Factoring vs. Accounts Receivable Loans
Accounts receivable loan is simply a loan secured by a firm’s accounts receivable by way of hypothecation
or assignment of such receivables with the power to collect the debts under a power of attorney. In case of
factoring however, there is an outright sale of receivables. Thus, in case of the former, the bank may debit
client’s account for ‘handling charges’ if the debt turns out to be bad as against non-recourse factoring.

 Factoring vs. Bill Discounting
Under a bill discounting arrangement, the drawer undertakes the responsibility of collecting the bills and
remitting the proceeds to the financing agency, whereas under factoring agreement, the factor collects client’s
bills. Moreover, bill discounting is always with recourse whereas factoring can be either with recourse or without
recourse. The finance house discounting bills does not offer any non-financial services unlike a factor which
finances and manages the receivables of a client.

 Mechanics of Factoring
Factoring offers a very flexible mode of cash generation against receivables. Once a line of credit is established,
availability of cash is directly geared to sales so that as sales increase so does the availability of finance. The
dynamics of factoring comprises of the sequence of events outlined in figure.

   (1)   Seller (client) negotiates with the factor for establishing factoring relationship.

   (2)   Seller requests credit check on buyer (client).

   (3)   Factor checks credit credentials and approves buyer. For each approved buyer a credit limit and period
         of credit are fixed.

   (4)   Seller sells goods to buyer.

   (5)   Seller sends invoice to factor. The invoice is accounted in the buyers account in the factor’s sales
         ledger.

   (1)    Factor sends copy of the invoice to buyer.

   (2)    Factor advices the amount to which seller is entitled after retaining a margin, say 20%, the residual
          amount paid later.

   (3)    On expiry of the agreed credit period, buyer makes payment of invoice to the factor.

   (4)    Factor pays the residual amount to seller.

Types of Factoring: Factoring services may be rendered to cover domestic as well as international sales.
The various services offered by factors for domestic sales are of six types whose essential characteristics are

 Forfaiting
Forfaiting is a form of financing of receivables pertaining to international trade. It denotes the purchase of
trade bills/ promissory notes by a bank/financial institution without recourse to the seller. The purchase is in
the form of discounting the documents covering entire risk of non-payment in collection. All risks and collection
problems are fully the responsibility of the purchaser (forfeiter) who pays cash to seller after discounting the
bills/notes. The salient features of forfaiting as a form of export relating financing are as under:

    (i)   The exporter sells and delivers goods to the importer on deferred payment basis.

   (ii)   The importer draws a series of promissory notes in favour of the exporter for payment including interest
          charge. Alternatively the exporter draws a series of bill which are accepted by the importer.


                                                                                                               703
EP-CA&FM                                                                                  Working Capital Management

  (iii)   The bills/notes are sent to the exporter. The promissory notes/bills are guaranteed by a bank which
          may not necessarily be the importer’s bank. The guarantee by the bank is referred to as an Avail,
          defined as an endorsement by a bank guaranteeing payment by the importer.

  (iv)    The exporter enters into a forfaiting agreement with a forfeiter which is usually a reputed bank. The
          exporter sells the avalled notes/bills to the bank at a discount without recours and receives the payment.

   (v)    The forfeiter may hold these notes/bills till maturity for payment by the importers bank.

 Forfaiting vs. Export Factoring
Forfaiting is similar to cross border factoring to the extent both have common features of non recourse and
advance payment. But they differ in several important respects:

   (a)    A forfeiter discounts the entire value of the note/bill but the factor finances between 75-85% and retains
          a factor reserve which is paid after maturity.

   (b)    The avalling bank which provides an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee is a critical element in
          the forfaiting arrangement wheras in a facoring deal, particularly non-recourse type, the export factor
          bases his credit decision on the credit standards of the exporter.

   (c)    Forfaiting is a pure financing arrangement while factoring also includes ledger administration, collection
          and so on.

   (d)    Factoring is essentially a short term financing deal. Forfaiting finances notes/bills arising out of deferred
          credit transaction spread over three to five years.

   (e)    A factor does not guard against exchange rate fluctuations; a forfeiter charges a premium for such risk.

Working Notes:-
    i)    25% of production i.e. 26,000 units are sold for cash. Hence, credit sales are 78,000 units. The cash
          cost of debtors is calculated on these units.
    ii)   It is assumed that full material is issued in the beginning and labour and overhead accrue evenly.
   iii)   Profit on cash as well as credit sales may or may not be the source of working capital. Income tax and
          dividend paid are to be adjusted from these profits. Hence, profits are ignored.
   iv)    All the overheads are assumed to be variable. Working capital will be reduced by the amount of
          depreciation. In absence of these data, estimates cannot be accurate.
   v)     It is assumed that stock of raw material and finished goods is maintained on the basis of goods
          produced.

The Company’s current credit policy is to allow unlimited credit to firms in categories 1 to 3; limited credit to firms
in category 4 and no additional credit to firms in category 5.
As a result, orders amounting to Rs. 25,00,000 from category 4 and Rs. 75,00,000 from category 5 are rejected
every year. If the Good Luck Ltd. makes a 10% gross profit on sales and has an opportunity cost on investment
in receivables of 12%, what would be the effect on profits of allowing full credit to all categories of customers?
Should credit be extended to all categories of customers?

   b)     On the assumption that a 25 trade discount is offered if the minimum order size is 1,000 units, should
          the company go in for the trade discount.
Solution:


  i) EOQ          =


		EOQ             =                             =                  = 612.37 units

 ii) Total Cost without Discount:
		 Purchase Cost           =          10,000 x 200     =		               20, 00,000.00

		 Ordering Cost = (            x O) =      (        x 750)   = 12,247.50

		 Carrying Cost = (            x C) =      (        x 40)    = 12,247.40

								 20, 24,494.90

   iii)   Total Cost with discount:
		 Purchase price per unit= Rs. 200 – 4(2% of Rs. 200) = Rs.196
		 Carrying Cost = 20% of Rs. 196 = Rs. 39.20
		 Total Cost:
		 Purchase Cost = 10,000 x 196 =				                                    19, 60,000
		 Ordering Cost = (            x O) =      (        x 750)   =          7,500

		 Carrying Cost = (            x C) =      (        x 39.20) = 19,600

								
								 19, 87,100
Total Savings = Rs. 20, 24,494.90 – Rs 19, 87,100 = Rs. 37, 394.90
The Company should go in for trade discount.
Question 9- XYZ Limited, manufactures of a special product, follows the policy of EOQ (economic order quantity)
for one of its components. The components details are as follows:
          Purchase price per component				                               Rs. 200
          Cost of an order						Rs. 100
          Annual cost of carrying one unit in inventory		                10% of purchase price
The company has been offered a discount of 2% on the price of the component provided the lot size is 2,000
components at a time.
You are required to : (a) compute the EOQ, (b) Advise whether the quantity discount offer can be accepted.
(Assume that the inventory carrying cost does not vary according to discount policy.) (c) Would your advice
differ if the company is offered 5% discount on a single order?

point; and (iii) The most economical order quantity if the valves cost Rs. 4.50 each instead of Rs. 1.50 each.
Solution:-
    i)    Economic Order Quantity & Frequency of Orders

                               2RO
		EOQ             =
                                C

                              2 x 75,000 x Rs. 18
                                                  = 90,00,000 = 3,000 units
          EOQ     =               1.50 x 20%


                                  Annual Usage
          Number of Orders =
                                         EOQ

                75,000
          =                = 25 orders
                3,000
   ii)    Re-order Point
		 ROP = (Lead Time x Usages Rate) + Safety Stock
		 Or = (L x UR) + S

Question 11- Super Equipment Company estimates its carrying cost at 15% and its ordering cost at Rs.9 per
order. The estimated annual requirement is 48,000 units at a price of Rs.4 per unit.
Compute:
   a)     What is the most economical number of units to order?
   b)     How many orders should be placed in a year?
   c)     How often should an order be placed?
Solution:
   a)     What is the most economical number of units to order?
		 Annual requirement = 48,000 units
		 Ordering cost = Rs.9 per order
		 Carrying cost = 15% of per-unit cost

                                                                                                                 715

		 Per unit cost = Rs.4 per unit
		 EOQ = √ 2 x AR x OC /CC
		 = √ 2 x 48,000 x 9 / 4 x 15%
		 = √1,440,000
		 = 1,200 units
   b)       How many orders should be placed in a year?
		 = Annual requirement / EOQ
		 = 48,000 units / 1,200 units
		 = 40 orders
   c)       How often should an order be placed?
		 Frequency of orders = No. of days in one year / No. of orders
		 = 360 days / 40 orders
		 = 9 days
Question 12- A manufacturing company places a semi-annual order of 24,000 units at a price of Rs.20 per unit.
Its carrying cost is 15% and the order cost is Rs.12 per order.
Compute-
      i)    What is the most economical order quantity?
      ii)   How many orders need to be placed?
Solution:
      i)    EOQ = √ 2 x AR x OC / CC
		 = √ 2 x 48,000 x 12 / 20 x 15%
		 = √384,000
		 = 620 units approximately
      ii)   No. of orders per year = Annual Requirement / EOQ
		 = 48,000 units / 620 units
		 = 77 orders approximately
		 To compute the annual requirement:
		 24,000 units are ordered semi-annually, therefore:
		 Annual requirement = 24,000 units x 2 = 48,000 units

 Policy Recommendation            First                                       Second

The existing policy of 90 days is still the best as it gives the highest net profit of Rs. 1,68,250. The firm may choose
the 2nd best profit earning period which is 45 days credit policy. But if we compare correctly, if we choose this
policy, the credit period is being drastically reduced by 45 days and yet profit is reduced marginally. This may
be a very good option.

 INTRODUCTION
“An Investment is the current commitment of money or other resources in the expectation of reaping future
benefits.” (Zvi Bodie, 2016). Investment means to forego present consumption for the increased consumption
resource available in the future. It can be in any form, assets of all type and kind be it jewellery, commodity,
real estate etc. An investor can buy a share of a company in anticipation of getting good returns in future. In
this section of the book, we are interested in the Financial Assets or securities like equity shares, bonds and
debentures etc. At this point, reader should understand that the financial assets are different from real assets.
While financial assets are the paper claim representing an indirect claim to real assets in form of debt or
equity commitments, the real assets are land and building, machines, etc., which are used to produce goods
and services. Therefore, a security is understood to be a debt or equity instrument issued by a firm in lieu
of the funds raised by it to meet its long term and short term requirements. Among the many properties that
distinguish real from financial assets are liquidity and marketability. These features make the financial assets
more attractive for investors as they are able to liquidate their investments easily in ready and active markets.
The decision of the investor is confronted with many issues, like- in which asset class to invest; shares, bonds,
bullion etc. The investor must decide the time horizon for which he/she needs to invest and balance the
combination of his/her expected return to the risk they are ready to face. These are some of the issues which
any investor will face. In this chapter we shall describe the term securities generally and discuss the prevalent
options available in the Indian Securities market.

 WHAT ARE SECURITIES
Securities may be defined as instruments issued by seekers of funds in the investment market to the providers
of funds in lieu of funds.
These instruments prima facie provide evidence of ownership to the holder of the instrument. The owner is
entitled to receive all the benefits due on the instrument and to retrieve his investment at the time of redemption.
Securities can broadly be divided into two categories – Debt Securities and Equity Securities. However, Section
2(h) of Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956, defines securities as under:
Securities include –
      (i)   shares, scrips, stocks, bonds, debentures, debenture stock or other marketable securities of a like
            nature in or of any incorporated company or other body corporate.
            (ia)    derivative.
            (ib)    units or any other instrument issued by any collective investment scheme to the Investors in such
                    schemes.
            (ic) security receipt as defined in clause (zg) of Section 2 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of
                 Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002.
            (id)    units or any other such instrument issued to the investors under any mutual fund scheme.
   (ii)     Government securities.
            (iia)   such other instruments as may be declared by the Central Government to be securities and,
  (iii)     rights or interests in securities.

 INVESTMENT
Investment is the employment of funds on assets with the aim of earning income or capital appreciation.
Investment has two attributes namely time and risk. Present consumption is sacrificed to get a return in the

Security Analysis                                                                                          LESSON 18

future. The sacrifice that has to be borne is certain but the return in the future may be uncertain. This attribute of
investment indicates the risk factor. The risk is undertaken with a view to reap some return from the investment.
The investor makes a comparison of the returns available from each avenue of investment, the element of risk
involved in it and then makes the investment decision that he perceives to be the best having regard to the time
frame of the investment and his own risk profile.
Any investment decision will be influenced by three objectives – security, liquidity and yield. A best investment
decision will be one, which has the best possible compromise between these three objectives.
    l     Security
    l     Liquidity
    l     Yield
A best investment decision will be one, which has the best possible compromise between these three objectives.
When selecting where to invest our funds, we have to analyze and manage following three objectives.
   (i)    Security: Central to any investment objective is the certainty in recovery of the principal. One can afford
          to lose the returns at any given point of time, but s/he can ill afford to lose the very principal itself. By
          identifying the importance of security, we will be able to identify and select the instrument that meets
          this criterion. For example, when compared with corporate bonds, we can vouch the safety of return
          of investment in treasury bonds as we have more faith in governments than in corporations. Hence,
          treasury bonds are highly secured instruments. The safest investments are usually found in the money
          market and include such securities as Treasury bills (T-bills), certificates of deposit (CD), commercial
          paper or bankers’ acceptance slips; or in the fixed income (bond) market in the form of municipal and
          other government bonds, and in corporate bonds.
   (ii)   Liquidity : Because we may have to convert our investment back to cash or funds to meet our unexpected
          demands and needs, our investment should be highly liquid. They should be en cashable at short
          notice, without loss and without any difficulty. If they cannot come to our rescue, we may have to borrow
          or raise funds externally at high cost and at unfavorable terms and conditions. Such liquidity can be
          possible only in the case of investment, which has always-ready market and willing buyers and sellers.
          Such instruments of investment are called highly liquid investment. Common stock is often considered
          the most liquid of investments, since it can usually be sold within a day or two of the decision to sell.
          Bonds can also be fairly marketable, but some bonds are highly illiquid, or nontradable, possessing a
          fixed term. Similarly, money market instruments may only be redeemable at the precise date at which
          the fixed term ends. If an investor seeks liquidity, money market assets and non-tradable bonds aren’t
          likely to be held in his or her portfolio.
  (iii)   Yield: Yield is best described as the net return out of any investment. Hence given the level or kind
          of security and liquidity of the investment, the appropriate yield should encourage the investor to go
          for the investment. If the yield is low compared to the expectation of the investor, s/he may prefer to
          avoid such investment and keep the funds in the bank account or in worst case, in cash form in lockers.
          Hence yield is the attraction for any investment and normally deciding the right yield is the key to any
          investment.

 INVESTMENT VS. SPECULATION
According to Benjamin Graham “An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety
of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.”
Thus investment differs from speculation. Speculation also involves deployment of funds but it is not backed


                                                                                                                  729

by a conscious analysis of pros and cons. Mostly it is a spur of the moment activity that is promoted and
supported by half-baked information and rumours. Speculative deployment of funds is generally prevalent in
the secondary equity market. What attracts people to speculation is a rate of return that is abnormally higher
than the prevailing market rates. The balancing of risk and return nevertheless operates in speculative activity
also and as such the risk element in speculation is very high. Very broadly, the characteristics of an investor
differ from the speculator as follows:

Investment differs from gambling and betting also. Both gambling and betting are games of chance in which
return is dependent upon a particular event happening. Here also, there is no place for research-based activity.

To say that investors like return and dislike risk is, however, simplistic. To facilitate our job of analyzing securities
and portfolios within a risk return context, we must begin with a clear understanding of what risk and return are,
what creates them and how they should be measured.

 SECURITY ANALYSIS
Security analysis is the first part of investment decision process involving the valuation and analysis of individual
securities. Security Analysis is primarily concerned with the analysis of a security with a view to determine the
value of the security, so that appropriate decisions may be made based on such valuation as compared with
the value placed on the security in the market.
Two basic approaches of security analysis are fundamental analysis and technical analysis.

 Fundamental Analysis can be segregated into economic analysis, industry analysis and company
 analysis
Fundamental analysis is a three level systematic process that analyse the overall external and internal
environment of the company before placing a value on its shares. The three levels at which the analysis is
carried out are the following:
   (a)    Analysis of the economy
   (b)    Industry Level Analysis
   (c)    Company Analysis
We shall describe the analytical process at all these levels in details hereunder:

 Analysis of the economy
Performance of a company is intimately related to the overall economic environment of the country because
demand for products and services of the company would under normal circumstances be directly related to
growth of the country’s economy. If the country has an improving GDP growth rate, controlled inflation and
increasing investment activity then chances are that the valuation of securities shall be liberal. The capital
market is said to be in a bullish phase with share values shooting up across the board. As the economy is
growing, the analyst expects almost every industry to do well.
On the other hand, if the GDP growth rate slackens, inflation is out of control and investment activity is stagnant
or declining, the investor or the analyst will expect the performance of industries to slow down. Under such
circumstances, valuation of securities tends to be conservative. The capital market enters a bearish phase and
share values decline across to board.
While undertaking the analysis of the economy, the following macro-economic factors are commonly used.
    i)    Gross Domestic Product: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) indicates the rate of growth of the economy.
          GDP represents the aggregate value of the goods and services produced in the economy. GDP consists
          of personal consumption expenditure, gross private domestic investment and government expenditure
          on goods and services and net export of goods and services. As mentioned above, whenever the GDP
          grows, it indicates economic growth and higher return for investors.
   ii)    Savings and Investment: It is obvious that growth demands investment which in turn needs substantial
          amount of domestic savings. Stock market is a channel through which the savings of the investors
          are made available to corporate houses. Savings are distributed over different assets such as equity
          shares, deposits, mutual fund units, real estate and bullion.
   iii)   Inflation : Along with the growth rate of GDP, if the inflation rate also increases, then the real rate of

                                                                                                                    731
EP-CA&FM                                                                                             Security Analysis

          growth of would be very less. The demand in the consumer product industry is significantly affected.
          The industries which come under the government price control policy may lose the market. It is to be
          noted that mild level of inflation is good for the stock market and high rate of inflation is detrimental to
          the stock market.
   iii)   Interest rates: The interest rate affects the cost of financing to the firms. A decrease in interest rate
          implies lower cost of finance for firms and more profitability. More money is available at a lower interest
          rate for the brokers who are doing business with borrowed money. Availability of funds at low interest
          rates fosters speculation and rise in the price of shares.
   iv)    Budget: The Union Budget provides a detailed account of the government revenues and expenditures.
          A deficit budget may lead to high rate of inflation and adversely impact the cost of production. Surplus
          budgets may result in deflation. Hence, balance budget is highly favourable to the stock market.
   v)     Tax structure: Tax concessions and incentives given to certain industries encourages investment in that
          particular industry. Tax reliefs provided to savings encourage savings.
   vi)    Other factors: Other factors include the balance of payment, monsoon and agriculture, infrastructure
          facilities and demographic factors.

 Industry Level Analysis
Industry level analysis focuses on a particular industry rather than on the broader economy. In this analysis, the
analyst has to look for the composition of the industry, its criticality vis-à-vis the national economy, its position
along the industrial life cycle, entry and exit barriers. All these factors have a bearing upon the performance of
the company.
Industry is a combination or group of units whose end products and services are similar. Having a common
market, the participants in the industry group face similar problems and opportunities. To the extent that an
industry loses or gains from certain happenings, the performance of the participants is sure to be similarly
impacted. These happenings may be technological changes, shifts in consumer preferences, availability of
substitutes etc. These changes also drive the life cycle of the industry.
The industry life cycle or the industry growth cycle can be divided into three major stages-pioneering stage,
expansion stage and stagnation stage. The pioneering stage is related to sunrise status of the industry. It is the
stage when technological development takes places. The products have been newly introduced in the market
and they gain ready acceptance. The pioneering units in the industry make extraordinary profits and thus
attract competition. As competition increases profitability in the industry comes under strain and less efficient
firms are forced out of the market. At the end of the pioneering stage, selected leading companies remain in
the industry.
In the expansion stage of the growth cycle the demand for the products increases but at a lower rate. There is
less volatility in prices and production. Capital is easily available in plenty for these units. Due to retention of
profits, internal accruals increase.
At the stagnation stage, the growth rate initially slows down, then stagnates and ultimately turns negative.
There is no product innovation. External capital is hard to come by. Even the internal capital takes flight. This
stage of the industry is most valuable during times of slow down in national economy.

 Company Analysis
Armed with the economic and industry forecasts, the analyst looks at the company specific information.
Company information is generated internally and externally. The principle source of internal information
about a company is its financial statements. Quarterly and annual reports including the income statement, the

732
Security Analysis                                                                                      LESSON 18

balance sheet and cash flows must be screened to assure that the statements are correct, complete, consistent,
and comparable. Many popular and widely circulated sources of information about the companies emanate
from outside, or external sources. These sources provide supplements to company-generated information by
overcoming some of its bias, such as public pronouncements by its officers. External information sources also
provide certain kinds of information not found in the materials made available by companies themselves. There
are traditional and modern techniques of company analysis.
Among the traditional techniques are forecasting expected dividends and earnings using price-earning ratios
which help us to determine whether a stock is fairly valued at a point in time. Such approaches allow us to
evaluate an equity share for a short term horizon. Moreover, an approach combining the dividend discount
model (with variable growth rates) and the concept of systematic risk can also be helpful in evaluating a stock
for a longer term holding period. Among the modern methods are regression analysis, and the related tools of
trend and correlation analysis, decision tree analysis and simulation. Modern methods have strengths of the
traditional methods while attempting to overcoming their shortcomings.
Fundamental Analysis Tools: Although the raw data of the Financial Statement has some useful information,

At this juncture, it is imperative to understand various Ratios, Comparative Financial Statements, Trend Analysis,
Common Size Statements, Fund Flow Analysis and Cash Flow Analysis

 A. Ratio Analysis
Ratio is a relationship between two figures expressed mathematically. Financial ratio provides numerical
relationship between two relevant financial data. Financial ratios are calculated from the balance sheet and
profit and loss account.
Financial ratios may be divided into six groups
     -   Liquidity Ratios
     -   Turnover Ratios
     -   Leverage Ratios
     -   Profit Margin Ratios
     -   Coverage Ratios
     -   Valuation Ratios
a) Liquidity Ratios: Liquidity means the ability of the firm to meet its short term obligations. Current ratio and

                                                                                                              733
EP-CA&FM                                                                                              Security Analysis

acid test ratio are the most popular ratios used to analyse the liquidity. The liquidity ratio indicates the liquidity
in a rough fashion and the adequacy of the working capital.
      1.   Current Ratio: The current ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company’s ability to pay short-term
           obligations or those due within one year.
		 = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
   2.      Acid Test Ratio: The acid-test ratio (ATR), also commonly known as the quick ratio, measures the
           liquidity of a company by calculating how well current assets can cover current liabilities. The quick
           ratio uses only the most liquid current assets that can be converted to cash within 90 days or less.
		 = Current Assets – Inventories / Current Liabilities
b) Turnover Ratios: The turnover ratios show how well the assets are used and the extent of excess inventory, if
any. These ratios are also known as activity ratios or asset management ratios. Commonly calculated ratios are
sales to current assets, sales to fixed assets, sales to inventory, receivable to sales and total assets to turnover.
Sales to current assets ratio shows the utilisation of current assets. Various turnover ratios are as under:
      1.   Inventory Turnover Ratio: Inventory turnover is the rate that inventory stock is sold, or used, and
           replaced. The inventory turnover ratio is calculated by dividing the cost of goods by average inventory
           for the same period. A higher ratio tends to point to strong sales and a lower one to weak sales.
		 = Net Sales / Inventory or
		 Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory.
   2.      Receivables Turnover Ratio: The receivables turnover ratio measures the efficiency with which
           a company is able to collect on its receivables or the credit it extends to customers. The ratio also
           measures how many times a company’s receivables are converted to cash in a certain period of time.
		 = Net Credit Sales / Average Accounts Receivable
   3.      Capital Employed Turnover Ratio: The capital employed turnover ratio indicates the efficiency with
           which a company utilizes its capital employed with reference to sales.
		 = Net Sales / Average Capital Employed
   4.      Working Capital Turnover Ratio: Working capital turnover ratio is the ratio between the net revenue or
           turnover of a business and its working capital.
		 = Net Sales / Working Capital
   5.      Asset Turnover Ratio: Asset turnover ratio is the ratio between the value of a company’s sales or
           revenues and the value of its assets. It is an indicator of the efficiency with which a company is deploying
           its assets to produce the revenue. Thus, asset turnover ratio can be a determinant of a company’s
           performance.
		 = Net Sales / Average Total Assets
c) Leverage Ratios: The investors are generally interested to find out the debt portion of the capital. The debt
affects the dividend payment because of the outflow of profit in the form of interest. High leverage indicates
significance reliance on external debt financing sources. Low leverage signifies operations are mostly funded
with internally generated cash (retained earnings).
The financial leverage affects the risk and return aspects of holding the shares. In general, increased amounts
of leverage in the capital structure equates to more financial risk, since the company incurs greater interest

Security Analysis                                                                                       LESSON 18

expense and mandatory debt amortization as well as principal repayments coming up in the future. Various
leverage ratios are as under:

    1.   Debt-to-Assets Ratio: The debt-to-assets ratio compares a company’s total debt to its assets, with a
         higher value meaning that the company has purchased the majority of its assets using debt.
		 Debt-to-Assets Ratio = Total Debt / Total Assets
   2.    Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E): The debt-to-equity ratio compares a company’s debt to the shareholders’
         equity, with a high ratio suggesting the company’s operations have been financed with more debt.
		 Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E) = Total Debt / Total Equity
   3.    Debt-to-Total Capitalization: The debt-to-capital ratio compares the total debt to the sum of all capital
         sources, with the purpose of measuring the percentage of the total capital structure attributable to debt.
		 Debt-to-Total Capitalization = Total Debt / (Debt + Equity + Minority Interest + Preferred Stock)
   4.    Net Debt-to-Total Capitalization: The inherent assumption in the net debt-to-capital ratio is that the
         cash on the B/S can be used to help pay down existing debt – thus the total debt amount is adjusted to
         account for the available cash balance.
		 Net Debt-to-Capital = (Total Debt – Cash) / (Debt + Equity + Minority Interest + Preferred Stock – Cash)
   5.    Operating Leverage Ratio: The degree of operating leverage (DOL) is a financial ratio that measures
         the sensitivity of a company’s operating income to its sales. This financial metric shows how a change
         in the company’s sales will affect its operating income.
		 DOL = (Sales – Variable Costs) / Profit
		 Where Profit can be calculated using the following formula,
		 Profit= Sales – Variable Costs – Fixed Costs
   6.    Financial Leverage Ratio: Just as operating leverage results from the existence of operating expenses
         in the enterprise’s income stream, financial leverage results from the presence of fixed financial
         charges in the firm’s income stream. Financial leverage is the use of debt to buy more assets. Leverage
         is employed to increase the return on equity. However, an excessive amount of financial leverage
         increases the risk of failure, since it becomes more difficult to repay debt.
		 The degree of financial leverage (DFL) is a leverage ratio that measures the sensitivity of a company’s
   earnings per share to fluctuations in its operating income, as a result of changes in its capital structure.
   This ratio indicates that the higher the degree of financial leverage, the more volatile earnings will be.
		 DFL = (EBIT) / (EBT)
d) Profitability Ratios: Profitability ratios are a class of financial metrics that are used to assess a business’s
ability to generate earnings relative to its revenue, operating costs, balance sheet assets, or shareholders’
equity over time, using data from a specific point in time.
Profitability ratios can be compared with efficiency ratios, which consider how well a company uses its assets
internally to generate income (as opposed to after-cost profits). Profitability ratios assess a company’s ability to
earn profits from its sales or operations, balance sheet assets, or shareholders’ equity.
Profitability ratios indicate how efficiently a company generates profit and value for shareholders. Higher ratio
results are often more favourable, but these ratios provide much more information when compared to results of
similar companies, the company’s own historical performance, or the industry average.



                                                                                                                735
EP-CA&FM                                                                                              Security Analysis

The following are covered under the profitability ratios:
      1.   Gross Profit Margin: The Gross Margin Ratio, also known as the gross profit margin ratio, is a profitability
           ratio that compares the gross margin of a company to its revenue. It shows how much profit a company
           makes after paying off its Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).
		 Gross Profit Margin = Gross Profit / Net Sales * 100
		Where,
		 Gross Profit = Net Sales – Cost of Goods Sold
		 Net Sales = Total Sales – Discounts – Allowances – Sales Returns
   2.      Operating Profit Margin: Operating Profit Margin helps measure the company’s ability to maintain
           operating expenses to generate profit before interest expense and tax deduction. In other words, the
           revenue that remains after costs is deducted from net sales.
		 A higher ratio indicates that the company is well equipped to pay its fixed costs, interest obligations,
   handle economic slowdowns and also offer lower prices than its competitors at lower margins. Moreover,
   the company management most frequently uses this to improve profitability by managing its costs.
		 Operating Profit Margin Ratio = Operating Profit / Net Sales * 100
		Where,
		 Operating Profit = Gross Profit – Operating Expenses – Depreciation and Amortisation
		 Net Sales = Total Sales – Discounts – Allowances – Sales Returns
   3.      Net Profit Margin: The net profit margin, or simply net margin, measures how much net income or
           profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It is the ratio of net profits to revenues for a company or
           business segment. Net profit margin is typically expressed as a percentage but can also be represented
           in decimal form. The net profit margin illustrates how much of each dollar /rupee in revenue collected
           by a company translates into profit.
		 Net Profit Margin Ratio = Net Income / Net Sales * 100
		Where,
		 Net Income = Gross Profit – All Expenses – Interest – Taxes
		 Net Sales = Total Sales – Discounts – Allowances – Sales Returns
   4.      Return on Equity (ROE): ROE measures how well a company can use its shareholders’ money to
           generate profits. Also, it indicates the returns on the sum of money the investors have invested in the
           company.
		 Furthermore, ROE is usually watched by investors and analysts. Moreover, a higher ROE ratio can be
   one of the reasons to buy a company’s stock. Companies with a high return on equity can generate
   cash internally, and thus they will be less dependent on debt financing.
		 Return on Equity = Net Profit after Taxes / Shareholder’s Equity x 100
		Where,
		 Shareholder’s Equity = Equity Share Capital
   5.      Return on Assets (ROA): Return on Assets (ROA) measures how well a company uses its assets to
           generate profits. In other words, it focuses on how much profit it generates on every rupee invested.


736
Security Analysis                                                                                        LESSON 18

         Also, it measures the asset intensity of the company. Thus, a lower ROA indicates a more asset-intensive
         company.
		 On the contrary, a higher ROA indicates more profitability against the company’s number of assets to
   operate. Moreover, companies with higher asset intensity must invest a significant amount in machinery
   and equipment to generate income. For example – telecommunication, car manufacturers, railroads,
   etc.
		 Return on Assets = Net Profit after Taxes / Total Assets x 100
		Where,
		 Total assets = All the assets on the balance sheet
   6.    Return on Capital Employed (ROCE): Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) measures the company’s
         overall return against the overall investment of both shareholders and bondholders. This ratio is very
         similar to ROE, but it is more comprehensive as it includes the returns generated from bondholders
         capital investments.
		 Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) = EBIT / Capital Employed
		Where,
		 EBIT (Earnings Before Interest & Taxes) = Net Profit Before Interest and Taxes
		 Capital Employed = Total Assets – Current Liabilities
e) Coverage Ratios: A coverage ratio, broadly, is a metric intended to measure a company’s ability to service its
debt and meet its financial obligations, such as interest payments or dividends. The higher the coverage ratio,
the easier it should be to make interest payments on its debt or pay dividends.
The most common coverage ratios are:
    1.   Interest coverage ratio: The ability of a company to pay the interest expense (only) on its debt.
		 = Operating Income / Interest Expense.
   2.    Debt service coverage ratio: The ability of a company to pay all debt obligations, including repayment
         of principal and interest.
		 = Operating Income / Total Debt Service
   3.    Cash coverage ratio: The ability of a company to pay interest expense with its cash balance.
		 = Total Cash / Interest Expense
   4.    Asset coverage ratio: The ability of a company to repay its debt obligations with its assets.
		 = (Total Assets – Intangible Assets) – (Current Liabilities- Short-term Debts) / Interest Expense
f) Valuation Ratios or Market Value Ratios: Valuation ratios, or market value ratios, are measurements of how
appropriately shares in a company are valued and what type of return an investor may get. By calculating the
market value, a potential investor can see if the shares are overvalued, undervalued, or at a fair price.
    1.   Price- to -Earnings Ratio: Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) looks at the relationship between a company’s
         stock price and its earnings. The P/E ratio gives investors an idea of what the market is willing to pay
         for the company’s earnings. The ratio is determined by dividing a company’s current share price by its
         earnings per share.
		 Companies with a high Price Earnings Ratio are often considered to be growth stocks. This indicates a


                                                                                                              737
EP-CA&FM                                                                                          Security Analysis

        positive future performance, and investors have higher expectations for future earnings growth and are
        willing to pay more for them.
		 Companies with a low Price Earnings Ratio are often considered to be value stocks. It means they are
   undervalued because their stock prices trade lower relative to their fundamentals. This mispricing will
   be a great bargain and will prompt investors to buy the stock before the market corrects it.
		 P/E = Stock Price Per Share / Earnings Per Share
		or
		 P/E = Market Capitalization / Total Net Earnings
		or
		 Justified P/E = Dividend Payout Ratio / R – G
		where;
		 R = Required Rate of Return
		 G = Sustainable Growth Rate
   2.   Price-to-Book Value Ratio: Price-to-book value (P/B) is a measurement that looks at the value the
        market places on the book value of the company. It is calculated by taking the current price per share
        and dividing by the book value per share. The book value of a company is the difference between the
        balance sheet assets and balance sheet liabilities. A ratio over 1 generally implies that the market is
        willing to pay more than the equity per share, while a ratio under 1 implies that the market is willing to
        pay less.
		      The P/B ratio reflects the value that market participants attach to a company’s equity relative to the book
        value of its equity. A stock’s market value is a forward-looking metric that reflects a company’s future
        cash flows. The book value of equity is an accounting measure based on the historic cost principle and
        reflects past issuances of equity, augmented by any profits or losses, and reduced by dividends and
        share buybacks.

                        Market Price per Share
        P/B Ratio =
                        Book Value per Share
   3.   Price-to-Sales Ratio: The price-to-sales ratio (P/S) shows how much the market values every dollar
        of the company’s sales. To calculate it, take the company’s market capitalization and divide it by the
        company’s total sales over the past 12 months. A company’s market cap is the number of shares issued
        multiplied by the share price. The P/S ratio can be used in place of the P/E ratio in situations where the
        company has a net loss.
		 One of the advantages of using the P/S ratio is that sales are much harder to manipulate than earnings.
   Since a company’s sales are generally more stable than its earnings level, any large changes in the
   P/S ratio are often more likely to indicate a departure from the intrinsic value of the company (either up
   or down).

                      MVS
        P/S Ratio =
                      SPS
		Where:
		 MVS = Market Value per Share
		 SPS = Sales per Share

Security Analysis                                                                                     LESSON 18

   4.   Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio: Price-to-cash flow ratio (P/CF) evaluates the price of a company’s stock
        relative to how much cash flow the company generates. It is calculated by dividing the company’s
        market cap by its operating cash flow in the most recent 12 months. It can also be calculated by dividing
        the per-share stock price by the per-share operating cash flow. P/CF ratio is an alternative method to
        P/E ratio.
		 Many investors prefer to use a P/CF metric because it is considered harder to manipulate cash tallies
   than it would be to massage earnings reports under generally accepted accounting principles, which
   could make the cash-based benchmark a more reliable indicator.

                                                 Share Price
         Price-to-Cash Flow Ratio =
                                        Operating Cash Flow per Share
   5.   Price/earnings-to-growth (PEG): Price/earnings-to-growth ratio is the relationship between the P/E
        ratio and the projected earnings growth of a company. It is calculated by dividing the P/E ratio by the
        earnings-per-share growth. For example, if a company’s P/E ratio is 16.5 and its earnings-per-share
        growth over the next 3 years is expected to be 10.8%, its PEG ratio would be 1.5.
		 A PEG of 1 or less is typically taken to indicate that the company is undervalued. A PEG of more than 1
   is typically taken to indicate that the company is overvalued. To get a clearer picture of value, the PEG
   of the company should also be compared with the PEG of the market and with the industry that the
   company competes in.

                          Price / EPS
         PEG Ratio =
                         EPS Growth
		Where:
		 EPS = The earnings per share.
(Note: For more details on ratio analysis, please refer to Lesson 8- Financial Statement Analysis covered
under the Corporate Accounting portion).

 B. Comparative Financial Statements
In the comparative financial statements balance sheet figures are provided for more than one year. The
comparative financial statement provides time perspective to the balance sheet figures. The annual data are
compared with similar data of previous years, either in absolute terms or in percentages.

 C. Trend Analysis
In trend analysis percentages are calculated with a base year. This would provide insight into the growth or
decline of the sale or profit over the years. Sometimes sales may be increasing continuously, and the inventories
may also be rising. This would indicate the loss of market share of the particular company’s product. Likewise
sales may have an increasing trend but profits may remain the same. Here the investor has to look into the cost
and management efficiency of the company.

 D. Common size statement
A common size financial statement displays line items as a percentage of one selected or common figure.
Creating common size financial statements makes it easier to analyze a company over time and compare it
with its peers. Using common size financial statements helps you spot trends that a raw financial statement may
not uncover.
All three of the primary financial statements can be put into a common size format. Financial statements in
dollar amounts can easily be converted to common size statements using a spreadsheet. Below is an overview
of each financial statement and a more detailed summary of the benefits and drawbacks that such an analysis
can provide to you.
Balance Sheet Analysis
The common figure for a common size balance sheet analysis is total assets. Based on the accounting equation,
this also equals total liabilities and shareholders’ equity, making either term interchangeable in the analysis.
It is also possible to use total liabilities to indicate where a company’s obligations lie and whether it is being
conservative or risky in managing its debts.
The common size strategy from a balance sheet perspective lends insight into a firm’s capital structure and how
it compares to its rivals. You can also look to determine an optimal capital structure for a given industry and
compare it to the firm being analysed. Then, you can conclude whether the debt level is too high, excess cash is
being retained on the balance sheet, or inventories are growing too high. The goodwill level on a balance sheet
also helps indicate the extent to which a company has relied on acquisitions for growth.
Analysing the Income Statement
The common figure for an income statement is total top-line sales. This is actually the same analysis as
calculating a company’s margins. For instance, a net profit margin is simply net income divided by sales, which
also happens to be a common size analysis.
The same goes for calculating gross and operating margins. The common size method is appealing for research-
intensive companies, for example, because they tend to focus on research and development (R&D) and what it
represents as a percent of total sales.
Taking the example of Apple Inc. to understand the concept and see the trend in the financials of the last three
years.

Advantages of Common Size Income Statement Analysis
      i)    A helps a financial user to understand the income statement more clearly in terms of the ratio or
            percentage of each item in the income statement as a percentage of the company’s total sales.
      ii)   It helps an analyst ascertain the trend concerning the percentage share of each item on the income
            statement and its impact on the company’s net income.
   iii)     A financial analyst can use a common-size income statement to compare the financial performances of
            different entities at a glance since each item is expressed in terms of the percentage of total sales.
Disadvantages of Common Size Income Statement Analysis
      i)    Many financial experts see the common size income statement as useless because there isn’t any
            approved standard proportion of each item to the total sales.
      ii)   If year after year preparation of a particular company’s income statement is not consistent, then
            performing any comparative study of common size statement income statements may end up being
            misleading

 E. Fund Flow Analysis
The balance sheet gives a static picture of the company’s position on a particular data. It does not disclose the
changes that have occurred in the financial position of the unit over a period of time. The investor should know,
   a)       How are the profits utilized?
   b)       Financial source of dividend.
   c)       Source of fiancé for capital expenditure.
   d)       Source of finance for repayment of debts.
   e)       The destiny of the sale proceeds of the fixed assets and
      f)    Use of the proceeds of the share or debenture issue or fixed deposits raised from public.

These items of information are provided in the funds flow statement. It is a statement of the sources and
application of funds. It highlights the changes in the financial condition of a business enterprise between two
balance sheet dates.
The investor could see clearly the amount of funds generated or lost in operations. He could see how these
funds have divided into three significant uses like taxes, dividends and reserves.
Moreover, the application of long term funds towards the acquisition of current assets can be found out. This
would reveal the real picture of the financial position of the company.

 F. Cash Flow Statement
The investor is interested in knowing the cash inflow and outflow of the enterprise. The cash flow statement is
prepared with the help of balance sheet, income statement and some additional information. It can be either
prepared in the vertical form or in the horizontal form. Cash flows related to operations and other transactions
are computed. The statement shows the causes of changes in cash movements over an operating cycle. The
factors responsible for the reduction of cash balances in spite of increase in profits or vice versa are ascertained.

 TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
In the fundamental analysis, share prices are predicted on the basis of a three stage analysis. After the analysis
has been completed, the deciding factors that emerge are the financial performance indicators like earnings
and dividends of the company. The fundamentalist makes a judgement of the equity share value with a risk
return framework based upon the earning power and the economic environment. However, in actual practice,
it often happens that a share having sound fundamentals refuses to rise in value and vice versa. We would
now examine an alternative approach to predict share price behavior. This approach is called the Technical
Analysis. It is used in conjunction with fundamental analysis and not as its substitute.

Technical analysis is an analysis for forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data,
primarily price and volume. This Technique assumes market prices of securities are determined by the demand-
supply equilibrium. The shifts in this equilibrium give rise to certain patterns of price and volume of trading which
have a tendency to repeat themselves over a period of time. An analyst who is familiar with these patterns can
predict the future behaviour of stock prices by noticing the formation of these patterns. These predictions are
indicative and do not provide irrefutable declarations about future trends. In this type of analysis, no weightage
is given to intangible items like investors’ attitude, market sentiment, optimism, pessimism etc.

Technical analysis is based on the following assumptions:

      –   The inter-play of demand and supply determines the market value of shares.

      –   Supply and demand are governed by various factors – both rational and irrational.

      –   Stock values tend to move in trends that persist for a reasonable time.

      –   These trends change as a result of change in demand-supply equilibrium.

      –   Shifts in demand and supply can be detected in charts of market action.

      –   Chart patterns tend to repeat themselves and this repetition can be used to forecast future price
          movements.

      –   Markets behave in a random style.

      –   Markets discount every future event that has a bearing upon share values.

 DOW JONES THEORY
It is one of the earliest theories of technical analysis. The theory was formulated by Charles H. Dow of Dow Jones
& Co. who was the first editor of Wall street Journal of USA. According to this theory, share prices demonstrate
a pattern over four to five years.

These patterns can be divided into three distinct cyclical trends- primary, secondary or intermediate and minor
trends.

 Primary Trends
The primary trend lasts from one to three years. Over this period, the markets exhibit definite upward or
downward movement which is punctuated by shorter spans of trend reversal in the opposite directions. The
trend reversal is called the secondary trend. Primary trend is indicative of the overall pattern of movement.

In Dow theory, the primary trend is the major trend of the market, which makes it the most important one to
determine. This is because the overriding trend is the one that affects the movements in stock prices. The
primary trend will also impact the secondary and minor trends within the market.

If the primary trend is upward, it is called a bullish phase of the market. If the primary trend is downwards, it is
called a bearish phase. Illustrations of bullish phase and bearish phase are given below:

 Graph of Bullish Phase




In a bullish phase, after each peak, there is a fall but the subsequent rise is higher than the previous one. The
prices reach higher level with each rise. After the peak has been reached, the primary trend now turns to a
bearish phase.

                                                                                                                751
EP-CA&FM                                                                                              Security Analysis

In a bearish phase, the overall trend is that of decline in share values. After each fall, there is slight rise but the
subsequent fall is even sharper.

 Secondary Trends
In Dow theory, a primary trend is the main direction in which the market is moving. Conversely, a secondary
trend moves in the opposite direction of the primary trend, or as a correction to the primary trend.
For example, an upward primary trend will be composed of secondary downward trends. This is the movement
from a consecutively higher high to a consecutively lower high. In a primary downward trend the secondary
trend will be an upward move, or a rally. This is the movement from a consecutively lower low to a consecutively
higher low.
In general, a secondary, or intermediate, trend typically lasts between three weeks and three months, while
the retracement of the secondary trend generally ranges between one-third to two-thirds of the primary trend’s
movement.

 Minor Trend
The last of the three trend types in Dow theory is the minor trend, which is defined as a market movement
lasting less than three weeks. Minor trends are changes occurring every day within a narrow range. These
trends are not decisive of any major movement. The minor trend is generally the corrective moves within a
secondary move, or those moves that go against the direction of the secondary trend.

 TOOLS OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
The two variables concerning groups of securities or individual securities that technicians watch are the behavior
of prices and volume of trading contributing to and influenced by changing prices. Technical analysts use two
major types of tools for their analysis. These are the charts and the price indicators.

 1. TECHNICAL CHARTS
These are the plottings of prices and trading volumes on charts. The purpose of reading and analysing these
charts is to determine the demand-supply equation at various levels and thus to predict the direction and extent
of future movement of the prices. The charts are not infallible but because of their repeated accuracy, they
have come to be accepted. In all the charts, a correlation exists between market price action and the volume
of trading when the price increase is accompanied by a surge in trading volumes, it is a sure sign of strength.
On the other hand, when the decline in share prices is accompanied by increased volumes, it is indicative of
beginning of bearish trend.
There are four ways to construct a chart. These are Line Chart, Bar Chart, Candle Stick Chart and Point & Figure
Chart.

 Line Chart
A Line chart is a style of chart that is created by connecting a series of data points together with a line. This is
the most basic type of chart used in finance and it is generally created by connecting a series of past prices
together with a line. Line charts are the most basic type of chart because it represents only the closing prices
over a set period. The line is formed by connecting the closing prices for each period over the timeframe and
the intra-period highs and lows of stock prices are ignored. This type of chart is useful for making broad analysis
over a longer period of time.

 Bar Chart
Bar charts expand upon the line chart by adding the open, high, low, and close – or the daily price range, in
other words – to the mix. The chart is made up of a series of vertical lines that represent the price range for a
given period with a horizontal dash on each side that represents the open and closing prices. The opening price
is the horizontal dash on the left side of the horizontal line and the closing price is located on the right side of
the line. If the opening price is lower than the closing price, the line is often shaded black to represent a rising
period. The opposite is true for a falling period, which is represented by a red shade.

 Candlestick Charts
Like a bar chart, candlestick charts have a thin vertical line showing the price range for a given period that is
shaded different colors based on whether the stock ended higher or lower. The difference is a wider bar or
rectangle that represents the difference between the opening and closing prices.
Falling periods will typically have a red or black candlestick body, while rising periods will have a white or
clear candlestick body. Days where the open and closing prices are the same will not have any wide body or
rectangle at all.

 Point and Figure Charts
In this type of charts, emphasis is laid on charting price changes only and time and volume elements are
ignored. The first step in drawing a figure and point chart is to put a X in the appropriate price column of a graph.
Successive price increases are added vertically upwards in the same column as long as the uptrend continues.
Once the price drops, the figures are moved to another column and Os are entered in downward series till the
downward trend is reversed.

 Patterns created by charts
Once the charts have been constructed, analysts seek to locate certain indicators/patterns in the charts. The
common patterns are being described below:


                                                                                                         755
EP-CA&FM                                                                                             Security Analysis

1. Support and resistance levels
A support level indicates the bottom which the share values are unable to pierce. After rising time and again,
the share price dips to a particular level and then starts rising again. At this level, the share gets buying support.
A resistance level is that level after which the share price refuses to move up in repeated efforts. At this level,
selling emerges. Support and resistance levels are valid for a particular time period. Once these levels are
breached, beginning of a new bull or bear phase is signaled.




2. Heads and Shoulders configuration
In this type of chart configuration, a formation similar to heads and shoulders is created wherein the neckline
acts as the resistance or support line. As the head and shoulder top is formed, a resistance level appears at the
top of the head. The volumes start declining near the head top and reversal sets in. The volumes become heavy
again and shrink near the neckline where another reversal of trend begins.

3. Triangle or coil formation
This pattern represents a pattern of uncertainty. Hence it is difficult to predict which way the price will break out.




4. Double Top Formation
It represents a bearish development, signaling that the price is expected to fall.
5. Double bottom formation
It represents a bullish development, signaling that the price is expected to rise.




 Limitations of charts
Interpretation of charts is prone to subjective analysis. This factor is a major cause of often contradictory analysis
being derived from the same charts. Also the changes in charts are quite frequent in the short term perspective
leading to a host of buy and sell recommendations which are not in the best interest of the investor. Another
disadvantage is that decisions are made on the basis of chart alone and other factors are ignored.

 2. TECHNICAL INDICATORS
Apart from the charts, technical analysts use a number of indicators generated from prices of stocks to finalise
their recommendations. These indicators are often used in conjunction with charts. Some of the important

                                                                                                                 757
EP-CA&FM                                                                                             Security Analysis

indicators are the Advance Decline Ratio, the Market Breadth Index and Moving Averages.

 (a) Advance-Decline Ratio
It is the ratio of the number of stocks that increase to the number of stocks that have declined. If the ratio is more
than one, the trend is assumed to be bullish. If the ratio starts declining, a change of trend is signaled.

 (b) Market Breadth Index
This index is a variation of the Advance-Decline Ratio. This index is computed by taking the difference between
the number of stocks rising and the number of stocks falling. If during a month, 400 out of 1000 stocks in the
market have risen and 300 have declined while 300 have remained unchanged, then market breadth would
be calculated as
= 2(400–300)/300. The figure of each time period is added to the previous period. If market breadth is increasing
along with rise in stock indices, it confirms the bullish trend and vice cersa.

 (c) Moving Averages
A moving average is the average of share values of a set of consecutive number of days. If we have to calculate
50 days moving average, we calculate the average for days 1–50. Then on day 51, we add the value of day 51
and deduct the value of day 1 and so on . Similarly, moving averages for 100 days, 200 days and 300 days can
be calculated. Moving averages provide a benchmark for future valuation. If share value is below the moving
average, it has scope for appreciation. If the value is above the moving average, the upside is limited in the
near term.

 (d) Relative Strength Index
The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed
and magnitude of a security’s recent price changes to evaluate overvalued or undervalued conditions in the
price of that security.
The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph) on a scale of zero to 100. The indicator was developed by J.
Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.
The RSI can do more than point to overbought and oversold securities. It can also indicate securities that may
be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price. It can signal when to buy and sell. Traditionally,
an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought situation. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold
condition.
As a momentum indicator, the relative strength index compares a security’s strength on days when prices go
up to its strength on days when prices go down. Relating the result of this comparison to price action can give
traders an idea of how a security may perform. The RSI, used in conjunction with other technical indicators, can
help traders make better-informed trading decisions.
The RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula:

                                                               100
                                                RSI = 100 -

                                                    Average Loss Per Day

The RSI can be calculated for any number of days depending on the wish of the technical analyst and the time
frame of trading adopted in a particular stock market. RSI is calculated for 5,7,9 and 14 days. If the period taken
is more, the possibility of getting wrong signals is reduced. Reactionary or sustained rise or fall in the price of
the scrip is foretold by the RSI.

The broad rule is, if the RSI crosses seventy there may be downturn and it is time to sell. If the RSI falls below
thirty it is time to pick up the scrip.

 (e) Aroon Indicator
The Aroon indicator is a technical indicator that is used to identify trend changes in the price of an asset, as well
as the strength of that trend. In essence, the indicator measures the time between highs and the time between
lows over a time period. The idea is that strong uptrends will regularly see new highs, and strong downtrends
will regularly see new lows. The indicator signals when this is happening, and when it isn’t.
The indicator consists of the “Aroon up” line, which measures the strength of the uptrend, and the “Aroon down”
line, which measures the strength of the downtrend. The Aroon indicator was developed by Tushar Chande in
1995.

                                                             25
The Aroon calculation requires the tracking of the high and low prices, typically over 25 periods.
      1.   Track the highs and lows for the last 25 periods on an asset.
   2.      Note the number of periods since the last high and low.
   3.      Plug these numbers into the Up and Down Aroon formulas.
The Aroon Up and the Aroon Down lines fluctuate between zero and 100, with values close to 100 indicating a
strong trend and values near zero indicating a weak trend. The lower the Aroon Up, the weaker the uptrend and
the stronger the downtrend, and vice versa. The main assumption underlying this indicator is that a stock’s price
will close regularly at new highs during an uptrend, and regularly make new lows in a downtrend.
The indicator focuses on the last 25 periods, but is scaled to zero and 100. Therefore, an Aroon Up reading
above 50 means the price made a new high within the last 12.5 periods. A reading near 100 means a high was
seen very recently. The same concepts apply to the Down Aroon. When it is above 50, a low was witnessed
within the 12.5 periods. A Down reading near 100 means a low was seen very recently.
Crossovers can signal entry or exit points. Up crossing above Down can be a signal to buy. Down crossing
below Up may be a signal to sell. When both indicators are below 50 it can signal that the price is consolidating.
New highs or lows are not being created. Traders can watch for breakouts as well as the next Aroon crossover
to signal which direction price is going.

 (f) Price Rate of Change
The Price Rate of Change (ROC) is a momentum-based technical indicator that measures the percentage
change in price between the current price and the price a certain number of periods ago. The ROC indicator is
plotted against zero, with the indicator moving upwards into positive territory if price changes are to the upside,
and moving into negative territory if price changes are to the downside.
Thus, The Price Rate of Change (ROC) oscillator is an unbounded momentum indicator used in technical analysis
set against a zero-level midpoint. A rising ROC above zero typically confirms an uptrend while a falling ROC
below zero indicates a downtrend. When the price is consolidating, the ROC will hover near zero. In this case, it
is important traders watch the overall price trend since the ROC will provide little insight except for confirming
the consolidation.

 RISK AND ITS TYPES
Risk in security analysis is generally associated with the possibility that the realized returns will be less than
the returns that were expected. In finance, different types of risk can be classified under two main groups, viz.,
systematic risk and unsystematic risk.

   A.    Systematic risk.

   B.    Unsystematic risk.

 A. Systematic Risk
Those forces that are uncontrollable, external and broad in their effect are called sources of systematic
risk. Systematic risk is due to the influence of external factors on an organization. Such factors are normally
uncontrollable from an organization’s point of view. Systematic risk is a macro in nature as it affects a large
number of organizations operating under a similar stream or same domain. It cannot be planned by the
organization.

In this way economic, political and sociological changes are sources of systematic risk. For example, if an
economy moves into recession or if there is a political upheaval, it will cause the prices of nearly all the
securities, whether bond or equity to decline.

Firms with high systematic risk tend to be those whose sales, profits and stock prices follow the general trend in
the level of economic or stock market activity. These may include companies that deal in basic industrial goods
like automobile manufactures.

The types of systematic risk are depicted and listed below.




    1.   Interest rate risk,

   2.    Market risk and

    3.   Purchasing power or inflationary risk.

Now let’s discuss each risk classified under this group.

1. Interest rate risk

Interest-rate risk is the variation in the single period rates of return caused by the fluctuations in the market
interest rate. It particularly affects debt securities as they carry the fixed rate of interest.



                                                                                                              761

2. Market risk

Market risk is associated with consistent fluctuations seen in the trading price of any particular shares or
securities. That is, it arises due to rise or fall in the trading price of listed shares or securities in the stock market.

3. Purchasing power or inflationary risk

Purchasing power risk is also known as inflation risk. It is so, since it emanates (originates) from the fact
that it affects a purchasing power adversely. It is not desirable to invest in securities during an inflationary
period.

 B. Unsystematic Risk
Unsystematic risk is due to the influence of internal factors prevailing within an organization. Such factors
are controllable, internal factors which are peculiar to a particular industry or firm/(s). It may be because of
change in management, labour strikes which will impact the returns of only specific firms which are facing the
problem.

It is a micro in nature as it affects only a particular organization. It can be planned, so that necessary actions
can be taken by the organization to mitigate (reduce the effect of) the risk.

Higher proportion of unsystematic risk is found in firms producing non durable consumer goods. Examples
include suppliers of telephone, power and food stuffs.

The types of unsystematic risk are depicted and listed below.




      1.   Business or liquidity risk,

    2.     Financial or credit risk

Now let’s discuss each risk classified under this group.

1. Business or liquidity risk

Business risk is also known as liquidity risk. It is so, since it emanates (originates) from the sale and purchase of
securities affected by business cycles, technological changes, etc.

2. Financial or credit risk

Financial risk is also known as credit risk. It arises due to change in the capital structure of the organization. The
capital structure mainly comprises of three ways by which funds are sourced for the projects.

 RETURN OF THE SECURITY
Return is the primary motivating force that drives investment. It represents the reward for undertaking investment.
One of the important property of a security that the investors are concerned with is the return that can be
expected from holding a security. Earning a return on an investment requires a passage of time. After some
time has passed, one may make an objective measurement of the rate of an investment return that has been
achieved. The word “return” can be misleading, since no single measure of return can answer all possible
questions regarding results. The reasons lie in the fact that taxes, inflation, commissions, and the timing of cash
flows all play major roles in “correct” calculation of returns.
The return of an investment consists of two components:
Current Return – The first component that comes to mind when one is thinking about return is the periodic cash
flow (income), such as dividend or interest, generated by the investment. Current return is measured as the
periodic income in relation to the beginning price of the investment.
Capital Return – The second component of return is reflected in the price change called the capital return – it is
simply the price appreciation (or depreciation) divided by the beginning price of the asset. For assets like equity
stocks, the capital return predominates.
Thus, the total return for any security is defined as:
                                   Total return = Current return + Capital return
The current return can be zero or positive, whereas the capital return can be negative, zero or positive.

 MEASURING RETURN
Total return, or holding period return (r), is perhaps the best unique, rational and comparable measures of
results, no matter what type of asset is under discussion. Holding period return is the total return received from
holding an asset or portfolio of assets over a period of time, generally expressed as a percentage. Holding
period return is calculated on the basis of total returns from the asset or portfolio – i.e. income plus changes in
value. It is particularly useful for comparing returns between investments held for different period of time.

                                                                                                               763
EP-CA&FM                                                                                                           Security Analysis

Holding Period Return (HPR) and annualized HPR for returns over multiple years can be calculated as follows:
Holding Period Return = Income + (End of Period Value – Initial Value) / Initial Value
Annualized HPR = {[(Income + (End of Period Value – Initial Value)] / Initial Value+ 1}1/n – 1, where n = number of
years.
Returns for regular time periods such as quarters or years can be converted to a holding period return through
the following formula:
(1 + HPR) = (1 + r1) x (1 + r2) x (1 + r3) x (1 + r4) where r1, r2, r3 and r4 are periodic returns. Thus,
Example 1:
                                           HPR = [(1 + r1) x (1 + r2) X ... (1 + rn)] – 1
                                                   r = % return per period
                                                    n = number of periods
Mr. A invested Rs. 10,000 in shares of XYZ Company 10 years ago, and that your shares (including reinvested
dividends) are currently worth Rs. 23,800. Using this information, calculate total investment return of Mr. A.

                                                        Rs.23,800 − Rs.10,000
                      Total investment return =                                             = 1.38 (or 138%)
                                                                Rs.10,000
So, total return over a decade has been 138%. Since we’re considering a 10-year period, we will use (1/10) i.e. 0.1
as power to calculate the annualized return:
Annualised return = (1 + 1.38)0.1 – 1 = 0.0906
Translated to a percentage, this shows that Mr. A’s 10-year investment in XYZ Company produced an annualized
return of 9.06%.
Often, it is necessary to adjust the return for taxes which makes a difference to the total returns. Let us take a
simple example to illustrate these point.

                                                    Portfolio Information

                    Beginning value                                                                   ` 1,00,000

                    Cash flows

                    Dividends received                     `7,500

                    Capital appreciation                   `12,500

                    Ending value                                                                      `1,20,000

                Total Return                                 [(1,20,000/1,00,000)]-1 = 20%

Suppose the investor has a tax rate of 30%. The Rs.7,500 in dividends yields only Rs.5,250 after taxes (Rs.7500
*.70), and the capital gains is only Rs.8,750 after taxes (Rs.12,500*.70). So, after-tax return equals
[(1,00,000+5,250+ 8,750)/1,00,000]-1= 14%
High nominal returns may also reflect high inflation rate. Suppose that during the performance measurement
period a 10 percent return was required just to maintain purchasing power. After-tax real return equals
[(1,00,000+5,250+ 8,750)/1,00,000(1.10)]-1= 3.6364%


764
Security Analysis                                                                                      LESSON 18

So, the rate of return to this portfolio is either 20% or 14% or 3.6364%. for a tax exempt investor the 20% return
is appropriate. For a taxable investor, the return is only 14%. Inflation affects both equally.
Example 2: Three years ago, Fred invested $10,000 in the shares of ABC Corp. Each year, the company
distributed dividends to its shareholders. Each year, Fred received $100 in dividends. Note that since Fred
received $100 in dividends each year, his total income is $300. Today, Fred sold his shares for $12,000, and he
wants to determine the HPR of his investment.
Solution: Using the HPR formula, we can find the following:

                                                    $300 + $12000 - $ 10000
                Holding Period Return (HPR) =                                          = 0.23 or 23%
                                                              $10000
Example 3: What is the HPR for an , who bought a stock a year ago at $50 and received $5 in dividends over
the year, if the stock is now trading at $60?
Solution:

                                                             5 + (60 – 50)
                               Holding Period Return =                         = 30%
                                                                   50
Example 4: Which investment performed better: Mutual Fund X, which was held for three years and appreciated
from $100 to $150, providing $5 in distributions, or Mutual Fund B, which went from $200 to $320 and generated
$10 in distributions over four years?
Solution:

                                                         5 + (150 – 100)
                                 HPR for Fund X =                            = 55%
                                                              100

                                                     10 + (320 – 200)
                                 HPR for Fund Y =                            = 65%
                                                             200
Note: Fund B had the higher HPR, but it was held for four years, as opposed to the three years for which Fund X
was held. Since the time periods are different, this requires annualized HPR to be calculated, as shown below.
Calculation of Annualized HPR
Annualized HPR for Fund X:
= (0.55 + 1)1/3 – 1 = 15.73%
Annualized HRP for Fund Y:
= (0.65 + 1)1/4 – 1 = 13.34%
Thus, despite having the lower HPR, Fund X was the superior investment.

 APPROACHES TO VALUATION OF SECURITY
Security analysis begins with assessing the intrinsic value of security. There are three main schools of thought on
the matter of security price evaluation. Advocates of different schools can be classified as (1) Fundamentalists;
(2) Technicians; and (3) efficient market advocates. Let us compare these different perspectives in summary form
before describing them in detail.
(1) The Fundamental Approach: The Fundamental approach suggests that every stock has an intrinsic value.
Estimate of intrinsic worth of a stock is made by considering the earnings potential of firm which depends

                                                                                                               765
EP-CA&FM                                                                                                 Security Analysis

upon investment environment and factors relating to specific industry, competitiveness, quality of management,
operational efficiency, profitability, capital structure and dividend policy. The earning potential is converted into
the present value of the future stream of income from that stock discounted at an appropriate risk related rate
of interest. Security analysis is done to compare the current market value of particular security with the intrinsic
or theoretical value. Decisions about buying and selling an individual security depends upon the comparison.
If the intrinsic value is more than the market value, the fundamentalists recommend buying of the security and
vice versa.
(2) Technical Approach: The technical analyst endeavours to predict future price levels of stocks by examining
one or many series of past data from the market itself. The basic assumption of this approach is that history
tends to repeat itself and the price of a stock depends on supply and demand in the market place and has little
relationship with its intrinsic value. All financial data and market information of a given security is reflected in
the market price of a security. Therefore, an attempt is made through charts to identify price movement patterns
which predict future movement of the security. The main tools used by technical analysis are: (1) The Dow Jones
theory which asserts that stock prices demonstrate a pattern over four to five years and these patterns are
mirrored by indices of stock prices. The theory employs two Dow Jones averages – the industrial average and
the transportation average. If industrial average is rising, then transport average should also rise. Simultaneous
price movement is the main prediction which may show bullish as well as bearish results. Chart Patterns are
used along with Dow Jones Theory to predict the market movements.
(3) Efficient Capital Market Theory : The theory is popularly known as “Efficient Capital Market Hypothesis:
(ECMH). The advocates of this theory contend that securities markets are perfect, or at least not too imperfect.
The theory states that it is impossible to beat the market because stock market efficiency causes existing share
prices to always incorporate and reflect all relevant information. It is based on the assumption that in efficient
capital markets prices of traded securities always fully reflect all publicly available information concerning
those securities. Market efficiency was development in 1970 by the economist Eugene Fama, whose theory of
efficient market hypothesis stated that it is not possible for an investor to outperform the market because all
available information built in to all stock prices. For market efficiency, there are three essential conditions; (i) all
available information is cost free to all market participants; (ii) no transaction costs; and (iii) all investors similarly
view the implications of available information on current prices and distribution of future prices of each security.
It has been empirically proved that stock prices behave randomly under the above conditions. These conditions
have been rendered unrealistic in the light of the actual experience because there is not only transaction cost
involved but traders have their own information base. Moreover, information is not costless and all investors do
not take similar data and interpretation with them.
Efficient Market Hypothesis has put to challenge by the fundamental and technical analysts to the extent that
random walk model is valid description of reality and the work of chartists is of no real significance in stock price
analysis. In practice, it has been observed that markets are not fully efficient in the semi-strong or strong sense.
Inefficiencies and imperfections of certain kinds have been observed in the studies conducted so far to test the
efficiency of the market. Thus, the scope of earning higher returns exists by using original, unconventional and
innovative techniques of analysis. Also, the availability of inside information and its rational interpretation can
lead to strategies for deriving superior returns.
In short, if these theories are taken in their strongest forms, fundamentalists say that a security is worth the
present value (discounted) of a stream of future income to be received from the security; technicians assert that
the price trend data should be studied regardless of the underlying data; efficient market theorists contend that
a share of stock is generally worth whatever it is selling for.
There are four confusing terms which are appearing at this juncture-face value, book value; market value and
intrinsic value. Let us first clarify all them.

Security Analysis                                                                                         LESSON 18

Face value of the security is the denominating value. It is also called the nominal value. When we say that
authorized share capital of a company is ` 200 lac divided into 20 lac shares of ` 10 each, we mean that the
face value or the nominal value of the share is ` 10/- each.
The book value may be much more than the face value. Let us assume that the shares of ` 10/- each are issued
at ` 30/- each. The issuer is charging a premium of ` 20/- for the intrinsic value equalization. The issuer normally
charges premium for the following attributes:
       –   Long years of establishment and profitable track record.
       –   Leadership position in the market.
       –   Potential for continued growth in the future.
       –   Existence of free reserves with the issuer which makes the book value higher than the face value.

 Case Study
Let us clarify the concept of book value a little further. Assuming that a company has been incorporated with
an authorized capital of 2 crore shares of ` 10/- each and the company operates profitably for three years, the
broad financial position of the company shall be as under:
                                                                                                            (` In lacs)

Book value of the share of the company became less than face value at the end of the first year due to the loss
incurred by it. The book value was equal to the face value at the end of the second year due to recoupment
of the loss. At the end of the third year the book value become ` 14/- due to building up of reserves. If, after the
end of the third year the issuer wishes to come up with an offering of additional shares, the offer price will not
be less than ` 14.
In actual market conditions does the book value track the market value? We may observe the trend of few

We note that the market value is not equal to the book value for shares of any of the leading companies of the
country. In fact, there is wide divergence between these two. The divergence is mostly on the upper side except
in some cases. We can conclude, therefore, that book value is not a perfect indicator of the intrinsic value of a
security. At best it can be an indicator of the floor value or base value below which the market value in normal
circumstances should not slide. Book value is a historic indicator. It depicts what the company has earned and
saved in the past. It does not reflect the future earning potential of the company.

Security Analysis                                                                                         LESSON 18

Having considered that the book value is not an appropriate measure for ascertaining the real or intrinsic
value of a security, let us take up a more rigourous process of evaluating securities called fundamental
analysis.

 FUNDAMENTAL APPROACH TO VALUATION
The investor seeks to arrive at the real value or the intrinsic value of a security through the process of security
analysis. This value is arrived at by using a number of tools of financial analysis and it approximates the level
at which the demand and supply of stock of the security would be in equilibrium leading to stability of prices.
Price of the security below and above this level would tend to be unstable.

Money has a “time value.” the powerful tools of compounding and discounting can help us build a theoretical
framework of valuation of bonds and stocks. Bond values are reasonably easy to determine. As long as a
bond is not expected to go into default, the value of the bond is made up of present values of annual interest
payments plus the principal amount to be recovered at maturity or sooner. Valuation of equity is different
because earnings and dividend streams are uncertain as to timing of receipt and the amount of dividend.
The value of an equity stock at any moment in time can be thought of as the discounted value of a series of
uncertain future dividends that may grow or decline at varying rates over time.

It is easiest to start with equity valuation where the expected holding period is one year. The benefit any
investor receives from holding an equity stock consists of dividends plus any change in price during the holding
period. Suppose we buy one share of SBI at the beginning of the year for Rs. 500. We hold the stock for one
year. Rs.20 in dividends is collected at year-end, and the share is sold for Rs.530. the rate of return achieved is
the composite of dividend yield and change in price (capital gains yield). Thus, we get

Dividend yield = D/P= 20/500 = .04 Capital gains yield = 530-500/500= .06

The total rate of return achieved is .04+.06=.10 or 10 percent. How might we express this same notion in terms
of present values? Thus:

                                                      D1            P1
                                            P0 =              +
                                                      (1+r)        (1+r)

where:

D1 = dividend to be received at the end of year 1
r = investor’s required rate of return or discount rate P1 = selling price at the end of year 1

P0 = selling price today

Therefore,

                                                      ` 20          530
                                            500 =             +
                                                      (1+r)         (1+r)
Will r = .10 balance the equation? At a required rate of return of 10 percent, the dividend is worth `18.18 (`20*.909)
and selling price has a present value of ` 481.8182 (`530 *.909) (see present value table). The combined present
value is ` 500.

Should a rate of return of 15 percent have been required, the purchase price would have been too high at

` 500. (the dividend of `20 and selling price of `530 remains constant). To achieve a 15% return, the value of the
stock at the beginning of the year would have had to be


                                                                                                                 769
EP-CA&FM                                                                                                 Security Analysis

P0 = (`20/1.15) + (`530/1.15)
= `17.39 + 460.87
= ` 478.26
An alternative approach would be to ask the question: at what price must we be able to sell the stock at the end
of one year (if purchase price is ` 500 and the dividend is ` 20) in order to attain a rate of return of 15 percent?
` 500 = (`20/1.15) + (P1/1.15)
` 500 = `17.39 + .87 P1
` 554.72 = P1 (selling price)
Now let us look at a multiple year holding period. In most cases dividends will grow from year to year. We can
similarly add the present value of all dividends to be received over the holding period and the present value of
the selling price of the stock to the end of the holding period to arrive at the present value of the stock.
To simplify, let us assume that dividends will grow at the constant rate into the indefinite future. Under this
assumption the value of a share is

                                 D(1+g)              D (1+g)2                D(1+g)3          +D(1+g)n
                          P0 =                +                     +                     +
                                  (1+r)1              (1+r)2                  (1+r)3           (1+r)n
where n approaches infinity, this equation reduces simply to

                                                                  D1
                                                          P0 =
                                                                  r -g
This model states that the price of a share should be equal to next year’s expected dividend divided by
the difference between the appropriate discount rate for the share and its expected long term growth rate.
Alternatively, this model can be stated in terms of the rate of return on an equity share as
r = (D1/P0) + g
Illustration: An investor is holding 1000 shares of Right Choice Ltd. The current rate of dividend paid by the
company is ` 5/- per share. The long term growth rate is expected to be 10% and the expected rate of return is
19.62%. We need to find out the current market price of the share:

The real value or intrinsic value is valid for a given set of conditions. These conditionalities include the national
and international economic situation, industry specific and company specific circumstances. The first three
conditionalities are viewed from a macro perspective in order to even out the effect of minor happenings. The
last conditionality is observed at the micro level because at this level, even relatively smaller happenings can
disturb the demand supply equilibrium.

 ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO VALUATION

 1. Random walk theory
In the Fundamental Analysis, factors such as economic influences, industry factors and particular company
information are considered to form a judgment on share value. On the other hand, price and volume information
is analyzed in Technical Analysis to predict the future course of share values. There is another approach which
negates both Fundamental and Technical analysis. This approach has been based upon the research aimed at
testing whether successive price changes are independent in different forms of market efficiency.
According to the theory, share prices will rise and fall on the whims and fancies of manipulative individuals.
As such, the movement in share values is absolutely random and there is no need to study the trends and
movements prior to making investment decisions. No sure prediction can be made for further movement or trend
of share prices based on the given prices as at a particular moment. The Random Walk Theory is inconsistent
with technical analysis. Whereas, it states that successive price changes are independent, the technicians claim
that they are dependent. But believing in random walk does not mean that one should not believe in analyzing
stocks. The random walk hypothesis is entirely consistent with an upward and downward movement in price, as
the hypothesis supports fundamental analysis and certainly does not attack it.
One of the advantages of this theory is that one is not bothered about good or bad judgement as shares are
picked up without preference or evaluation. It is easier for believers in this theory to invest with confidence. The
second advantage is that there is no risk of being ill informed while making a choice as no information is sought
or concealed.
Random walk theory implies that short term price changes i.e day to day or week to week changes are random
but it does not say anything about trends in the long run or how price levels are determined.

 2. Efficient – Market Theory
Efficient Market Hypothesis accords supremacy to market forces. A market is treated as efficient when all
known information is immediately discounted by all investors and reflected in share prices. In such a situation,
the only price changes that occur are those resulting from new information. Since new information is generated
on a random basis, the subsequent price changes also happen on a random basis. Major requirements for an
efficient securities market are:
    –    Prices must be efficient so that new inventions and better products will cause a firms’ securities prices
         to rise and motivate investors to buy the stocks.
    –    Information must be discussed freely and quickly across the nations so that all investors can react to
         the new information.
    –    Transaction costs such as brokerage on sale and purchase of securities are ignored.
    –    Taxes are assumed to have no noticeable effect on investment policy.
    –    Every investor has similar access to investible funds at the same terms and conditions.
    –    Investors are rational and make investments in the securities providing maximum yield.
Research studies devoted to test the random walk theory on Efficient Capital Market Hypothesis (ECMH) are
put into three categories i.e.
   (a)   the strong form,
   (b)   the semi-strong form, and



                                                                                                                771

   (c)   the weak form theory.




  (a)    The Strong Form of Efficiency: This test is concerned with whether two sets of individuals – one having
         inside information about the company and the other uninformed could generate random effect in price
         movement. The strong form holds that the prices reflect all information that is known. It contemplates
         that even the corporate officials cannot benefit from the inside information of the company. The market
         is not only efficient but also perfect. The findings are that very few and negligible people are in such
         a privileged position to have inside information and may make above-average gains but they do not
         affect the normal functioning of the market.
  (b)    Semi-strong form of Efficiency: This hypothesis holds that security prices adjust rapidly to all publicly
         available information such as functional statements and reports and investment advisory reports,
         etc. All publicly available information, whether good or bad is fully reflected in security prices. The
         buyers and sellers will raise the price as soon as a favourable price of information is made available
         to the public; opposite will happen in case of unfavourable piece of information. The reaction is almost
         instantaneous, thus, printing to the greater efficiency of securities market.
   (c)   The Weak Form theory: This theory is an extension of the random walk theory. According to it, the
         current stock values fully reflect all the historical information. If this form is assumed to be correct, then
         both Fundamental and Technical Analysis lose their relevance. Study of the historical sequence of
         prices, can neither assist the investment analysts or investors to abnormally enhance their investment
         return nor improve their ability to select stocks. It means that knowledge of past patterns of stock prices
         does not aid investors to make a better choice. The theory states that stock prices exhibit a random
         behaviour.
In this way, if the markets are truly efficient, then the fundamentalist would be successful only when (1) he has
inside information, or (2) he has superior ability to analyse publicly available information and gain insight into

the future of the company. The empirical evidence of the random walk hypothesis rests primarily on statistical
tests, such as runs test, correlation analysis and filter test. The results have been almost unanimously in support
of the random walk hypothesis, the weak form of efficient market hypothesis.

 3. Capital Asset Pricing Mode (CAPM)
CAPM explains the relationship between the Expected Return, Non-Diversifiable Risk (Systematic Risk) and
the valuation of securities. Under CAPM price of a security is calculated with the help of expected return from
security.
Formula for Computing Expected Return: E(RP) = Rf +(Rm –Rf {ß} Where E(RP) = Expected Return on Portfolio
RF = Risk Free Rate of Interest/ Return ß = Portfolio Beta
RM = Expected Return on Market Portfolio
Example 1: Using the following information calculate expected return:
Current yield on a U.S. 10-year treasury is 2.5%
The average excess historical annual return for U.S. stocks is 7.5%
The beta of the stock is 1.25
Solution: Expected return = Risk Free Rate + [Beta x Market Return Premium]
Expected return = 2.5% + [1.25 x 7.5%]
Expected return = 11.9%
Example 2: Winner Corporation stock will pay a dividend of $1.32 next year. Its current price is $24.625 per
share. The beta for the stock is 1.35 and the expected return on the market is 13.5%. If the riskless rate is 8.2%,
what is the expected growth rate of Winner Corporation?
Solution: Using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM),
E(Ri) = r + i [E(Rm) − r]
We first find the expected rate of return as:
E(Ri) = 0.082 + 1.35 [0.135 − 0.082] = 0.15355 = R
The expected rate of return E(Ri), for a security is also its required rate of return R by the investors. Using the
growth model for a stock

                                                             D1
                                                     P0 =
                                                            R–g
we get, R − g = D1/P0, or g = R − D1/P0,
which gives g = 0.15355 − 1.32/24.625 = 0.1.
Thus the growth rate is 10%
Example 3: Peak Services Ltd. common stock has a = 1.15 and it expects to pay a dividend of $1.00 after one
year. Its expected dividend growth rate is 6%. The riskless rate is currently 12%, and the expected return on the
market is 18%. What should be a fair price of this stock?
Solution: E(Ri) = r + i [E(Rm) − r]
we get E(Ri) = 0.12 + 1.15 [0.18 − 0.12] = 0.189

                                                                                                               773
EP-CA&FM                                                                                           Security Analysis

Thus, the expected return on the stock is 0.189, and the expected growth rate is 0.06.

                   1
 P0                          = $7.75
            0.189 – 0.06
Example 4: Wonderful Oil stock currently sells at $120 a share. The stockholders expect to get a dividend of $6
next year, and they expect that the dividend will grow at the rate of 5% per annum. The expected return on the
market is 12% and the riskless rate is 6%. Wonderful Oil announced that it has won the multimillion dollar navy
contract, and in response to the news, the stock jumped to $125 a share. Find the beta of the stock before and
after the announcement.
Solution: Using Gordon’s growth model, P0 = D1 / R − g , we get R = D1/P0 + g, which is also the expected return
on the stock, E(R). But by CAPM,
E(Ri) = r + i [E(Rm) − r]
we get

                                                          E(Ri) – r
                                                  β=
                                                         E(Rm) – r

                                                             D1 / P0 + g –r
                                             Thus, β =
                                                              E(Rm) – r

                                                             D1 / P0 + g –r
                                                              E(Rm) – r

                                          6 /120 + 0.05 – 0.06
                                  β=                                   = 0.667, before.
                                               0.12 – 0.06

                                            6/125 +0.05 – 0.06
                               And β =                                  = 0.633, after.
                                                0.12 – 0.06

      l Investment may be defined as a conscious act on the part of a person that involves deployment of
         money in securities issued by firms with a view to obtain a target rate of return over a specified period
         of time.
      l Investment is conscious act of deployment of money in securities issued by firms. Speculation also
         involves deployment of funds but is not backed by a conscious analysis of pros and cons.
      l Investment is the employment of funds on assets with the aim of earning income or capital appreciation.

      l Speculation also involves deployment of funds but it is not backed by a conscious analysis of pros and

   l Risk in security analysis is generally associated with the possibility that the realized returns will be less
       than the returns that were expected.
   l Risk can be classified under two main groups, viz., systematic risk and unsystematic risk.

   l Return is the primary motivating force that drives investment. It represents the reward for undertaking
       investment.
   l The main objective of security analysis is to appraise are intrinsic value of security.

   l The Fundamental approach suggests that every stock has an intrinsic value which should be equal
       to the present value of the future stream of income from that stock discounted at an appropriate risk
       related rate of interest.
   l Technical approach suggests that the price of a stock depends on supply and demand in the market
       place and has little relationship with its intrinsic value.
   l Efficient Capital Market Hypothesis (ECMH) is based on the assumption that in efficient capital markets
       prices of traded securities always fully reflect all publicly available information concerning those
       securities.
   l Performance of a company is intimately related to the overall economic environment of the country
       because demand for products and services of the company would under normal circumstances be
       directly related to growth of the country’s economy.
   l Industry level analysis focuses on a particular industry rather than on the broader economy.

   l Dow Jones theory shows that share prices demonstrate a pattern over four to five years and these
       patterns can be divided into primary, secondary and minor trends.
   l Charts and Indicators are two major tools of Technical Analysis.



                                                     GLOSSARY

 Security Analysis : Security analysis refers to the method of analyzing the value of securities like shares and
 other instruments to assess the total value of business which will be useful for investors to make decisions.
 There are three methods to analyze the value of securities – fundamental, technical, and quantitative
 analysis.
 Quantitative Analysis: Quantitative analysis refers to the analysis of securities using quantitative data.
 Portfolio Theory : Portfolio theory was proposed by Harry M. Markowitz of University of Chicago. According
 to Markowitz’s portfolio theory, portfolio managers should carefully select and combine financial products
 on behalf of their clients for guaranteed maximum returns with minimum risks.
 Alpha : The amount of return expected from an investment from its inherent value.
 Annualized : A procedure where figures covering a period of less than one year are extended to cover a
 12-month period.
 Annualized rate of return : The average annual return over a period of years, taking into account the effect
 of compounding. Annualized rate of return also can be called compound growth rate.
 Appreciation : The increase in value of a financial asset.
 Asset allocation : The process of dividing investments among cash, income and growth buckets to optimize
 the balance between risk and reward based on investment needs.

                                                                                                               775
EP-CA&FM                                                                                            Security Analysis


 Asset class : Securities with similar features. The most common asset classes are stocks, bonds and cash
 equivalents.
 Average maturity : For a bond fund, the average of the stated maturity dates of the debt securities in the
 portfolio. Also called average weighted maturity. In general, the longer the average maturity, the greater the
 fund’s sensitivity to interest-rate changes, which means greater price fluctuation. A shorter average maturity
 usually means a less sensitive - and consequently, less volatile - portfolio.
 Bear market : A bear market is a prolonged period of falling stock prices, usually marked by a decline of
 20% or more. A market in which prices decline sharply against a background of widespread pessimism,
 growing unemployment or business recession. The opposite of a bull market.
 Benchmark : A standard, usually an unmanaged index, used for comparative purposes in assessing
 performance of a portfolio or mutual fund.
 Beta : A measurement of volatility where 1 is neutral; above 1 is more volatile; and less than 1 is less volatile.
 Blue chip : A high-quality, relatively low-risk investment; the term usually refers to stocks of large, well-
 established companies that have performed well over a long period. The term Blue Chip is borrowed from
 poker, where the blue chips are the most valuable.
 Capitalization : The market value of a company, calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding
 by the price per share.
 Cash equivalent : A short-term money-market instrument, such as a Treasury bill or repurchase agreement,
 of such high liquidity and safety that it is easily converted into cash.
 Equity fund : A mutual fund/collective fund in which the money is invested primarily in common and/or
 preferred stock. Stock funds may vary, depending on the fund’s investment objective.
 Expense ratio : The ratio between a mutual fund’s operating expenses for the year and the average value
 of its net assets.
 Green bonds : A type of fixed-income instrument that is specifically earmarked to raise money for climate
 and environmental friendly projects.
 Green Bond Principles : Voluntary process guidelines that recommend transparency and disclosure and
 promote integrity in the development of the Green Bond market by clarifying the approach for issuance of
 a Green Bond.
 Growth stock : Typically a well-known, successful company that is experiencing rapid growth in earnings
 and revenue, and usually pays little or no dividend.
 Impact investing : A sustainable investment style that seeks to generate measurable positive social or
 environmental impact alongside financial return. Investment themes include activities such as affordable
 housing, education and healthcare.
 Investment stewardship : Engaging with companies and voting proxies to ensure our clients’ interests are
 represented and protected and the company is focused on responsible allocation of capital and long-term
 value creation.
 Horizontal Analysis : Horizontal analysis is used in financial statement analysis to compare historical data,
 such as ratios, or line items, over a number of accounting periods. Horizontal analysis can either use absolute
 comparisons or percentage comparisons, where the numbers in each succeeding period are expressed as
 a percentage of the amount in the baseline year, with the baseline amount being listed as 100%. This is also
 known as base-year analysis.

 Vertical Analysis : Vertical analysis is a method of analyzing financial statements that list each line item as
 a percentage of a base figure within the statement. The first line of the statement always shows the base
 figure at 100%, with each following line item representing a percentage of the whole. For example, each line
 of an income statement represents a percentage of gross sales, while each line of a cash flow statement
 represents each cash inflow or outflow as a percentage of total cash flows.

 INTRODUCTION
One of the three strategic dimensions to achieve competitive advantage in industry, together with product
differentiation and focus or niche, according to Michael E. Porter’s theory of generic competitive strategies,
is “Cost Leadership.” Cost leadership refers to delivering services or producing items at the lowest possible
cost while retaining quality for more competitive pricing. It is crucial for an entity to fit into one of the three
competitive strategy dimensions in a business environment where every entity strives to obtain the top
position not only in domestic but also in the global competitive market. If an organisation has a strong Cost
and Management Accounting system in place, it can attain cost leadership, another topic related to Cost and
Management Accounting. This chapter will cover a variety of cost accounting topics as well as how they are
used in manufacturing and service environments.

 AN OVERVIEW OF COSTING
Any system for allocating expenses to a business component is known as costing. Costing is frequently used
to create costs for customers, distribution channels, personnel, geographical regions, goods, product lines,
processes, subsidiaries, and whole businesses. Planning and managing a company’s operating expenses is the
process of costing. In order to budget, anticipate, and monitor costs more accurately, it also involves gathering,
evaluating, and reporting cost information. Cost is the price paid, which is typically calculated based on the
resources given up to accomplish a specific goal. It is a price paid in exchange for certain commodities or
services. Not all costs are expenses. While some expenditures are expenses, others are assets. Costs have
expired (been used up).
ICWAI, India defines cost as “measurement in monetary terms, of the amount of resources used for the
purpose of production of goods or rendering services”
Cost refers to the amount of payment made to acquire any goods and services. In a simpler way, the concept
of cost is a financial valuation of resources, materials, risks, time and utilities consumed to purchase goods
and services. From an economist’s point of view, the cost of manufacturing any goods and services is often
said to be the concept of opportunity cost.
The concepts, practices, procedures, and processes used in a firm to plan and regulate how its resources
are used are included in the definition of cost accounting. The application of costing and cost accounting
principles, methodologies, and techniques to the science, art, and practise of cost control and the determination
of profitability is how CIMA (London) defines it. It also comprises the dissemination of data obtained from it for
managerial decision-making.
Cost accounting is therefore the science, the art, and the practise of a cost accountant. It is a science in that
it is a body of methodical knowledge that a cost accountant must possess in order to carry out his tasks and
responsibilities in a professional manner. It is an art since it calls for a cost accountant’s expertise and talent to
apply cost accounting principles to a variety of managerial issues, such as price fixing, cost control, etc.

 Nature and Scope of Costing
Costing is the process of determining costs, according to the C.I.M.A., London. It discusses methods and
procedures for estimating costs as well as the guiding concepts and regulations governing how much goods
and services should cost. Cost accounting is a technique for cost accounting. Analyzing the costs related to a
good or activity is only one aspect of cost accounting. It considers a number of factors, such as different cost
structures, possible business opportunities, budget planning, profitability analysis, and more. In this context,
“scope” refers to the area of activity. Calculating the cost of a specific good or activity is referred to as cost
accounting. Both internal and external reports reporting can benefit from the data it gives. Cost information is
presented in detail in internal reporting:

 NATURE OF COSTING
1. Cost Accounting is a Branch of Knowledge-Though cost accounting is considered as a branch of financial
accounting, it is one of the important branches of knowledge. It is an organized body of knowledge consisting
of its own principles, concepts and conventions. These principles and rules vary from industry to industry.
2. Cost Accounting is a Science- Cost accounting is considered as a science because it is a body of systematic
knowledge relating to not only cost accounting but relating to a wide variety of subjects such as law, office
practice and procedure, data processing, production and material control, etc. It is necessary for a cost
accountant to have intimate knowledge of all these field of study in order to carry on day-to-day activities. But
it is to be admitted that it is not a perfect science as in the case of natural science.
3. Cost Accounting is an Art. Cost accounting is an art in that it calls on the ability and expertise of a cost
accountant to apply the concepts, procedures, and methods of cost accountancy to specific management
issues. These issues include determining cost control, determining profitability, and other issues.
4. Cost accounting is a profession. In recent years, cost accounting has emerged as one of the crucial and most
difficult occupations. These two facts make this opinion clear. First, the establishment of numerous professional
organisations, including the National Association of Accountants (NAA), the Institute of Cost and Management
Accountants in the United Kingdom, the Institute of Cost and Works Accounts in India, and similar organizations
in developed and developing nations, has increased public awareness of the costing profession. Second, many
students have enrolled in these institutions in order to gain expensive degrees and membership necessary for
supporting themselves.
  (a)   Costing methodology and process: Costing methodology consists of two separate processes.
          (i) Cost collection and classification based on numerous factors.
         (ii)   Apportionment and allocation of costs that cannot be directly attributed to production. Costing as
                a process is concerned with the regular determination of cost using the official approach.

                                                                                                              781
EP-CA&FM                                                                     Operational Approach to Financial Decision

   (b)      Cost estimation is done in three parts.
      (i)   Expenditure analysis and data collecting,
   (ii)     Production measurement at various stages
   (iii)    Compensating for production costs to accomplish the initial step. Different systems, including Historical,
            Estimated, and Standard Cost, have been created in costing. Costing has created a variety of techniques
            for achieving the second phase, including work costing, contract costing, single or output costing, etc.
            for completing the final phase, finally. Important methods have been established in costing, including
            absorption costing, marginal costing, and standard costing.

 Objectives of Costing

Facts are collected into statistics.

1. Ascertainment of Cost
The first and most significant goal of costing is cost determination. In order to ensure that all costs are included
in the price of the products, techniques, and costing process employed, it is important to ascertain the cost of
each product, process, or operation.
It is beneficial to do preliminary research and implement a system for recording costs in order to determine
the cost of management with the assistance of the costing department. Materials, labour, and other expenses
are maintained in a correct and thorough manner (referred to as covered heads).As a result, the management
gathers cost information on a regular basis, which is then used to establish the selling price. Therefore, the
costs and sales are equal. This matching procedure assists in determining and raising the product’s profitability.
Importantly, costing gives managers a way to determine costs as well as a foundation for determining the
profitability of any services or products being provided.

2. Cost Control
Cost estimation alone is insufficient. Naturally, it is insufficient because the cost dictates the selling price, which
in turn decides the profitability. As a result, “the lower the cost, the larger to profit” is the standard that everyone
tries to adhere to. It’s crucial to keep costs under control in order to bring about this norm’s fundamental goal
of lower prices for goods and services. A comparison is conducted after budgets have been created, standards
have been established, and actual have been determined. Corrective action is conducted if any discrepancy
between the actual, the budget, and the standards is found. As a result, managers can increase their income or
lower the selling price while also helping to control costs. As a result, the customer can gain from higher quality,
which can increase consumer loyalty to the brand and business.

3. Guidelines for Management
The devoted servant of managers in a company is costing. In all practical respects, it supports managerial
decision-making. Managers can work toward efficiency for the entire organisation with the use of cost data that
comes from costing. Cost information offers organisational recommendations for different managerial choices.
For instance, the utilisation of cost data might direct the launch of a new product line, reveal areas of untapped
capacity, or draw attention to growth prospects.

 Types of Costing
Cost can be defined as the amount (measured in terms of money) paid for goods and services received (or to be
received).Accountants and managers use many different concepts of cost, each usually for a different purpose.

It is the classification of cost that indicates to managers how the term is being used and whether they can do
anything about the cost or not.
Important types of costs are explained below
Costs are broadly classified into four types: fixed cost, variable cost, direct cost, and indirect cost.
Variable Cost: A variable cost changes in direct proportion to a change in the level of activity.
Fixed Cost: These costs do not change in total as activity changes.
Direct Cost: A direct cost is a cost that can be traced to specific segments of operations.
Indirect Cost: An indirect cost is a cost that cannot be identified with specific segments of operations. Common
costs are shared by multiple segments.
Relevant Costs : All those costs which influence a choice of alternatives in a particular situation (decision to be
taken) and are also affected by that decision are said to be relevant costs of that decision
Irrelevant Costs : All those costs which remain the same and are not affected by the decision whatever
alternative is chosen are said to be irrelevant costs for that decision
Sunk Costs: Sunk costs are the historical costs that arise due to decisions made in the past and cannot be
changed by any decision made in future. Example: investments in Plant & Machinery is a prime example of sunk
cost; in decisions relating to replacement of old machine, the written down value of old machine adjusted for its
recoverable value is a sunk cost as it has been incurred in past and cannot be changed by future decision. Since
sunk costs cannot be altered in future, they are always irrelevant costs in future decision making.
Shut down Costs: These are the unavoidable fixed costs which continue to be incurred even when a plant is
temporarily shut down. Example: rent, insurance and depreciation of building, salaries of permanent staff etc.
Managers must take into account shutdown costs while considering shutdown or continue decisions.
Imputed/Hypothetical/Notional Costs: These are the costs for which neither any transaction has taken place
nor any cash outlay is there but it represents a sacrifice or resource use capable of being measured in monetary
terms. Example: a producer is doing production in his own premises for which no rent is paid but which has
a market value of Rs. 15,000 per month, he can record Rs. 15,000 per month as notional factory rent while
determining the cost of production of output.
Out of Pocket Cost / Explicit Costs: These are those costs that require cash outlay due to a particular managerial
decision. It represents both present and future outflow of cash due to a decision.

 Advantages of Costing
Costing gives useful cost information. As a result, it is crucial in managerial decision-making. A sound costing
system is also important in order to provide high-quality services. The costing department has a significant
impact on the benefits managers gain from costing, notably in the following dimensions:
    1.   Measurement and Improvement of Efficiency: The chief advantage to be gained is that Cost Accounting
         will enable a concern to, first of all, measure its efficiency and then to maintain and improve it. This
         is done by suitable comparisons and analysis of the differences that may be observed. Example- if
         materials spent upon a pair of shoes in 2001 comes to Rs. 100 and for a similar pair of shoe the amount
         is Rs. 120 in 2002. It is an indication of decline in efficiency. Of course, the increase may only be due to
         increase in price of materials; it may also be due to greater wastage in use of materials or inefficiency
         at the time of buying so that unnecessary high prices were paid.
   2.    Profitable and Unprofitable Activities: It will throw light upon those activities which bring profits and
         those activities which result in losses. This will be done only if the cost of each product or each job is
         ascertained and compared with the price obtained.

                                                                                                                783
EP-CA&FM                                                                     Operational Approach to Financial Decision

   3.      Fixation of Prices: In many cases a firm is able to fix a price for its products on the basis of the cost of
           production. In such a case, price cannot be properly fixed if no proper figures of cost are available. In
           case of big contracts, no quotation can be made unless the cost of completing that contract can be
           ascertained. If prices are fixed without costing information, it is possible that the price quoted may either
           be too high, in which case orders cannot be obtained, or it may be too low, in which case an order will
           result in a loss. It is a mistake on the part of any management to believe that mere increase in sales
           volume will result in profits; increased sales at prices lower than the cost may well lead the concern to
           the bankrupt court. Only Cost Accounting will reveal what price will be profitable.
  4.       Guide in Reducing Prices: In certain periods it becomes necessary to reduce the price even below the
           total cost. This will be so when there is a depression or slump. Costs, properly ascertained, will guide
           management in this direction.
  5.       Information for Proper Planning: For a proper system of Costing, it is necessary to have detailed
           information about the facilities available about machine and labour capacity. This helps in proper
           planning of work so that no section is overworked and no section remains idle.
  6.       Control over Materials etc. : Information about availability of stocks of various materials and stores
           must be constantly available if there is a good system of Cost Accounting. This helps in two ways.
           Firstly, production can be planned according to the availability of materials and fresh stocks can be
           arranged in time when old stocks are exhausted. Secondly, loss due to carelessness or pilferage or any
           other mischief will be known and, therefore, put down.
      7.   Decision Regarding Machine vs. Labour : Some of the important questions before management can be
           solved only with the help of information about costs. For example, if there is the problem of replacement
           of labour by machinery, Cost Accounting will at least guide management in finding out what the cost of
           production will be if either machinery or labour is used.
  8.       Expansion in Production: Sometimes it is necessary to decide whether production of one product or
           the other is to be increased. This problem can also be solved only if proper information about costs is
           available.
   9.      Reasons for Losses Detected: Exact causes of existence of profits or losses will be revealed by a
           system of Cost Accounting. For example, a concern may suffer not because the cost of production is
           high or prices are low but because the output is much below the capacity of the concern. It is only Cost
           Accounting which will reveal this reason for loss. It also helps in distinguishing between expenditure and
           loss which is necessary and that which is unnecessary, that is to say, between normal and abnormal
           losses.
  10.      Helps in Taking Decisions: Cost Accounting inculcates the habit of making calculations with pencil and
           paper before taking a decision. It will certainly check recklessness. Also some of the silly mistakes that
           sometimes occur can be avoided if there is a good Cost Accounting system. To give an instance, a well-
           known firm once quoted for supply of mosquito nets to the Government at a very low price. It was only
           after the order was obtained that the firm found that, by mistake, the price of materials was not included
           in the quotation.
  11.      Check on Accuracy of Financial Accounts: A good system of Cost Accounting affords an independent
           and most reliable check on the accuracy of financial accounts. This check operates through reconciliation
           of profits shown by Cost Accounts and by Financial Accounts. On the basis of various advantages of
           Cost Accounting, it can be easily said that ‘a good system of costing serves as a means of control over
           expenditure and helps to secure economy in manufacture’.

 Limitation of Costing
    1.    Expensive : The organization of the costing system and highly compensated cost accountants require
         further spending before installing it, though, care must be taken to make sure that the savings outweigh
         the cost of the accounting system.
   2.     More Difficult : The cost accounting system includes a lot of processes in determining cost, such as
         gathering and classifying expenses, allocating and apportioning expenses, etc. These procedures are
         regarded as difficult and demand a number of forms and paperwork to prepare the reports. Accounts
         will take longer to prepare as a result of this.
   3.    Limited Applicability : It is impossible for all business companies to employ the same costing methods
         and techniques. Everything relies on the type of business it is and the products it produces. The results
         of the business are misled if the incorrect technique and procedure are employed.
   4.    Inappropriate: Cost accounting systems are only appropriate for large-scale businesses; they are not
         ideal for small-scale businesses because they are more expensive.
   5.    Lack of Uniformity: The biggest drawback of the cost accounting method is its lack of uniformity. It does
         not adhere to any standard process. It is feasible for two cost accountants of comparable competence
         to get different conclusions using the same data. As a result, it is said that all outcomes from cost
         accounting are only approximations.
   6.    Lack of Accuracy - Cost Accounting accuracy varies. When estimating costs for a certain circumstance,
         some assumptions are always made.

 BASIC PRINCIPLES OF COSTING
    1.   Cause-and-effect relationships:
		 For each expense component, a cause-and-effect link needs to be defined. Each cost should be
   as closely tied to its root cause as feasible, and its impact on the various departments should be
   determined. Only units that travel through the departments at which a cost has been incurred should
   share that cost.
   2.    Previous Costs That Could Not Be Collected in the Past Should Not Be Included in Future Costs:
		 Recovering past costs that could not be recovered in the past should not be done since it will not only
   skew the results of the future period’s actual operations but also other statements.
   3.    Charge of Cost Only Upon Incurrence:
		 Only costs that have been legitimately incurred should be included in unit costs. For instance, unit costs
   shouldn’t be included in selling costs while an item is still being produced.
   4.    Abnormal Costs Are Excluded from Cost Accounts:
		 When calculating the unit cost, all expenses incurred for unusual causes (such as theft or negligence)
   shouldn’t be taken into account. If done thus, it will skew expense estimates and mislead management,
   leading to poor choices.
   5.    Double Entry Principles Preferably Should Be Obeyed:
		 Cost ledgers and cost control accounts should, to the greatest extent possible, be maintained using
   double entry methods to reduce the likelihood of any error or mistake. By doing this, the accuracy
   of cost sheets and cost statements that are created for cost estimation and cost control would be
   guaranteed.

                                                                                                              785

 Relationship of Cost Accounting, Management Accounting, Financial Accounting and Financial
 Management
Different fields including Cost Accounting, Management Accounting, Financial Accounting, and Financial
Management are closely related to one another.
These fields can occasionally interact and depend on one another.




 CLASSIFICATION OF COSTS
It refers to the categorization of expenses based on their shared traits. The following categories are crucial for
classifying costs: I By Nature or Element; (ii) By Functions; and (iii) By Variability or Behaviour (iv) By Capability
(v) By Regularity (vi) By Costs for Managerial Decision Making.




Material cost: The price of the materials needed to produce a good or render a service is referred to as the
material cost. All indirect materials required in the production process, such as cleaning supplies, are not
included in the material cost.
Employee (Labour) Cost :The cost of labor is the sum of all wages paid to employees, as well as the cost of
employee benefits and payroll taxes paid by an employer. The cost of labor is broken into direct and indirect
(overhead) costs.
Other Expenses :Expenditure other than material and labour is the third element of cost.
It is defined by I.C.M.A. as- “The cost of service provided to an undertaking and the notional cost of the use of
owned assets”.

 Marginal Costing
The price to manufacture a second unit of output is known as the marginal cost. Since marginal cost aids in
determining the level of production that is the most effective for a manufacturing process, it is a crucial topic in
cost accounting. It is estimated by estimating the costs incurred even if just one more unit is produced.
For Example:
Variable cost per unit                                           = Rs 25
Fixed cost                                                       = Rs 1,00,000
Cost of 10,000 units                                             = 25 × 10,000 = Rs 2,50,000
Total Cost of 10,000 units = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost
                                                                 = 1,00,000 + 2,50,000
                                                                 = Rs 3,50,000
Total cost of 10,001 units                                       = 1,00,000 + 2,50,025
                                                                 = Rs 3,50,025
Marginal Cost                                                    = 3,50,025 – 3,50,000
                                                                 = Rs 25
 Illustration 1: From the following particulars calculate:
   a.    P/V Ratio b. Fixed Cost
   b.    I year sales Rs. 1, 95,000 profit Rs. 9,000
    c.   II Year sales Rs. 2, 25,000 profit Rs. 15,000
 Solution:
 P/V Ratio = Change in Profit / Change in Sales
 = 15,000 - 9,000 / 2,25,000 1,95,000 = 6,000 /30,000 × 100
 P/V Ratio = 20%
 Variable Cost= Sales (1- P/V Ratio)
                = Rs. 2,25,000 (1- 0.20)
                = Rs. 2,25,000 × 0.80 = Rs. 1,80,000
 Fixed Cost     = Sales – Variable Cost – Profit
                = Rs. 2,25,000 – Rs. 1,80,000 – 15,000 = Rs. 30,000
 Illustration 2: A cost sheet shows the following situations prevailing in Star Ltd., which is facing depression: Direct
 Materials -- Rs. 50,000 Direct Wages -- Rs. 20,000 Overheads: Variable -- Rs. 10,000 Fixed -- Rs. 20,000 -- Rs.
 30,000 Total Cost -- Rs.1,00,000 Sales 4,000 units @ Rs. 23 per unit -- Rs. 92,000 Loss: -- Rs. 8,000 There is no
 sign of improvement in the situation. Therefore, the management wants to know whether it is desirable to stop the
 production. What should be the minimum price at which company should shut down its production?
 Solution:
 Even if there is a loss of Rs. 8,000, it is not desirable to stop the production. Because, fixed costs will be incurred


                                                                                                                     787

 even if production is stopped and loss would be equal to fixed cost of Rs. 20,000. The RCUB, B.Com – 6th Semester
 Elements of Costing – II Page | 10 present loss is less because selling price is more than marginal cost and the
 same contributes towards recovery of fixed costs. Therefore, so long as there is contribution, it is not advisable to
 stop the production. The following statement gives the clear idea of the situation.

                                   Marginal Cost                        Per Unit           Total (Rs.)

                 Less: Fixed Cost                                           5.00              20,000

                 Loss                                                       2.00                8,000

 The price per unit of Rs. 23 is more than marginal cost of Rs. 20. Therefore, the production should be continued.
 The minimum price at which production should be discontinued should be equal to marginal cost. In this case
 marginal cost is Rs. 20, so minimum price should be Rs. 20. It is better to stop the production if selling price
 falls below the marginal cost of Rs. 20 to avoid the loss more than fixed cost of Rs. 20,000.

 Illustration 3:
 The National Company has just been formed. They have a patented process that will make them the sole
 suppliers of Product A.
 During the first year, the capacity of their plant will be 9,000 units, and this is the amount they will be able
 to sell. Their costs are:
      l   Direct labor = $15 per unit
      l   Raw materials = $5 per unit
      l   Other variable costs = $10 per unit
      l   Fixed costs = $240,000
 There are two parts to this question:
  (a)     If the company aims to make a profit of $210,000 for the first year, what should the selling price be?

 Solution
  (a)      Calculation of selling price
		 Direct labor (9,000 x 15) = $135,000
		 Raw materials (9,000 x 5) = $45,000
		 Other variable costs (9,000 x 10) = $90,000
		 Total variable costs (PU 30) = 270,000
		Add: Fixed Cost = 240,000
		 Profit = 210,000
		 Total sales value of 9,000 units @ $80 per unit = 720,000
  (b)      Sales in units
		 (Fixed expenses + Desired profit) / (Sales – Variable cost)
		Thus,
		 Fixed Expenses = 2,40,000 (given) + 1,00,000 (extra) + 50,000 (advertisement cost)
		 = 840,000 + Desired Profit (760,000) = $1,600,000
		 = 1,600,000 / (70 – 30) = 40,000 units

 Thus the technique of marginal costing assumes that the difference between the aggregate value of sales
 and the aggregate value of variable costs or marginal costs, provides a fund (called contribution) to meet
 the fixed costs and balance is the profit. The concept of contribution is a very useful tool to management in
 managerial decisions making.

  P/V Ratio (Contribution ÷ Sales)                                     0.60                                0.50

 In case of A Ltd., every sale of Rs. 100 gives a contribution of Rs. 60 whereas in case of B Ltd. every sale of
 Rs. 100 provides a contribution of Rs. 50. In case of heavy demand, profit of A Ltd. will rise much faster in
 comparison to B Ltd. During poor demand or decline in sales of Rs. 100 will lead to decline in contribution in
 A Ltd. and B Ltd. by Rs. 60 and Rs. 50 respectively.
 Mathematically,
 Sales = Variable cost + Fixed cost ± Profit.
 Sales – Variable cost = Fixed Cost ± Profit
 Sales – Variable cost = Contribution
 Contribution –Fixed cost = ± Profit
 To make profit, contribution should be greater than fixed cost. Further, to maximize profit, contribution should
 be maximized. When contribution is equal to fixed cost, then a firm is at ‘no profit no loss point’ called break-
 even point.
 Formulae of Marginal Costing: The difference between the change in costs and the change in quantity is
 used to compute marginal cost. Assume, for instance, that a factory wants to boost its output to 10,000 units
 from its present 5,000 units. The marginal cost of production is equal to the difference between the factory’s
 present cost of production ($100,000) and the cost of production ($150,000) when production is increased
 (10,000 - 5,000).

 Need for Marginal Costing
Marginal Costing is clearly the core aspect of traditional management accounting. Some of the classical
applications of management accounting, however, have begun to lose their significance. The question thus
arises: What is the current role of Marginal Costing in modern management accounting?
Marginal cost means the cost of the marginal or last unit produced. It is also defined as the cost of one more
or one less unit produced besides existing level of production. In this connection, a unit may mean a single
commodity, a dozen, and a gross or any other measure of goods. Example, if a manufacturing firm produces
X unit at a cost of Rs.300 and X+1 unit at a cost of Rs.320, the cost of an additional unit will be Rs.20 which is
marginal cost. Similarly if the production of X-1 units comes down to Rs.280, the cost of marginal unit will be
Rs.20 (300– 280). The marginal cost varies directly with the volume of production and marginal cost per unit
remains the same. It consists of prime cost, i.e. cost of direct materials, direct labor and all variable overheads.
It does not contain any element of fixed cost which is kept separate under marginal cost technique.Therefore,
the need for Marginal Costing is as follows:
    1.   Cost-volume-profit relationship data wanted for profit planning purposes is readily obtained from the
         regular accounting statements. Hence management does not have to work with two separate sets of
         data to relate one to the other.
   2.    The profit for a period is not affected by changes in absorption of fixed expenses resulting from building
         or reducing inventory. Other things remaining equal (e.g. selling prices, costs, sales mix), profits move
         in the same direction as sales when direct costing is in use.
   3.     Manufacturing cost and income statements in the direct cost form follow management’s thinking more
         closely than does the absorption cost form for these statements. For this reason, management finds it
         easier to understand and use direct cost reports.
   4.    The impact of fixed costs on profits is emphasised because the total amount of such cost for the period
         appears in the income statement.
   5.    Marginal income figures facilitate relative appraisal of products, territories, classes of customers, and
         other segments of the business without having the results obscured by allocation of joint fixed costs.
   6.    Marginal costing lies in with such effective plans for cost control as standard costs and flexible budgets.
    7.   Marginal costing furnishes a better and more logical basis for the fixation of sales prices as well as
         tendering for contracts when business is at low ebb.
   8.    Break-even point can be determined only on the basis of marginal costing.

 Features of Marginal Costing
The following are characteristics of marginal costing:
    1.   Appropriate and accurate division of total cost into fixed and variable by picking out variable portion of
         semi variable costs also.
   2.    Marginal costing avoids, the difficulties of having to explain the purpose and basis of overhead
         absorption to management that accompany absorption costing. Fluctuations in profit are easier to
         explain because they result from cost volume interactions and not from changes in inventory valuation.
   3.    It is easier to make decisions on the basis of marginal cost presentations, e.g., marginal costing shows
         which products are making a contribution and which are failing to cover their avoidable (i.e., variable)
         costs. Under absorption costing the relevant information is difficult to gather, and there is the added
         danger that management may be misled by reliance on unit costs that contain an element of fixed cost.

                                                                                                                791
EP-CA&FM                                                                  Operational Approach to Financial Decision

   4.      Marginal costing is essentially useful to management as a technique in cost analysis and cost
           presentation. It enables the presentation of data in a manner useful to different levels of management
           for the purpose of controlling costs. Therefore, it is an important technique in cost control.
   5.      Future profit planning of the business enterprises can well be carried out by marginal costing. The
           contribution ratio and marginal cost ratios are very useful to ascertain the changes in selling price,
           variable cost etc. Thus, marginal costing is greatly helpful in profit planning.
   6.      When a business concern consists of several units and produces several products and evaluation of
           performance of such components can well be made with the help of marginal costing.
      7.   It is helpful in forecasting.
   8.      When there are different products, the determination of number of units of each product, called Optimum
           Product Mix, is made with the help of marginal costing.
   9.      Similarly, optimum sales mix i.e., sales of each and every product to get maximum profit can also be
           determined with the help of marginal costing.
  10.      Valuation of stocks such as finished goods, work-in-progress is valued at variable cost only.
   11.     The fixed costs are written off soon after they are incurred and do not find place in product cost or
           inventories.
  12.      Prices are based on Marginal Cost and Marginal Contribution.
  13.      It combines the techniques of cost recording and cost reporting.

 Ascertainment of Profit under Marginal Cost
The term “contribution” refers to a sum of money equal to the selling price of a good less the marginal cost. One
way to characterize contribution is as follows:
Contribution = Selling Price – Marginal Cost
Contribution = Fixed Expenses + Profit
Contribution – Fixed Expenses = Profit

 a profit of Rs. 15,000 (iii) A net profit of Rs. 150,000 from sales. (iv) Point sales that break even.
 Solution:
    (i)   P/V Ratio = {(F+P) / S} x 100 Here, F = Rs. 15,000, P = Rs. 10,000 and S = Rs. 1,00,000. P/V Ratio = [(15,000
          + 10,000) / 1,00,000] x 100 P/V Ratio = 25%.
   (ii)   P/V Ratio = {(F+P) / S} x 100 Here 25 = {(15,000+15,000) /S}x100 [ Given Profit = Rs. 15,000] Or, S =
          (30,000/25) x 100 Sales = 1,20,000 Sales required to earn a profit of Rs. 15,000 = Rs.1,20,000.
  (iii)   When Sales =Rs.1,50,000, Then Profit = ? P/V Ratio ={(F+P) / S} x 100 Here, 25 = [(15,000+P)1,50,000]
          x 100 [Given Sales= Rs.1,50,000] Or, 15,000 + P = 1,50,000 x 25 / 100 Or, 15,000 + P = 37,500 Profit =
          37,500 – 15,000 = Rs.22,500 Net Profit from sales of Rs.1,50,000 = Rs. 22,500.
  (iv)    We know, at BEP – P/V Ratio = F+ BEP Sales x 100 Or, 25 = (15,000 / BEP Sales) x 100 Or, BEP Sales =
          (15,000 / 25) x 100 = 60,000 ÷ Break – even Point Sales = Rs. 60,000.

 Advantages of Marginal Costing
The following are some benefits of marginal costing:
    1.   Effective cost control – It divides cost into fixed and variable. Fixed cost is excluded from product. As
         such, management can control marginal cost effectively.
   2.    Treatment of overheads simplified – It reduces the degree of over or under-recovery of overheads due
         to the separation of fixed overheads from production cost.
   3.    Uniform and realistic valuation – As the fixed overhead costs are excluded from product cost, the
         valuation of work-in-progress and finished goods become more realistic.
   4.    Helpful to management – It enables the management to start a new line of produc­tion which is
         advantageous. It is helpful in determining which is profitable whether to buy or manufacture a product.
         The management can take decision regarding pricing and tendering.
   5.    Helps in production planning – It shows the amount of profit at every level of output with the help of
         cost volume profit relationship. Here the break-even chart is made use of.
   6.    Better results – When used with standard costing, it gives better results.
    7.   Fixation of selling price – The differentiation between fixed costs and variable costs is very helpful in
         determining the selling price of the products or services. Sometimes, different prices are charged for the
         same article in different markets to meet varying degrees of competition.
   8.    Helpful in budgetary control – The classification of expenses is very helpful in budgeting and flexible
         budget for various levels of activities.
   9.    Preparing tenders – Many business enterprises have to compete in the market in quoting the lowest
         price. Total variable cost, when separately calculated, becomes the ‘floor price’. Any price above this
         floor price may be quoted to increase the total contribution.
  10.    “Make or Buy” decision – Sometimes a decision has to be made whether to man­ufacture a component
         or a product or to buy it ready-made from the market. The decision to purchase it would be taken if the
         price paid recovers some of the fixed expenses.
   11.   Better presentation – The statements and graphs prepared under marginal costing are better
         understood by management executives. The break-even analysis presents the behaviour of cost, sales,
         contribution etc. in terms of charts and graphs. And, thus the results can easily be grasped.

 Breakeven Point
The break-even point (break-even price) for a trade or investment is determined by comparing the market price
of an asset to the original cost; the break even point is reached when the two prices are equal.
The break-even point is the point at which total cost and total revenue are equal, meaning there is no loss
or gain for your small business. In other words, you’ve reached the level of production at which the costs of
production equals the revenues for a product.
A company’s breakeven point is the point at which its sales exactly cover its expenses. Fixed Costs ÷ (Price -
Variable Costs) = Breakeven Point in Units. Pricing a product, the costs incurred in a business, and sales volume
are interrelated
The phrase “ascertainment of level of operations when total revenue equals entire costs” is used to describe
break-even analysis. At any stage of operations, it is an analysis performed to determine the likely profit or loss.
Break-even analysis is a technique for analysing how sales revenue, variable expenses, and fixed costs relate
to one other in order to identify the operating level at which all costs are equal to sales revenue and there is
no profit or loss.
This is a crucial strategy used in managerial decision-making and profit planning. Graphical charts are used to
do break-even analysis. A break-even chart shows an approximation of profit or loss at various sales volume
levels within a specific range. The break-even charts display sales income, fixed costs, and variable costs.
The objectives of break even analysis are given below:
   (1)    In order to forecast profit accurately, it is essential to know the relationship between profits and costs
          on the one hand and volume on the other.
   (2)    It is useful in setting up flexible budgets which indicate costs at various levels of activity.
   (3)    It is of assistance in performance evaluation for the purposes of control. For reviewing profits achieved
          and cost incurred the effects on costs of changes in volume are required to be evaluated.
   (4)    Pricing plays an important part in stabilizing and fixing up volume. Analysis of break even relationship
          may assist in formulating price policies to suit particular circumstances by projecting the effect which
          different price structures have on costs and profits.
   (5)    As predetermined overhead rates are related to a selected volume of production, study of break even
          relationship is necessary in order to know the amount of overhead costs which could be charged to
          product costs at various level of operation.

 Steps in Construction of Break-even Chart
Building a break-even chart involves the following steps:
Step 1:
Choose a scale for the horizontal axis’ sales (units).
Step 2:
Choose a scale for the vertical axis of costs and revenues.
Step 3:
Create a fixed cost line that is perpendicular to the horizontal axis.
Step 4:
Beginning at the fixed cost point on the vertical axis, draw the total cost line.

Operational Approach to Financial Decision                                                               LESSON 19

Step 5:
Draw a sales line that extends from the origin (zero) to the point of greatest sales.
Step 6:
When total costs equal total revenues, the sales line will cross the total cost line.
Step 7:
The “break-even point,” or the location where there is neither a profit nor a loss, is the intersection of two lines.
Step 8:
The sales value and quantity produced at break-even point are given by the lines drawn from junction to the
horizontal axis and vertical axis.
Step 9:
If the production falls below the break-even threshold, a loss is displayed, and if it exceeds the break-even
point, a profit is displayed.
Step 10:
The margin of safety is equal to the total sales minus break-even sales.
Step 11:
The angle of incidence is the angle that the sales line creates with the total cost line when it intersects that line
at the break-even point.




In order to evaluate an organization’s viability and make judgments about profit planning and expense control,
break-even point analysis is useful. The break-even point, or point at which there is no net profitability, occurs
when sales are just equal to costs. Costs are made up of both fixed and variable expenses.
It is a helpful instrument in financial planning that is used to recover expenditures and increase revenues.
The break-even point will change as operating conditions, such as selling price, variable cost, and fixed cost,
change. Costs must be divided into fixed and variable costs for the purpose of calculating the break-even point.

                                                                                                                 797

When calculating the break-even point, the fundamental premise is that the selling price per unit, variable cost
per unit, and fixed cost per unit remain constant.
The fundamental premise in calculating break-even point is that selling price per unit, variable cost per unit,
and total fixed expenses are constant. The operational and sales capacity needed to cover all costs is known
as the break-even point. Beyond the point of break-even, any more activity or sales will result in a profit for the
company.

 Illustration 2: A company manufactures a products, currently providing 80% capacity with a turnover of `8,
 00,000 at ` 25 per unit. The cost data are as under: Material cost `7.50 per unit, Labour cost `6.25 per unit.
 Semi-variable cost (including variable cost of `3.75 per unit) `1, 80, 000,Fixed cost `90,000 up to 80% level
 of output, beyond this an additional `20,000 will be incurred.
 Calculate: 1. Activity level at breakeven point
 Solution:
 1. Number of units sold = Sales ÷ Selling price p.u. = `8,00,000 ÷ 25 per unit = 32,000 units
 Fixed cost included in the semi-variable cost = Total semi variable cost – variable element
 = `1,80,000 – (`3.75 p.u. x 32,000 units) = `60,000
 Variable cost p.u. = `7.50 + 6.25 + 3.75 =`17.50
 Contribution p.u, = Selling price – variable cost = `(25 – 17.50) = `7.50
 Breakeven Point = Fixed Cost/Contribution per unit = 90000+60000/7.50 = 20,000 units
 `Activity level at BEP = 80% / 32000 units * 20,000 units = 50.00%
 Illustration 3: MNP Ltd sold 2, 75,000 units of its product at `37.50 per unit. Variable costs are ` 17.50 per unit
 (manufacturing costs of ` 14 and selling cost ` 3.50 per unit). Fixed costs are incurred uniformly throughout
 the year and amounting to ` 35, 00,000 (including depreciation of ` 15, 00,000). There is no beginning or
 ending inventories. Required: COMPUTE breakeven sales level quantity and cash breakeven sales level
 quantity.
 Solution:
 Break even Sales Quantity = Fixed cost/ Contribution margin per unit = 35, 00,000 / 20 ` = 1, 75,000 units
 Cash Break-even Sales Quantity = Cash Fixed Cost/ Contribution margin per unit
 = 20, 00,000/ 20 ` =1, 00,000 units.
 Illustration 4: Mahindra Ltd. sells two products, J and K. The sales mix is 4 units of J and 3 units of K. The

 Sales mix (in quantity) is 4 units of Product- J and 3 units of Product- K i.e. Sales ratio is 4: 3
 Composite contribution per unit by taking weights for the product sales quantity
  =Product J- 40* 4/ 7 + Product K- 20*3/ 7 = `22.86 + `8.57 = Rs 31.43
 Composite Break-even point = Common Fixed Cost/ Composite Contribution per unit
 = 6,16,000 / 31.43 = 19,600 units
 Break-even units of Product-J = 19,600*4/ 7 = 11,200 units

 Assumption and Limitation of Breakeven Analysis
In doing a break-even analysis, the following presumptions and restrictions should be taken into account:
   (a)   To do a break-even analysis, all expenditures must be divided into fixed and variable components.
         Accurately separating semi-variable costs into their variable and fixed components is challenging.
   (b)   All fixed costs are expected to remain constant throughout all levels of activity. However, in actuality, it
         could not be permanently fixed.
   (c)   Another presumption is that variable costs actually fluctuate and are directly related to production
         volume. It indicates that the variable cost per unit of the product stays the same. In actuality, output and
         variable costs are not always strictly correlated.
   (d)   In a break-even analysis, it is assumed that production and sales units are equal, and that there is
         no inventory at the start or end of the period under consideration. In reality, inventory will always be
         present.
   (e)   Assuming that the sales mix does not change and that the selling price stays the same at all output
         levels, there will be no change in the selling price. In the actual world, it can be necessary to frequently
         alter the selling pricing and product mix in order to boost sales.
   (f)   It is assumed that there won’t be any changes to productivity, operational effectiveness, product
         requirements, or methods of production and distribution. It is impracticable to assume that these factors
         remain constant because, in reality, operating efficiency and productivity depend on the availability of
         labour.
   (g)   A break-even chart can only show the position of one product; it is necessary to create separate charts
         for each product. It also fails to show the numerous items that make up the sales mix.
   (h)   The capital used in the business, which is one of the key factors in determining the profitability of the
         company and its goods, is ignored by break-even analysis.
   (I)   The break-even charts presumptively depict total cost and total revenue as straight lines. Costs and
         revenue have a curvilinear function in real life.

 Profit Volume Ratio
Profit-Volume Ratio (P/V) measures the percentage of turnover that each product contributes to. It shows how
the contribution to sales is related. Knowing the business’s profitability is helpful.
This ratio is calculated as:
P/V Ratio = Contribution/Sales x 100
One can increase contribution by doing any of the following:
   (a)   A rise in the asking price
   (b)   Lower marginal costs through effective use of labour, resources, and machinery.
   (c)   Emphasize the selling of goods having a comparatively higher PV ratio.

 Limitation
When utilising PV ratios in break-even analysis, the following restrictions should be kept in mind:
   (a)   A P.V. ratio that strongly relies on revenue surpluses over variable costs


800
Operational Approach to Financial Decision                                                              LESSON 19

   (b)   The PV ratio does not account for the capital expenditures required by the increased productive
         capacity as well as the increased fixed costs.
   (c)   It simply provides a general sense of the relative profitability of the various products and product lines.
         Making a final choice will not be of any assistance.
   (d)   The accurate division of costs into fixed and variable costs is a necessary condition for comparing
         profitability using the PV ratio. Oversimplifying anything can result in a wrong conclusion.
   (e)   The most profitable item will only be shown by a higher P.V. ratio per unit of sales or output when other
         conditions are constant.
 Illustration 1: The profit volume ratio of X Ltd. is 50% and the margin of safety is 40%. You are required to
 calculate the net profit if the sales volume is `1,00,000
 Margin safety Ratio = Margin Safety/Actual Sales *100
 40 = Marginal Safety/100,000*100
 Margin of Safety = Rs 40,000
 Marginal safety = Profit /PV ratio
 Rs 40,000= Profit/50%
 Profit = 40000*50%
 = Rs 20,000

 Working notes:
  (a)   Contribution p.u. = Selling price p.u. - Variable cost p.u.
		 = 20 minus 4 equals 16
		 16 rupees worth of contribution
  (b)   The PV ratio is calculated as follows: Contribution p.u./Selling price p.u. x 100 = Rs.16/Rs.20 x 100 =
        80% or 0.80
 Break-even sales result in neither a profit nor a loss.
 Verification
 Break-even sales = Fixed cost - Variable cost = 0.
 5,000 units times 20 rupees, 5,000 units times 4, and 80,000 rupees equal zero.
 1,00,000 minus 20,000 minus 80,000 = 0.
 For example : DB Ltd furnished the following information

 You are required to compute:
  (a)   P/V Ratio.
  (b)   Break-even point.
  (c)   Total variable cost for 2005-2006 & 2006-2007.
  (d)   Sales required to earn a profit of Rs. 60,000.
  (e)   Profit/Loss when sales are Rs. 1,00,000
 Solution:
  (a)   P/V Ratio = Change in Profit Change in Sales x 100 Here, P/V Ratio = [(50,000–30,000) / (2,50,000–
        2,00,000)] x100 = 40%
  (b)   P/V Ratio = {(F+P) / S} x 100 In the year 2006-2007 – P/V Ratio = [(F + 50,000) / 2,50,000] x 100 Or, 40
        = (F + 50,000) 2,500 Or, F + 50,000 = 1,00,000 Fixed Cost = Rs. 50,000 Now, BEP Sales = Fixed Cost /
        P/V Ratio x 100 ∴ BEP Sales = (50,000 /4) x 100 = Rs. 1,25,000.
  (c)   P/V Ratio = {(S – V ) / S} x 100 In the year 2005-2006 – 40 = {(2,00,000 – V) / 2,00,000} x 100 Or,
        80,000 = 2,00,000 – V Or, V = 2,00,000 – 80,000 Total Variable Cost for 2005-06 = Rs. 1,20,000. In
        the year 2006-07 – 40 = {(2,50,000 – V) / 2,50,000} x 100 Or, 1,00,000 = 2,50,000 – V Or, V = 2,50,000
        – 1,00,000 Total Variable Cost for 2005-06 = Rs. 1,50,000.

  (d)   P/V Ratio = {(F + P) / S} x 100 Here, 40 = {(50,000 + 60,000) / S} x 100 Or, S = (1,10,000 / 40) x 100 ∴
        Required Sales = Rs. 2,75,000.
  (e)   P/V Ratio = {(F + P) / S} x 100 Here, 40 = {(50,000 + P) / 1,00,000} x 100 Or, 40,000 = 50,000 + P P =
        (10,000) ∴ Loss = Rs. 10,000

 Margin of Safety
Sales above the volume necessary to break even are referred to as the margin of safety. It stands for the
discrepancy between sales at a particular activity level and sales at break-even. In order to keep the business’
operations viable, there needs to be a suitable margin of safety.
A low margin of safety typically denotes large fixed expenses, meaning earnings won’t be realised until there
is a significant amount of activity to cover the fixed expenses. A margin of safety gives a concern strength and
stability.
The margin of safety is an essential metric, particularly in periods of declining sales, to understand the true
position to run profitably and to take action to raise the margin of safety.
The difference between actual sales and the break-even point is the margin of safety. The business is in a
stronger financial position when there is a larger margin of safety. This implies that a higher profit margin and
vice versa correspond to a higher margin of safety.
Margin of Safety is calculated by using the following formulae:
Margin of Safety = Actual Sales – Break- Even Sales
Or = Proft/ PV ratio
Or = Profit * Selling price p.u / Selling Price per unit – Variable cost per unit
Margin of Safety as % of Total Sales
= Margin of Safety / Total Sales *100
 Illustration 1: From the following information of Akansha Co. Ltd. Calculate P/V Ratio and Margin of Safety.
    i.    Sales -- Rs. 10, 00,000
    ii.   Variable Cost -- Rs. 4, 00,000
   iii.   Profit -- Rs. 3, 00,000
 Solution: Contribution = Sales – Variable Cost
                           = Rs. 10,00,000 – Rs. 4,00,000
                           = Rs. 6,00,000
 Fixed Cost = Sales – Variable Cost – Profit or Contribution - Profit
              = Rs. 10,00,000 – Rs. 4,00,000 – Rs. 3,00,000
              = Rs. 10,00,000 – Rs. 7,00,000
              = Rs. 3,00,000
 P/V Ratio = 6,00,000/ 10,00,000*100
             = 60%
 BEP (Value) = Fixed Cost / P V Ratio
               = 3, 00,000 / 0.6 = Rs. 5, 00,000
 Margin of Safety = Sales – BEP
                     = Rs. 10, 00,000 – Rs. 5, 00,000
                     = Rs. 5, 00,000

                                                                                                             803

 Illustration 2: Surya Ltd has a total turnover of Rs. 10 lakhs. It is enjoying 30% margin of safety. Its total
 variable cost is 60% of sales. Determine Fixed Cost and BEP in Sales.
 Solution: Variable Cost = 60% of Sales
                           = 0.60 × Rs. 10, 00,000 = Rs. 6,00,000
 Contribution = Sales – Variable Cost
               = Rs. 10,00,000 – Rs. 6,00,000
               = Rs. 4,00,000
 P/V Ratio = Contribution/ Sales
            = 4,00,000/10,00,000*100 = 40%
 Margin of Safety = 30% of Rs. 10,00,000
                    = Rs. 3,00,000
 Margin of Safety = Profit/ P V Ratio :
                    Profit = Margin of Safety × P/V Ratio
                    = Rs. 3, 00,000 × 0.40
                    Profit = Rs. 1, 20,000
 Fixed Cost = Contribution – Profit
             = Rs. 4, 00,000 – Rs. 1, 20,000
             = Rs. 2,80,000
 BEP (Value) = Actual Sales – Margin of Safety
               = Rs. 10,00,000 – 3,00,000
              = Rs. 7,00,000

 How to improve margin of Safety
The product or product line will be more profitable the bigger the margin of safety.
Any of the following measures can increase the margin of safety:
   (a)   Trying to maintain the maximum level of actual sales while keeping the break-even point at the lowest
         possible level.
   (b)   Increased in sales volume
   (c)   A rise in the asking price.
   (d)   Increasing contribution due to a change in product mix.
   (e)   Reducing in fixed costs
   (f)   Reducing in variable costs.
   (g)   Eliminating unprofitable products from the sales mix.
 Illustration 3: You have access to XYZ Ltd.’s data for the fiscal year that concluded on March 31, 2009,sales
 of 100,000 units at Rs. 10 p.u. for variable costs: Rs. 6. 3,00,000 rupees per year in fixed costs. Determine the
 safety margin.

 Solution:
 Break-even Sales = Fixed cost/Contribution p.u. = Rs. 3,00,000/Rs. 4 = 75,000 units
 Margin of Safety = Actual sales – Break-even sales
                   = 1,00,000 units – 75,000 units = 25,000 units
                   = 25,000 units x Rs. 10 = Rs. 2,50,000.


 Angle of Incidence
The “angle of incidence” is the angle that the sales line creates with the total cost line. Higher profit margins
are predicted by larger incidence angles, and vice versa. It serves as a gauge of profitability over the point of
break-even.
If the management is given important information about its profitability by taking into consideration and studying
both the margin of safety and the angle of incidence. The most profitable posture for the business concern will
be one with a large margin of safety and a wider angle of incidence, and vice versa.
Relationship of BEP, Margin of Safety and Angle of Incidence:
The relationship among Break-even point, Margin of safety and Angle of incidence is summarized as follows:
Break-Even Level: This is the production or sales level at which there is neither a profit nor a loss. As a result,
there is neither a profit nor a loss at this point in the sales process. Only when actual sales exceed break-even
sales does the company begin to make a profit. Better than a corporation with a higher break-even point is one
with a lower break-even point.
Angle of Incidence: In a break-even chart, this angle is created by the intersection of the total cost line and
the total income line. Higher profitability is indicated by a larger angle of incidence, and lesser profitability is
indicated by a smaller angle.



                                              LESSON ROUND-UP

   l Costing is fundamentally a method by which we allocate costs to various company components. It is a
       method of calculating costs.
   l In order to support strategic planning and increase cost effectiveness, cost accounting is a system for
       tracking and analysing the price of goods and services.
   l It’s crucial for management, staff, and customers, among other stakeholders in a business. Despite
       their interdependence, cost accounting and financial accounting have different outcomes.
   l Financial accounting shows you the profit and loss for the entire organisation, whereas cost accounting
       informs you of the costs associated with producing specific things. While there are benefits to having a
       specialised cost accounting system, a business that is capable of managing all of its costs can handle
       all
   l Marginal costing: The extra expense incurred in producing an extra unit of output is referred to as a
       marginal cost. A different name for this approach is the cost-profit-volume analysis. The relationship
       between production volume, selling price, costs, expenses, and profits is examined via marginal cost
       analysis. It is determined by dividing by revenue after deducting variable costs.



                                                                                                                805

                                            What is Marginal Costing?




  l Managers can use it to manage budgets and profitability, control manufacturing costs, optimise
      production, streamline operations, and much more.
  l Marginal costs are typically influenced by variable expenses. However, in situations where output is
      increased, it can take fixed expenses into account. When a business sets the selling price for a good or
      service, it optimises profits when its marginal cost and marginal income are equal.
  l A break-even point is used in multiple areas of business and finance. In accounting terms, it refers to
      the production level at which total production revenue equals total production costs. In investing, the
      break-even point is the point at which the original cost equals the market price
  l Generally, to calculate the break-even point in business, fixed costs are divided by the gross profit
      margin. This produces a dollar figure that a company needs to break even.
  l Margin of safety is an investing principle that involves only procuring a security when its market price
      is substantially less than its intrinsic value.
  l The angle that a line (such as a ray of light) falling on a surface or interface makes with the normal
      drawn at the point of incidence.
  l P/V ratio = Contribution/ Sales. It is used to measure the profitability of the company. Contribution is the
      excess of sales over variable cost. So basically P/V ratio is used to measure the level of contribution
      made at different volumes of sales.


                                                    GLOSSARY

 Costing: Costing is any system for assigning costs to an element of a business.

 allocations, and posted cost entries in cost journals.
 Cost behavior: Cost behavior classifies costs according to their behavior in relation to changes in key
 business activities
 Level: Level is used to define allocation order
