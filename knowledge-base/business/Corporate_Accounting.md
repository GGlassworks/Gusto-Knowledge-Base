INTRODUCTION:

      The objectivd of company account is to know methods of preparing the books of accounts
of the corporate houses to determine the net income and financial position of the orglanieztlton

Definition of GomPanY -
      Section 3(1 Xi) of the companies Act 1 956 defines a company as "company formed and
r€gistered under this Act or an existing compant''. An existing company.means a company
formed and registered under any of the former companies Acts'

Meaning of a companY -

      A company is an association of persons with capital contributed by them to carry out a
common purpoJe i.e., to earn profit out of it. The capital of a company is divided into numerous
transferable shares. lt enjoys perpetual succession, a common seal and Iegal entity different
from its members.

CHARACTERISTICS OF A COMPANY :

       To have a ilear idea regarding status ofa company let us discuss the characteristics of
a company as follows.

1   ,2 The basic characteristics of a company are as follows   :


.      separate Legal Entity : A company enjoys a separate legal entity distinct from its
       members. lt is treated as a separate legal person having duties and rights distinct from
       those of its members. The scope of its activities and the working of the compahy is
       r6gulated by ils Memorandum of Association, Articles of Assoiiation, provisions of the
       Companies Act and SEBI guidelines.'lt can own properties, enter:inio contracts,'eic. in
       his own name. lt is held responsible for the actS of the company'
.       Common - seal : A company, being an artificial legal person, acts through riatural
        persoris. These natural persons act on behalfofthe company and sign on behalf of the
        company under the common-seal of the company.
.       Limited Llability : Liability of the members is limited to the contribution promised by
        them. In a company limited by shares, members (also called sharqhotders) are liable to
        contribute the value of shares held by them. ln case a company is limited by guarantee,
        members are liable to contribute the guaranteed amount only. For academic purposes,
        a company can have members with unlimited liability. These conipanies are -called
        unlimited comoanies.



                                                  z
.       Separation of Ownership and Management : As the number of shareholders is very
        large. management is entrusted to a select few. They elect their representatives in
        shareh,clders meeting to direct the affairs of the company. Elected representatives are
        calleC Direclors and the group of directors is termed as 'Board of Directors', Board of
        Directors manage the affairs of the company and for certain crucial decisions they
        again corne to the bddy of shareholders. In shareholders meeting, decisions are taken
        by passi,rg a resolution. Resolution passed with simple majority is called Ordirrary
        Resolution'and if it is to be passed with three-fourth majority, ii is referred to as 'Special
        Elesolution'.
.       Perpetual Succession : Company being an artificial legal person, is not affected by
        the death, insolvency, lunacy, etc. of its members. lt is created by law and comes to end
        only by the process of law.
.       Transferability of Shares : Member ota company can transferhis interest or share in
        the company without the concurrence of other membe.rs. lt provides liquidity of
        investment. Facility of transfer of shares, alongwith limited liability has made company
        form of organization very pop,llar.
.       Registered Association of persons : Company is an associaiion of persons for some
        common object formed and registered under the Companies Act, 1956. Sometimes
        people associate together not for making profits but for promoting art, science, religion,
        charity or any other useful object. These associations, registered under the Act may be
        termed as 'Associations not-for-profit. Generally, a number of individuals get united for
        business and normally form a 'Company Limited by Shares'.

HOWA COMPNAY IS FORMED :

     After knowing the types of company let us discuss how a company is formed. As you
know a company is an artiflcial person which is created by law and closed down or liquidated
by law. A company is formed as discussed in the following paragraph.

     After having examined the future prospects of the company and after having ascertained
from lhe registrar of companies. that ihe proposed name of the company is available, the
oromoter makes himself busy with the preparation and registration of memorandum of
association, articles of association and many other documents. He fnds the first directors of
the company accumulates funds and arranges for its advertisement. Thus formation of a
company involves three important stages as follows :

ti) preparation and filling of necessary documents
(ii) payment of necessary fees and
(iii) registration of a company and obtaining the certificdte of incorporition.
      After obtaining the certiflcate of incorporation a company is said to be formed. So a
private limited company can starts its business after obtaining a certificate of incorporation.
But a public limited company can start iis business after obtaining the certificate of

Dlfference between equity shares and preferencE shares -
     The following are the points of distinction between preference shares and equity shares.

1. Preference shares are entitled to a.fixed rate of dividend. The rate of dividend on equity
     shares depends upon the amount of profits available
2. Dividend on preference shares is paid in priority to equity shares. In other words the
     dividend on equity shares is paid only after the preference dividend has been paid.
3. The preference shares have preference s to capiial and the equity shares rank behind
     the oreference shares for repayment of capitai on winding up'
4. The voting rights of preference shareholders are usually restricted. An equity shareholder
     can vote on all matters affecting the company but preference shareholder can vote only
     When their special rights arb being varied or their dividend is in arrear'

5. Redeemable preference shares may be redeemed or paid back.by the company but
     equity shareholddrs cannot be paid bagk except under a scheme involving reduction of
     caPital.

6. lf the preference shares are cumulative, the dividend not paid in any year are
     accumulated and until such arrears of dividend are paid, the equity shareholders are
     not paid any dividend.
Capital -
     The word 'capital' used in connection wilh a company has several different meanings

0     Authorised, registered or nominat capitaF fhis is the amount of capital with which the
      company intends to get itself registered. This is the amount of share capital which a
      company is authorized to issue. Nominal capital is divided into shares of a fixed amount.
.     lt must be set out in the memorandum of associatibn. lt can be increased or decreaEed
      by following the prescribeQ procedure.
(ii) Issued capital- lt is that part of the nominal capital which is actually issued by the
      company for public subscription. Acompany need not issue the entire authorized capital
      at once. lt goes on raising the capital as and when the need for additional funds is felt.
      The difference betwebn the nominal and the issued capital is known as'unissued capital'.
      Where the wholi of authorized capital is offer:ed to the public, the authorized and issued
      capital will be the same.
(iii) Subscribed caprlal - it is that amount of the nominal value of shares which hgvd actually
      been taken up by the public. lt is that part of the nominal capital which has,dbtually been
      taken up by shareholders who have agreed to give consideration in kind or in cash for
      shares issued to them. Where shares.Lsued for subscription are wholly subJcribed for'



                                               10
     issued capital would mean the same thing as'subscribed capital"

0v) Catled up capital - The amount due on the shares subscribed may be collected from
     the shareholders in instalments at different intervals. Called up capital is that amount of
     the nominalvalue of shares subscribed forwhich the company has asked its shareholders
     10 pay by means of calls or otherwise. lf 10,000 shares of Rs 100 each, have been
     subscr;bed by the public, and the company has asked the shareholders to pay Rs.10
     jn appljcation, Rs.20 on allotment and Rs.30 on first call, then the called up capital of
     tlre company would be Rs.6,00,000 The remaining amount i.e', Rs.40 per share on
     1'1,000 shares i.e. Rs. 4,00,000 &ould be the uncalled capital of the company.
(v) ,taici up capital - That part of the called up capital which is actually paid up by the
     r,rrrmllers rs known as the paid up capital. ln other words, paid up capital represents the
     tota' payments made by the shareholders to the company in response to the calls
     macie by the company. Paid up capital of the company is calculated by deducting the
     cails rn arrears from the called up capital. lf in the above example, out of 10,000 shares
     of Fts.100 each, on which Rs.60 has been called by the companyfrom the shareholders,

Partial Reissue of Shares -

          Somelimes, atl the forfeited shares are not reissued in one lot. lf the number of shares
    ieissued are less than the number of shares forfeited, it is known as partial reissue of shares.
    in case of partial reissue of shares, amount of net gain to be transferred to capital reserve rs
    ,   :dirrl r!3ted. as Under :
Amount to be transferred to Capital Reserve =

For example, if 100 shares of Rs.10 each are forfeited

reserve is calculated as follows:

Amount forfeited on 100 shares              =100x8

Discount on Reissue of 40 shares            = (40 x 10 - 280)
                                                                to capital reserve)

       are lssued eitlier at a par or at a discount. This clause is inserted in order to protect the
       interest of the creditors.

(iii) When shares are redeemed out of profits available for distribution for dividend, a sum
       equal to the nomindl amount of the shares so redeemed must be transferred out of
   .   profits to a reserve account to be called 'Capital Redemption reserve Accounf. This
       provision is made in order to immobilize profits from being used for any other purpose
       SuchaSdecIarationofdividend,redemptionofdebentures'etc',
(iv) Such reserve can be used for issuing fully paid bonus shares to the shareholders. This
       account cannot be reduced except in accordance with the sanction ofthe court relating
       to reduction of share capital.

(v) Redemption of preference shares should nol be reg arded as a reduction of the authorized
       capital of the company and as such the reduced shares should remain part of the '
       authorized capital and musi be shown in the Balance Sheet.

    . The purpose of the all legal restrictions on redemption of preference shares is not to
allow redemption of preference shares which may adversely aifect the security available to
the creditors of company. The purpose is to keep the security intact which is available to the
creditors even after the preference shares are redeemed. Section B0 of the Companies Act
provides that redemption of preference shared can be made either out of the profits of the
company which would be available for dividend or out of the proceeds of a fresh issue of
shares. lf redemption is carried out in any other manner such as out of bonowing or by sale
of available assets, it will reduce the amount of available security !c the creditors..lt is not the
case when redemption is made out of proflts because creditors'are not affected as the inbrease
in profit would result in an increase in the available assets t-r[ the company. Similarly, when
redemption is carried out of fresh issue of shares, it reiults in an increase in the available
assets and amount of security available to the creditors will not be affected after the redemption
of shares is made.

     Another objective of legal restrictions pn iedemption of preference shargs is that there
should be no reduction of share capital. li has been ensured by the following provisions of
Section 80 of the Companles Act..      .




(a) Preference shares can be redeemed either out of the proceeds of the fresh issue of
       shares or out of profits available for dividend purposes. li preference shares are
       redeemed out of the proceeds of fresh issue of shares, capital provided by fresh issue
       of shares will be substituted by the capital which will be reduced by reJemption of

          debentures depends on the circumstances of each case. lf the debentured are
         redeemed on the expiry of the period or only during a lot, then the amount to.be paid
         can be either at premium or at par as promised by the company. lf the debentures are
         redeemed by purchasing them in the open market, then the amount to be paid depends
         on the.market quotation, i.e., either at par or at a discount br at a premium' Generally,
         the companies purchase their own debentures from the market when the debentures
         are quoted below face value to take the advantages of depressed prices..         .




      {c) Sources of Finance. The major sources wherefrom the debentures can be redeemed
         may be (i) out of profits, (ii) out of capital, giii) out of provisions made for redemption
         and (iv) by converting them into shares or new debentures.
(i) Redemption a;ut of profits
      When debentures are redeemed out of profits, the following. journal enlries will be

         Credit general reserve.
         The balanCe of general reserye is a free reserve and will be available for all purposes.
        The effect of redemption of debentures out of profits is that the company withholds a
part of the divisible profits from distribution as dividend which may be retained in the business
itself as a source of internal financing.

Ail    Redemption out of CaPital
       lf debentures are redeemed out of capital, no amount of divisible profit is kept asidt
for redeeming debentuids. Profits are not utilized for redemption of debentuies and may g<
to.theshareholders by way of dividends. Redemption out of capitral reduces thgliquid resourcer
available to the company. Therefore, a company may adopt this method only when it har


        According to the guidelines issued by SEBI, a company has to create Debentur
 Redemption Reserve equivalent to 50% of the amount of debenture issue before redemptiol
 of debenture commences,Thus, according to this provision redemption of debentuies wholl'
 out of capital is now not possible. However, creation of debenture Redemption Reserve i
 not required in the following casgs:


                                              qn
       (i) Debentures with a maturity of 18.months or less.
         (ii) Fully convertiblq debentures. Incase of partly converlible debentures, Debenture
Redemption Reserve is to be created for the non-convertible part in the same way as applicable
for fully non-convertible debentures.
       When debentures are redeemed out of capital the following journal entry is made:
                             Debit Debentures Account
                                           Credit Bank.
       When debentures are reduced out of capital, nominal value of debenture redeemed
is not transferred frbm profit and Loss Appropriation Account or Debenture Redemption
Reserve Account to General Reserve.
       Sometimes instead

       (b) Debit Debenture-holders A/ c

       This method is preferable, as it doers not mix up the amount unpaid to debenture-
holders with the debentures account.

invested and that the investments were realized at a loss of Rs.300 at the end of five yea
       Reference to the Sinking fund table shows that Re.0.180975 invested at the end

              (Being debentures issued as consideration for assets purchased)

       Note : When debentures are issued in consideration other than cash they can b€
issued either at par, at premium or at discount. lf they are issued at premium the amount o
premium will be credited to 'premium on issue of debentures account' and if issued at z
discount. the discount will be debited to 'discount on issue of debentures account'.
        As per iule purchase consideration (amount to be paid for assets purchased) shoul(
be equal to net assets (Assets purchased-liabilities assumed)value. But in practice sometimer
it is more than the value of net assets and sometimes it is less than the value of net assets

      Extra payment made over and above the value of net assets is treated as goodwill
which can be calculated as follow :
       Goodwill = purchase consideration - Net assets
Where Net assets = Assets purchased - Liablities assumed
       In case the purchase consideration to be paid by company is less than thb value o
net assets, the excess of net assets over purchase consideration is a capital gain, which is
transferred to capital reserve account.

            . when debentures are issued as a collateral security there ar€ two ways of treatment
    in the accouhting books.
    (i)      No journal entry is made in the account books at the time of issue of such debentures.
    A note is appended beiow the loan on the liabilities side of the balance sheet to the fact that
    they have bben secdre:d by the issued of debentures. This will be shown in the balance sheet
    as follows :

     (ii)    Sometimes issue of debentures as collateral security is recorded by
             making journai entry as follows :

          The debentures suspense account willappearon the assets side ofthe balance sheet
    and debentures on the liabilities side. When the loan is re-paiid the entry is reversed in order
    to cancel it.

FIXEO ASSETS

(1) As per As - 10 'Accounting for Fixed Assets' a fixed asset is an "asset held with the
           intention of being used for the purpose of producing or providing goods or services and
           is not held for sale in the normal course of business. Even assets which are not legally
          owned but are held for the production of goods or services for example leasehold
          premises or asset purchased under hire-purchase agreements are also shown under
          this heading.
(2) under this heading there are eleven categories starting with good will and ending'with
          vehicles etc. under each head the original cost, and additions thereto and deduitions
          there from during the year and the total depreciation written off or provided to the end of
     ,    the year are to be stated. lt would be clumsy to show all the details in the balance sheet
          itself and therefore a separate schedule will provide such details.

(3) In ascertaining the cost of an asset all expenditure incurred in bringing it to present
          location and put it to working condition should be included.
(4) In every case where the original cost of the asset cannot be ascertained without
          unreasonable expense or delby, the valuation shown by the books can be given. For
          thls purpose, such valuation shall be the net amount at which an asset stood in the
          company's books at the commencement of this Act after deduction of the amounts
          previously provided or written otr by way of depreciation, and where such an asset is
          sold, the amount of sale proceeds shall be shown as a deduction.

INVESTMENTS

(1   ) As - 3 defines investments as assets held by an enterprise for earning income by way
               1

           of dividends, interests, and rentals for capital appreciation, or for other benefits to the
           rnvesting enterprise. Investments represents capital inv'ested outside by on enterprise
         ' and they may be long term or cunent investments current investments by its nature are
          readily realizable and are intended to be held for not more than one year. lnvestments
          other than current are considered to be long{erm.
(2) schedule Vl of companies Acl requires investments to be shown under the following
          categories :

         (i) Government or trust securities
         (ii) Shares, debentures or bonds

RECONSTRUCTION
      It refers to reorganization of an'over capitalized company with accumulated iosses but
whose future is very bright. In involves only one existing company as against amalgamation
which requires at leasitwo bxisiing companies. For this purpose, company makes compromtse
or arrangement with its creditors and members. Section 391 of the companies Act 1956
allows the companies to make compromise or arrangement with its creditors and_.members
provided, it is within the powers of ihe company as per its Articles of association and it is also
sanctioned by the Court of law.
RYPES OF RECONSTRUCTION
      Reconstruction of a company may take place in one of the following two ways : -
1'                                 -
     External Reconstruction The exisiing company is liquidated and its business ts
     taken over by a new company speciallyformed to takeover the business ofthe company
      being reconstructed. This form of reconstruction is known as External Reconstruction.
      It involves liquidation of existing company and formation of a new company.

2. Internal Reconstruction - Under this the exisiing iompany is reorganized by using
      provisions relating io reduction of capital as contained in sections 100 to,105;f the
     companies Act 1956. This form of reconstruction is known a$ lnternal Reconstruction             :



     and it involves less procedural formalities, as winding up of the existing company and
     formation of a new company is not required.

        Amalgamation (including absorption) and external reconstruction are although differ:ent
 in nature but involve similar accounting treatment. These involve closing of books of the
transferor company which is being amalgamated/ absorbed/ reconstructed and recording of
entries on acquisition of business by the transferee company which may be one of the existing
companies (in case of absorption) or a new company (in casp of amalgamation and externar

Purchase Consideration
     Purchase consideration is the amount which is paid by the transferee company for the
purchase of the.business of the transferor company. In other words consideration for
amalgamation means the aggregate of the shares and othei securities issued and payment
in cash or other assets by the transferee company to the shareholders of the transferor
company. lt should not include the amount of liabilities taken over by the transferee company,
which will be paid directly by this company. payments made to debenture-holders should not-
be considered as part of purchase consideration. while deterinining the amount of purchase
consideration special care should be given to the valuation of assets and liabilities of the
transferor company. The calculation of purchase consideration is very important and may be
calculated in the following ways:



                                             231
 (l) ' Lump Sum Method. When the transferee company agrees to pay a fixed sum to tt
        transferor company, it is called a lump sum payment of purchase consideration. F
        example, ifX Ltd. Purchases the business ofY Ltd. And agrees to pay Rs.25,00,000
        all, it is an example of lump sum payment.

(ll) Net Worth (or Net Assets/ Mefhod. According to this method, the puiohase consideratic
        is calculated by calculating the net worth of the assets taken over by the Transfere
        company. The net worth is arrived at by adding the agreed value of assets taken ov{
        by the transferee company minus agreed value of liabilities to be assumed bi tf
        transferee company. While calculating purchase consideration under this method ti
        following points merit attention :

a. The term 'Assets' will always include cash in hand and cash at bank unless otheruvis
        specified but shall not in;lude factious assets as preliminary expenses, discount on ti
        issue of shares or debentures, underwriting commission, debit balance of profit ar
        loss account etc.

b. . lf a particular asset is not taken over by the transferee company, it should not be include
       in the purchase consideration.

c. The term 'Liabilities' will mean all liabilities to third parties.(ie.. excluding company an
. shareholders).
d. The term 'trade liabilities' will include trade creditors and bills payable. lt will exclud
       other liabilities to third party as bank overdraft, debentures, outstanding expenses, ta
       liability etc.

e. lf a fund or portion of a fund denotes liability to third parties, the same must be include
       in the liability as staff provident fund, workmen's savings bank account, workmen'
       profit sharing fund, workmen's compensation fund iupto the amount of claim, if any).

f.     The term liabilities'will not include'past accumulatbd profits or reseryes such as gener:
       reserve, dividend equalization fund, reserve funds, sinking fund, capital reservel shar
     . premium account, capital redemption ieserve account, profit and loss account etc. a
       these are payable to shareholders and not to third parties.

g. The term 'business' will always mean both the assets and the liabilities:
h. lf any liability is not laken over by the transferee company, the same should not br
       included in the purchase congiderglion.

i.     Goodwilll (being an intangible assots value agreed to be paid by the transferee compan,
       is added in the purchase consideration.




                                              232
J.       The consideration for the amalgamation should include any non-cash element at fair
         valu<-:. ln case of issue of securities, the value fixed by the statutory authorities may be
         taken to be the fair value. ln case of other assets, the fair value may be determined by
         reference to the market value of the assets given up. Where the market value of the
         assets given up cannot be reliably assessed, such assets may be valued at their
         respective net book values.

         Where the scheme of the amalgamation provides for an adjustment to the consideration
         contingent on one or more future events, the amount of the additional payment shouid
         be included in the consideration if payment is probable and a reasonable estimate of
         the amount can be made. In all other cases, the adjustment should be recognized as
         soon as the amount is determinable [see Accounting Standard (AS)4, Contingencies
         and Events Occurring After the Balance Sheet Datel.

         Treatment of Reserves Specifed in a Scheme of Amalgamation. Where the scheme of
         amalgamation sanctioned under a statue prescribes the keatment to be given to the
         reserves of the transferor company after amalgamation, the same should be followed,
         Calcrlaticn f lhe purchase consideration by the net worth method may. be made clear
         by the follcwing example :

accept shares and securities etc. of the transferee company for distribution among thr
members of the transferor company. Thus a company that goes into liquidation can br
purchased by some other company and the purchase price may be paid, fully or partly, b
issuing shares or securities in the purchasing company. The members of the transfero
company who do not like to purchase the shares of the transfefee company have the right a
requiring the liquidator to purchase thelr shares at a price 10 be determined by agreement o
in default by arbitration.

        From the above discussion it is clearthatthere are two types of companies i.e. transfere(
company and the transferor company companies in case of amalgamation, and externe
reconstruction; so accounting entries which are to be passed in the books of transferer
company and transferor company/ companies will be the same in case of amalganiation an(
external reconstruction.

Accounting in the books of the Transteree Company

     Accounting in the books of the transferee company is to be done with reference to
Accounting standard (AS)-14. The accounting procedure will differ depending upon the type
of amalgamation. There are two main methods of accounting for amalgamation in the books
of the transferee company :

(a) The Pooling of lnterests Method, and
(b) The Purchasing Method.
{a) The Pooling of Interests Method'
     This method is applicable in case of amalgdmation in the nature of merger. In this case,
the amalgamation is accounted for as if separate businesses of amalgamated companies
were intended to be cai'ried on by thq transferee company. That is why only minimum changes
are made in aggregating the individual financial statements of the transferor companies. The
iollowing factors are taken into consideration while making entries in ihis method :

(i) ln preparing the transferee company's financial statements, ihe assets, liabilities, and
      reserves (whelher capltal or revenue or arising on revaluation) ofthe transferor company
      should be recorded at their existing carrying amounts and in the same form as at the
      date of the amalgamation unless any adjustment is required due to ditferent accounting



                                              239
       policies. The baiance of ihe Proflt and Loss Account of the transferor company sho
       be transferred to the General Reserve, if any.

(ii) The difference between the amount recorded as share capital issued (plus any additio
       consideration in the form of cash or other assets) and the amount of share capital of
       transferor company should be adjusted in reserves. ln case there is no balance in
       Reserye Account in the Balance sheet of fhe transferee company to offset the dt
        balance,in the reserve Account arising as a result of the difference between the purchi
       consideration and the amaunt cf share capttal of the transferor company should
       debited to Profit an,l Loss Account instead bf debiting Reserue Account. lt is so becal
       Reserve Account is never shointn as a debit halance'

(iii) lf, at the time cf amalgamation, the transferor and the transferee companies hi
       conflicting accounting policies, a uniform set of accounting policies should be adop
       following the amalgamation. The effects on the financial statements of any changer
       accounting policie:'.should be reported in accordance with Accounting Standard (A
       5, 'Prior Period and Extraordinary ltems and Changes in Accounting Policies.

      The following journai eniries are to be passed in ihe books of the transferee compi
for incorporating the firrancial statements of the transferor company.

 (i) In preparing the lransferee compahy's financial statements, the assets and liabilities of
      the transferor conlpany should be incorporated at their existing carrying amounts or,
      alternatively, the consideration should be allocated to individual identifiable asiets and
      liabilities on the basis of their fair values at the date of amalgamation.

 (ii) The reserves (whether capitai or revenue or arising on revaluation) of the transferor
      company, olher lhan the statutory reseryes, should nol be included in tre financlal
      statements of the transferee company.

(iii) An excess of the amount of the consideration over tne net assets of the transferor
      company acquired by the transferee company should be recognized in the transferee
      company's financial statements as goodwill arising on amalgamation. lf the amount of
      the consideration is lower than the value of lhe net assets acquired, the difference
      should be treated as Capilal reserve.

(iv) The goodwill arising on amalgamation should be amortized to income on a systematic
      basis over tits useful life. The amortizalion period should not exceed five years unless
      a somewhat longer period can be justified.

(v) where the requirements of the retevanl statute for recording the statutory reseryes
     such as Development Allowance Reserve, Investment Allowance reserve
                                                                                     etc. in the

                                                                                   company oy

 INTRODUCTION

          As perAs-3 the funds flow statement is defined as a statement that summarizes for the
 period covered by it, the changes in financial position includihg the sources from which funds
 were obtained by the enterprise and the specific uses to which such funds were applied-

      The statement of changes in financial position is a broad term which includes both the
 funds flow and qash flow statements. Where the statement is prepared to ascertain the
 increase in working capital the statemeni is generally referred to as funds flow statement.

       The funds flow statement gives a meaningful link between the balance sheets at the
  beginning and at the end of the period and the profit and loss account of the  period.  .t


      The funds flow statement is a stat,ement which shows the movement of funds and is a
 report of financidl operations of the business undertaking. lt indicates various means by
 whiCh funds were obtained during a particular period and the ways in which these funds were
 employed. In simple words, it is a statement of sources and application of funds'


                                                 275
 MEANING AND CONCEPT OF FUNDS

        The term 'funds' has been defined in a number of ways.

 (a) In a narrow sense - it means cash only and a funds flow statement prepared on tt
       basis is called a cash flow statement such a statement enumerates net effects of t
       various business transactions on cash and takes into account ri:ceipts and disbursemer
       of cash.

(b) In a.broader sense - the term 'funds' refers to money values form it may exist. He
       'funds'means all financial resources, used in business whether in the
                                                                                    form of mee
       material, money, machinery and others.

(c) In a popular seDS€ - the term 'funds' means working capital, the excess of curre
       assets over current liabilities. The working capital funds has emerged due to the fe
       that total resources of a business are invested partly in fixed asserts'in the form of fixr
       capital and partly kept in form of liquid or near liquid form gf working capital.

       However, the concept of funds is known as working capital in the most popular and
this chapter we shall refer to'funds'as working capital and a funds flow statement as
statement of sources and application of funds.

MEANING AND CONCEPT OF 'FLOW OF FUNDSI

       The terrn 'flow' means movement and included both 'inflow'.and 'outflow,. The terr
 'flow of funds' mean transfer of economic values from one assert of equity
                                                                                to another. Flow
funds is said to have taken place when any transaction makes changes in the amount
funds available before happening of the transaction. lf the effect of transaction results in tf
increase of funds, it is called as a source of funds and if if results in the decrease of funds,
is known as an application offunds. Further, in case the transaction does not charge fund
it is said to have not resulted in the flow of funds. According to the working capital concep
of funds, the term 'flow of funds'refers tothe movement of funds in the working capital. lf
                                                                                               ar

funds and if it resrrlt" in the decrease of wbrking capital, it is said a source or out flow     I


funds.

Rule

     The flow of funds occurs when a transaction changes on the one hand a non-currei
account and the othei a current account and vice-versa.

       when a change in non-current account e.g., fixed asserts longterm liabilities, reserve
and surplus, factious asserls, etc., is followed by a change in another non-current account,
does not amount io flow of funds. This is because of the fact that in such cases neither fl-

SOURCES OF FUNDS

      The following are the sources from which funds generally flow (come), into the
                                                                                        business:

 (1) Funds from operations orTrading Profits
                                                                                              and
        Trading profits or the profits from operations of the business is the most important
                                                                                             they
 major source of funds. Sales are lhe main source of inflow of funds inlo the business as
                                                                                         flow out
 increase current assets (cash, dbbtors or bills receivable) b11t at the same time funds
 of business for expenses and cost of goods sold. Thus, the net effect of operations will
                                                                                             be a
                                                                                      goods sold
 source of funds if inflow from sales exceeds the outflow for expenses and cost of
 and vice-versa. But it must be remembered that funds from operations do not necessarily
 mean the profit as shown by the profit and loss account of a firm, because there are many
                                                                                            profit
 non-fund or non-operating items which may have been either debited or credited to
 and loss account. The examples of such items on the debit side ol a profit and loss account
  are : Amortization of fictitious and intangible assets such as goodwill' preliminary, expenses
  and discount on issue of shares and debenture written off; appropriation of retained earnings'
  such as transfers to reseryes, etc., depreciation and depletion loss on sale of fixed asspts;
  payment of dividend, etc. The non-fund items are those, which may be operational expenses
  but they do not affect funds of the business, e.g., for depreciation charged tcprofit and loss
 account, funds really do not move out of business. Non-operating items are- those wl-lich

although may result in the outflow af funds but are not related to the trading operatiohs of tl
business, such as loss on sale of machinery or payment of dividends. The methods
calculating funds from operations have been discussed in the following pages.
Basically, there are two methods of calculating funds from operations :
(a) The first method is to prepare the profit and loss account afresh by taking in
       consideration only fund and operational items which involve funds and ar.e related.
       the normal operations of the business. The balancing figure in this case will be eith
       funds generated from operations or funds lost in operations depending upon wheth
       the income or credit side of profit and loss account exceeds the expense or debit sir
       of profit and loss account or vice-versa.
(b) The second method (which is generally used) is to proceed from the figure of net prc
       or net loss as arrived at from the profit and loss account already prepared. Funds frc
       operations by this method can be calculated as under :

(ii) lssues of shares for consideration other than current assets such as against purchase
     of land, machines, etc' does not amount to inflow of funds'
(iii) Conversion of debenturesor loans into shares al$o does not amountto inflow of funds.
     ln all the three cases mentioned above, both the amounts invoived are non-current and
     do not involve any current assets or funds'
(3) lssue of debentures and raising of loans, etc.
      lssue of debentures or raising of loans (long-term), whether secured or unsecured
results in the flow offunds into the business, The inflow offunds is the actual proceeds from
                                                                                   premium or
the issue of such debentures or raising of loans, i.e., including the amount of
excluding discount, if any. However, loans raised for consideration otherthan a current asset
such as for purchase of building, will not constitute inflow of funds because in that case the
accounts involved are only fixed or non-current.
(4) Sale of fixed (non'current assets) and long'term or trade investments
     when any fixed or non-current asset like land, building, plaint and machinery, furniture,
long{erm investments, etc. are sold it generates funds and becomes. a source of funds:
However, it must be remembered ihat if one fixed asset is exchanged for another fixed asset,
it does not constitute an inflow of funds because no current assets are involved.

(5) Non-tradingReceiPts
      Any non-trading receipt like dividend received, refund of tax, rent received, etc. also
increases fundS and is treated as a sources offunds because such an income is not included
in the funds from operations.

 (6) Decrease in working caPital
      lf the working capital decr'ease during the cunent'period as compared to the previous
 period, it means that there has been a release of funds from workinq capital and ii cohslilrrtbs
 a source of funds.
 APPLICATION OR USES OF FUNDS
 (1) Funds lost in operations
       sometimes the result of trading in a certain year is a loss and some funds are lost
 during that period in trading operations. Such loSs of funds in trading amounts tQ an outflow
 of funds and is treated as an application of funds.
 (2) Redemption of preference share capital
      lf during the year any preference shares are redeemed, it will result in the outflow of
 funds and is taken as an application of funds, When the shares are redeemed at premium or


                                               296
     discount; it is the net amount paid (including piemium or excluding discount, as the case may
     be). However, if shares are redeemed in exchanges of some other type of shares or
.    debentures, it does not constitute an outflow of iunds as no current account is involved in
     that case.
     (3) Repayment of loans or redemption of debentures, etc.
           In the same way as redemption of preference share capital, redemption of debentures
     or repayment of loans also constitute an application of funds.

     (4) Purchase of any non-current or fixed asset
           When any fixed or non-current asset like land, building, plant and machinery furniture,
     long{erm investments, etc. are purchased, funds outflow from the business. However, if
     fiied assets are purchased for a consideration of issue of shares or debentures or if some
     fixed asset is exchanged for another, it does not involve any funds and hence not an application
     of funds.

     (5) Payments of Dividends and Tax
           Payments of dividends and tax are also applications of funds. lt is the actual payment
     of dividend (may be interim dividend) and tax which should be taken as an outflow of funds
     and not the mere declaration of dividend or creating of a provision for taxation.
     (6) Any other non-trading payment
            Any payment or expense not relaied to the trading operations ofthe business amounts
'   . to outflow of funds and is taken as an application of funds. The examples could be drawings
      in.case oi sole trader or partnership firms, loss of cash; etc.

     soME TYPTCAL tTEMS, WHICH REQUTRE PARTICuLAR CARE
           The following items require particular care whiie preparing a funds flow statement.

     (1) Digging out Hidden Information
               While preparing a funds flow statement, one has to analyse the given balance sheets.
       Items relating to current accounts, i.e., current assets and current liabilities have to be shown
    .. in the schedule of changes in working capital. But the non-current assets and non-current

       liabilities have to be further analysed to find out the hidden information in regard to sale or
       purchase of non-current assets, issue or redemption of share capital, raising or repayment of
     long-term loans, transfers to reserves and provisions, etc.

             The hidden information can be digged out either by preparing working notes in the
     statement form or preparing concerned accounts of non-current assets and non-current
     liabilities. Both of these methods have been clarified in the following illustrations :

4.     Proposed Dividends
         Proposed dividend though shown on the liabilities side of a Balance sheet is not a
liability in real sense unit it is formally declared to be paid to the shareholders in the annual
general meeting of the Company. Till such declaration of dividends, it simply represents an
appropriation of profits and is like a reserye or surplus. But generally, declarations of dividends
pioposed by the directors are accepted in the shareholders meeting. ln thal case, proposed
dividend cannot be said to be and appropriation of profits as these become payable within a
short tinte after they are proposed. So there €re two alternaliveS to deal with this item in the
same way as that of provision for taxation ;
        (i) A9 a current liability. When proposed divldend is lreated as a current liability it
represents an obligation of the company which is payable in a short period. Hence, it is
shown in the schedule of changes in working capital as a current liability and it requires no
furlher treatment in the funds flow statement.
       (ii) As an appropriation of profits. When
                                            When proposed dividend is treated as an
appropriation of profits it is not a current liability and hence will not be shown in the schedtuie
of changes in working capital. In this case, dividends proposed during they year, being an
appropriation, are added back (or shown on the debit side ofadjusted profit and loss account)
while finding funds from operations. Thus, dividends paid during the year represent an

6. Provision agalnst current assets
        Provision against current assets, such as, provision for bad and doubtful debts, provision
for loss on stock, €tc. may be treaied by any of the following methoda :

(a) The opening end closing balance of provision againsi current assets should be deducted
        from the regp6ctive op€ning and closing balance ofthe concerned asset. The net amount
        of the current assets should then be shown in the schedule of changes in working
        capital. lt dees not require any further treatment in'the funds flow stitement.

(b)   . The amount of the opening and closing balance of the current assets may be taken as
        gross in thc schedule of changes in working capital, i.e., without deducting the amount
       of provision. But, then, the opening and closing balance of the provision against current
       assets shall have to be taken as a current liability in the schedule of changes in working
       capital an it will not need any further treatment in lhe funds stdtement.                  t

(c) lf excess Brgvision has been created, it may be treated as an appropriation of profits
       and should be added while calculating funds from operations. The amount of the excess
       pro,vision will not be shown in the schedule of changes in working capital.

 DEPRECIATION.AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS

        Depreciation may be regarded a$ the capital cost of an bssets allocated over the lif
 the asset. In simple language, it means the gradual decrease in the value of an asset du
 wear and tear, use and passage of time. In real sense, depreciation is simply a book er
 having the effect of reducing the book value of the asset and the profits of the current year
 the same amount. lt does not affect current assets or current liabilities and does not rbsu
 the flow of funds or.to say more precisely it is a non-fund item. Hence, although deprecia.
 rs an operating cost there is no actual outflow of cash and sq the arnount of the depreciar
 charged during the year is added back to profits while finding funds from operations.       E

 then, is depreciation a source of funds?

.     The study of above sets clarifies that debentures are redeernable wither at part or at
premium. How the debentu!"es'are to be redeemed in future is provided in the prospectus '
issued by the compqpy at the time of issue. Sometimes a company can also redeem its
debeniures by purchase frqni open market. Generally in such cases it is normally seen that
company buys them at below the par value, thus making profit on redemption.

Redemption of Debentures
      Redemption of debentures refers to the discharge of liability on account of debentures.
The following three problems require attention when a company wants to redeem the
debentures.
   (a) Time of redemption of debentures. Generally debentures are redeemed at the
          expiry of their period by making the payment of the amount promised fro. But
          sometimes, cgmpany may reserve the right in the articles of association to redeem
          the debentures even before the date of redemption either by installments or by
          purchasing them in the open market. Payment of debentures by installment is nothing
          but redemption of debentures by.drawing a lot' Sometimes a company does not want
          to serve a notice with the debenture-holders and wants to redeem the debentures
          before the date of redemption. This is possible by purchasing out own debentures in
          the open market. Thus debentures can be redeemed either at the expiry of period of
          debentures or before the expiry of the period by drawing a lot or by purchasing in the
          open market before the expiry of the period of debentures.
   (b) Amount lo be paid on fedemption. The amount to be paid on redemption of
       debentures depends on the circumsiances of each case. lf the debentures are
          redeemed on the expiry of the period or only during a lot, then the amount to be paid
          can be either at premium or at par as promised by the company. lf the debentures are
          redeemed by purchasing them in the open market, then the amount to be paid depends
          on the market quotation, i.e., either at par or ata discount or at a premium. Generally,
          the companies purchase their own debentures from the market when the dpbentures
          are quoted below face value to take the advantages of depressed prices.
   (c) . Sources of Finance. The major sources wherefrom the debentufes can be redeemed
          may be (i) out of profits, (ii) out of cppital, 9iii) out of provisions made for redemption
          and (iv) by converting them into shares or new debentures.
(i) Redemption out of profits
        When debentures are redeemed out of profits, the following journal entries will be
passed.

(a) Entry for amount paid on redemption
        Debit debentures account
        Credit Bank
(b) Entry for transfer of profit
