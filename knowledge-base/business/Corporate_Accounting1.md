Shares -- Meaning
       A Share in a company is one of the units of fixed amount into which the total share
capital of a company is divided.


Shares - Definition
       “Share means a share in the capital of a company and includes stock except where a
distinction between stock and shares expressed or implied”.


Types of Shares
          There are two types of shares namely preference shares and equity shares.


1. Preference Shares:
            The Preference Shares are those which enjoy preferential rights over other classes of
shares for the payment of dividend during the life-time of the company and repayment of capital
over the other classes of shares at the time of winding up.


2. Equity Shares:
             Equity Shares are those which do not enjoy the preferential right in payment of
dividend and repayment of capital. The holders of these shares are paid dividend only after
payment to the preferential shareholders is made. The rate of dividend is not fixed on equity
shares and it varies from time to time.

company. The procedure given in the Articles must be followed. A notice of demand, requiring
the shareholder to pay calls of a specified amount within the specified period must be given. The
Board of Directors must pass a resolution for forfeiture of shares.


REISSUE OF FORFEITED SHARES
               Forfeited shares become the property of the company and the company can cancel
or reissue them at its convenience. They can be reissued at par, premium or discount. However,
in case they are reissued at discount, the amount of discount should not exceed the amount that
had been already paid by the defaulter.

account, such profit should be treated as capital profit and it must be transferred to Capital

                           REDEMPTION OF PREFERENCE SHARES


Redeemable Preference Shares
                 The Redeemable Preference shares are those, the amount of which can be paid
back to the holders of such shares. The paying back of capital is called the redemption.


Provision For The Redemption Of Preference Shares
             The following are the important provisions of Sec.80 of the Companies Act, 1956,
relating to redemption of redeemable preference shares:


       The shares to be redeemed must be fully paid-up. If the company has partly paid
preference shares, it must see that they are made fully paid up before they are redeemed.


       The redeemable preference shares can be redeemed either out of the profits of the
company which would otherwise be available for dividend or out of the proceeds of a fresh issue
of shares made for this purpose only.


       Any premium payable on redemption must be provided out of profits or out of the
company‟s share premium account.


       Where redemption is made out of profits, a sum equal to the nominal amount of the
shares so redeemed must be transferred, out of the profits of the company to a reserve called the
Capital Redemption Reserve a/c.


       Capital Redemption Reserve a/c can be utilized for the issue of fully paid bonus shares to
the equity shareholders.


       Redemption of preference shares shall not be taken as the reduction of the authorized
share capital.



                                                16
CAPITAL REDEMPTION RESERVE
     Capital Redemption Reserve is a reserve created out of profit of the company, if the
preference shares are redeemed out of profit. The amount so credited will be equal to the
nominal value of the shares to be redeemed.


PROFITS AVAILABLE FOR CAPITAL REDEMPTION RESERVE
  Usually, the revenue profits or the profits available for dividend can be used to create the
capital redemption reserve. They are:


General Reserve
Profits and Loss a/c
Dividend Equalization Fund
Reserve Fund
Revenue portion of profit on sale of investments
Revenue portion of profit on sale of fixed assets
Workmen‟s Accident Compensation Fund
Insurance Fund


PROFITS NOT AVAILABLE FOR CAPITAL REDEMPTION RESERVE
       The capital profits or profits not available for dividend cannot be used for the purpose of
creating the capital redemption reserve. They are


General Reserve
Capital Redemption Reserve
Development Rebate Reserve
Depreciation Reserve
Shares forfeited account
Profit prior to incorporation
Profit on sale of fixed assets
Share premium account

1.       From the following information find out how much minimum fresh issue is necessary, if
         Redeemable preference share of Rs.2,00,000 is redeemed at 10% premium.


Profit shown in the balance sheet.
         Profit Rs.30,000 ; General reserve Rs.20,000, share premium Rs.8,000.
Dividend equalization fund Rs.50,000.

                                      Purchase of own Debentures


     Own Debentures
        The purchase of its own debentures by a company in the open market to be kept as an
     investment or to cancel at a later date is called own debentures.


     Interest on own debentures
        The total amount of interest due on debentures is deemed to be outstanding. But payment
     of interest on debentures is made only to the outsiders.


     Purchase of own Debentures
        When own debentures are purchased on a date other that the date of interest, distinction
     must be made between the capita; and revenue portion of the price paid for the debentures.


     Cum – Interest
        Cum – interest means that it is with interest. Thus the cum – interest quotation price is a
     purchase price that includes interest also.


     Ex – Interest
        Ex – Interest means that is is without interest. Thus, the Ex – Interest quotation price is a
     purchase price that excludes interest.

       Rs.15 per share for every 5 shares in the vendor company.
