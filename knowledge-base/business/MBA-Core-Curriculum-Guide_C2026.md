MGMT 6100 – Foundations of Teamwork and Leadership (0.5CU)
This course focuses on developing students’ knowledge and skill set for teamwork and
leadership. It is an immersive experiential learning course anchored on the Wharton
Teamwork and Leadership Simulation. This interactive simulation is custom-designed to
challenge students to apply course concepts as they collaborate to run a company. The key
goals are for students to practice:
1. Leadership behaviors: how to align people to achieve great things
2. Team dynamics: how to be an eCective team member, as well as how to best design work
groups
3. Organizational eCectiveness: how to adapt to change and build high-performing cultures


MKTG 6110 – Marketing Management (0.5CU)
This course addresses how to design and implement the best combination of marketing
eCorts to carry out a ﬁrm's strategy in its target markets. Speciﬁcally, this course seeks to
develop the student's:
1. Understanding of how the ﬁrm can beneﬁt by creating and delivering value to its
customers and stakeholders
2. Skills in applying the analytical concepts and tools of marketing to such decisions as
segmentation and targeting, branding, pricing, distribution, and promotion.


BEPP 6110 (formerly MGEC 6110) – Microeconomics for
Managers (0.5CU)
This course establishes the micro-economic foundations for understanding business
decision-making. The course will cover consumer theory and market demand under full
information, market equilibrium and government intervention, production theory and cost
optimization, producing in perfectly competitive and monopoly markets, vertical relations,
and game theory, including simultaneous, sequential, and inﬁnitely repeated games.
Finally, we will wrap up game theory.


BEPP 6120 (formerly MGEC 6120) – Advanced Microeconomics
for Managers (0.5CU)
This course will cover the economic foundations of business strategy and decision-making
in market environments with other strategic actors and less than full information, as well as
advanced pricing strategies. Topics include oligopoly models of market competition,
creation, and protection, as well as sophisticated pricing strategies for consumers with




                                                                                                3

diCerent valuations or consumers who buy multiple units (e.g., price discrimination,
bundling, two-part tariCs). We also discuss strategies for managing risk and making
decisions under uncertainty, asymmetric information and its consequences for markets,
moral hazard and principal-agent theory with application to incentive contracts, and,
ﬁnally, auctions.


STAT 6130 – Regression Analysis for Business (1.0CU)
This course provides the fundamental methods of statistical analysis, the art and science
of extracting information from data. The course will begin with a focus on the basic
elements of exploratory data analysis, probability theory and statistical inference. With this
as a foundation, it will proceed to explore the use of the key statistical methodology known
as regression analysis for solving business problems, such as the prediction of future sales
and the response of the market to price changes. The use of regression diagnostics and
various graphical displays supplement the basic numerical summaries and provides
insight into the validity of the models. Speciﬁc important topics covered include least
squares estimation, residuals and outliers, tests and conﬁdence intervals, correlation and
autocorrelation, collinearity, and randomization. The presentation relies upon computer
software for most of the needed calculations, and the resulting style focuses on
construction of models, interpretation of results, and critical evaluation of assumptions.


STAT 6210 – Accelerated Regression Analysis for Business
(0.5CU)
STAT 6210 is intended for students with recent, practical knowledge of the use of
regression analysis in the context of business applications. This course covers the material
of STAT 6130 but omits the foundations to focus on regression modeling. The course
reviews statistical hypothesis testing and conﬁdence intervals for the sake of standardizing
terminology and introducing software, and then moves into regression modeling. The pace
presumes recent exposure to both the theory and practice of regression and will not be
accommodating to students who have not seen or used these methods previously. The
interpretation of regression models within the context of applications will be stressed,
presuming knowledge of the underlying assumptions and derivations. The scope of
regression modeling that is covered includes multiple regression analysis with categorical
eCects, regression diagnostic procedures, interactions, and time series structure. The
presentation of the course relies on computer software that will be introduced in the initial
lectures. Recent exposure to the theory and practice of regression modeling is
recommended.

WHCP 6160 – Management Communication (0.5CU)
 This is one of two options for completing the communication requirement and, of the two,
this option will have more available seats. This course focuses on how to clearly and
persuasively articulate, advocate for, and defend your views as a presenter and writer in
various business contexts and for a diverse range of audiences. You will learn the
                                                                                            4
essentials of persuasion, gain conﬁdence as a presenter, and receive individualized
feedback from instructors and second-year TAs (Wharton Communication Fellows).
Regardless of your skill level upon entry to the course, you will develop and demonstrate
eCective, business-oriented communication skills. Students will practice these skills
through in-class exercises, discussions, and small-group labs.

WHCP 6180 – Entrepreneurial Communication (0.5CU)
This is the second option for completing the communication requirement. This course
requires pre-approval, and seats will be limited. Designed for students who are actively
working on a startup idea while at Wharton, this course focuses on the unique challenges
entrepreneurs face when communicating their idea, vision, and strategy. Students in this
course will learn communication frameworks and best practices for pitching innovative
ideas in a way that persuades others to appreciate their value. Through individualized
feedback from their instructor, TA, and peers, students will hone their personal
communication style and their pitch decks. At the conclusion of the course, students will
have the opportunity to pitch their business idea to real investors.

WHCP 6210 – Foundations of Business Writing (0CU)
Students who do not waive the writing requirement will take WHCP 6210: Foundations of
Business Writing in the fall of their ﬁrst year. This discussion-based writing course is
designed to help students improve their ability to organize and develop the persuasive
arguments they’ll need to lead teams and eCect change.
For students who are identiﬁed as needing additional support in English, the
Communication Program will oCer ESL (English as a Second Language) sections of WHCP
6210. Please note that the content of ESL and non-ESL sections of WHCP 6210 is
fundamentally the same; the ESL sections simply oCer more support tailored to the needs
of ESL students.

FLEXIBLE CORE COURSES
The remainder of the core curriculum provides students with ﬂexibility in how they wish to
satisfy the requirements. There are eight subjects in which you are required to choose one
or two options from a set of courses.




WAIVERS
Since many students have studied some of the core subjects in previous degree programs
or have work experience in these ﬁelds, we oCer students the opportunity to submit
credentials and/or sit for an exam to waive certain core courses. Successfully waiving a
course means that you have satisﬁed the requirement and can utilize that course unit
towards an elective course. The online Core Requirement Evaluation Process site provides
a summary of the core classes that oCer a waiver, placement and/or substitution options,
and instructions on how to do so. It is important to note that you may only opt to submit
credentials and/or take waiver/placement/substitution exams in the summer prior to
starting the MBA Program. Requests to waive/place into/substitute core requirements after
the summer deadlines will not be met.


PLACEMENTS & SUBSTITUTIONS
Students who are able to demonstrate knowledge of a core subject but not suCiciently
enough to waive the requirement entirely, may be placed into an accelerated course or
granted a substitution. A substitution is an upper-level elective course designated by the
department that these students can take in lieu of the core course to satisfy the
requirement.

LGST 6110 – Responsibility in Global Management (0.5CU)
This course uses the global business context to introduce students to important legal,
ethical and cultural challenges they will face as business leaders. Cases and materials will
address how business leaders, constrained by law and motivated to act responsibly in a
global context, should analyze relevant variables to make wise decisions. Topics will
include an introduction to the basic theoretical frameworks used in the analysis of ethical
issues, such as right-based, consequentialist-based, and virtue-based reasoning, and
conﬂicting interpretations of corporate responsibility. The course will include materials that
introduce students to basic legal (common law vs. civil law) and normative (human rights)
regimes at work in the global economy as well as sensitize them to the role of local cultural
traditions in global business activity. Topics may also include such issues as comparative
forms of corporate governance, bribery and corruption in global markets, human rights
issues, diverse legal compliance systems, corporate responses to global poverty, global
environmental responsibilities, and challenges arising when companies face conﬂicting
ethical demands between home and local, host country mores. The pedagogy emphasizes
globalized cases, exercises, and theoretical materials from the ﬁelds of legal studies,
business ethics and social responsibility.

LGST 6120 – Responsibility in Business (0.5CU)
This course introduces students to important ethical and legal challenges they will face as
leaders in business. The course materials will be useful to students preparing for
managerial positions that are likely to place them in advisory and/or agency roles owing
duties to employers, clients, suppliers, and customers. Although coverage will vary
depending on instructor, the focus of the course will be on developing skills in ethical and
legal analyses that can assist managers as they make both individual-level and ﬁrm-level
decisions about the responsible courses of action when duties, loyalties, rules, norms, and
interests are in conﬂict. For example, the rules of insider trading may form the basis for
lessons in some sections. Group assignments, role-plays, and case studies may, at the
instructor's discretion, be used to help illustrate the basic theoretical frameworks. Course
materials will highlight industry codes and professional norms, as well as the importance
of personal and/or religious values.

LGST 6130 – Business, Social Responsibility, and the
Environment (0.5CU)
This half-credit (.5 cu) course presents students with the opportunity to explore an
alternative perspective to what some might consider the traditional or standard model of
business. A starting point of the course is to ask whether business ﬁrms owe a “social
responsibility” that includes, but goes beyond, maximizing proﬁts. The course begins with
overarching questions including to whom a business ﬁrm owes legal and ethical duties,
how to balance or trade-oC obligations owed to diCerent stakeholders when they may
conﬂict, and how to consider the distributional and other socially important implications of
business decisions. DiCerent sections of this course will examine questions about the
responsibility of business toward a number of pressing environmental and social issues,
including for example, climate change, fresh water availability, green marketing claims,
democratic values, racial and gender diversity, human rights, poverty reduction, and global
health issues such as access to medicine. These topics will be treated primarily through
the lenses of law and ethics. Please consult individual instructors’ syllabi in the Wharton
syllabus repository for further details on what will be covered in each individual section,
and please note that topics change over time and in response to student and faculty
interests. Finally, students should expect to prepare and present in groups to colleagues in
classes on selected issues of business responsibility.

MANAGEMENT
Students are required to complete one of the Management courses below:

 MGMT 6110: Managing the Established Enterprise                                     1.0CU
 MGMT 6120: Managing the Emerging Enterprise                                        1.0CU


MGMT 6110 – Managing the Established Enterprise (1.0CU)
The management of large, established enterprises creates a range of multi-facet
challenges for the general manager. A general manager needs to understand the internal
workings of a ﬁrm, how to assess and create a strategy, and how to take into account
increasing globalization. While these issues are distinct, they are very much intertwined. As
a result, this course will provide you with an integrated view of these challenges and show
you that eCective management of an established enterprise requires a combination of
insights drawn from economics, sociology, psychology and political economy.

MGMT 6120 – Managing the Emerging Enterprise (1.0CU)
Emerging enterprises, the focus in this course, are small, new, fast-growing organizations.
Their founders and managers face multifaceted challenges: how to assess the competitive
position of their business model and develop a strategy; how to develop the internal
organizational structure, culture, and policies for selecting and managing employees; and
how to pursue global opportunities. We cover these challenges in separate modules on
strategy, human and social capital, and global issues. The human and social capital
module covers classic management challenges of aligning interests of the individual and
the organization; managing individual psychological needs and social inﬂuences; and
developing employee capabilities that provide competitive advantage. Also covered are
unique challenges that young organizations face, i.e. building an eCective culture;
recruiting, selecting, and retaining talent; building systematic approaches to motivating
employees; coping with the stresses of rapid growth; and leveraging the beneﬁts (and
avoiding the liabilities) of the founder's powerful imprint. The strategy module covers
fundamental issues central to the competitiveness of the enterprise. Because the strategy
ﬁeld is broad, MGMT 6120 emphasizes topics and frameworks that are most relevant for
younger ﬁrms, such as innovation, disruption, managing resource constraints, and building
capabilities. The global module covers the emerging ﬁrm's decision about when (and
whether) to internationalize. This decision must address which foreign markets to enter;
the mode of entry; the sequence of moves to develop capabilities; what organizational
form to choose; where to establish HQ; and how to adapt to the unique economic and
institutional features of diCerent markets.

MARKETING
Students are required to complete one of the following Marketing courses unless they have
received a substitution by credential:

 MKTG 6120: Dynamic Marketing Strategy                                              0.5CU
 MKTG 6130: Strategic Marketing Simulation                                          0.5CU


MKTG 6120 – Dynamic Marketing Strategy (0.5CU)
The goal of this course is to develop skills in formulating and implementing marketing
strategies for brands and businesses. The course will focus on issues such as the selection
of which businesses and segments to compete in, how to allocate resources across
businesses, segments, and elements of the marketing mix, as well as other signiﬁcant
strategic issues facing today's managers in a dynamic competitive environment. A central
theme of the course is that the answer to these strategic problems varies over time
depending on the stage of the product life cycle at which marketing decisions are being
made. As such, the PLC serves as the central organizing vehicle of the course. We will
explore such issues as how to design optimal strategies for the launch of new products and
services that arise during the introductory phase, how to maximize the acceleration of
revenue during the growth phase, how to sustain and extend proﬁtability during the mature
phase, and how to manage a business during the inevitable decline phase.

MKTG 6130 – Strategic Marketing Simulation (0.5CU)
Marketing 6130 is an intensive immersion course designed to develop skills in formulating
and implementing marketing strategies for brands and businesses. The central activity will
be participation in a realistic integrative product management simulation named SABRE. In
SABRE, students will form management teams that oversee all critical aspects of modern
product management: the design and marketing of new products, advertising budgeting
and design, sales force sizing and allocation, and production planning. As in the real world,
teams will compete for proﬁtability, and the success that each team has in achieving this
goal will be a major driver of the class assessment. The SABRE simulation is used to convey
the two foci of learning in the course: the changing nature of strategic problems and their
optimal solutions as industries progress through the product life cycle, and exposure to the
latest analytic tools for solving these problems. Speciﬁcally, SABRE management teams
will receive training in both how to make optimal use of marketing research information to
reduce uncertainty in product design and positioning, as well as decision support models
to guide resource allocation.

 OPERATIONS, INFORMATION AND DECISIONS
 Students are required to complete 1CU of the following Operations courses:

OIDD 6110: Quality and Productivity                                               0.5CU
OIDD 6120: Business Analytics                                                     0.5CU
OIDD 6130: Online Business Models and the Information-Based Firm                  0.5CU
OIDD 6140: Innovation                                                             0.5CU
OIDD 6150: Operations Strategy                                                    0.5CU
OIDD 6620: Enabling Technologies                                              0.5CU or 1.0CU
OIDD 6900: Managerial Decision Making                                             0.5CU


 OIDD6110 – Quality and Productivity (0.5CU)
 Matching supply with demand is an enormous challenge for ﬁrms: excess supply is too
 costly, inadequate supply irritates customers. In the course, we will explore how ﬁrms can
 better organize their operations so that they more eCectively align their supply with the
 demand for their products and services. Throughout the course, we illustrate mathematical
 analysis applied to real operational challenges - we seek rigor and relevance. Our aim is to
 provide both tactical knowledge and high-level insights needed by general managers and
 management consultants. We will demonstrate that companies can use (and have used)
 the principles from this course to signiﬁcantly enhance their competitiveness.

 OIDD 6120 – Business Analytics (0.5CU)
 This is a course on business analytics tools and their application to management
 problems. Its main topics are optimization, decision making under uncertainty, and
 simulation. The emphasis is on business analytics tools that are widely used in diverse
 industries and functional areas, including operations, ﬁnance, accounting, and marketing.
 The course has a twofold purpose. First, it seeks to introduce you to simple models and
 ideas that provide useful (and often surprising) qualitative insights about a large spectrum
 of managerial problems. Second, it aims to give you a feeling for the kinds of problems that
 can be tackled quantitatively, the methods and software available for doing so, and some
 of the issues involved in gathering the relevant data.

 OIDD 6130 – Online Business Models and the Information-Based
 Firm (0.5CU)
 This course is devoted to the study of the strategic use of information and the related role
 of information technology. It is designed for students who want to manage and compete in
 technology-intensive businesses. Heavy emphasis is placed on applying information
 economics principles and theoretical rigor to analyze businesses in information-intensive




                                                                                                14
                                                                                  FLEX CORE

industries using both qualitative and quantitative techniques. We will study information-
based industries like digital media, social networks, ﬁnancial services, and online retail as
well as traditional businesses that are being changed by new digital capabilities. There are
four broad themes for the course: the economics of information goods and services,
information and consumer behavior, markets and market design, and network economics.
Each day we will discuss a core topic in one or more of these themes, with an emphasis on
bridging theoretical ideas to real world applications. Application topics might include
applying artiﬁcial intelligence, platform economics, and cryptocurrencies. Technology
skills are not required, although a background in information technology management,
strategic management, data science, or managerial economics is helpful.

OIDD 6140 – Innovation (0.5CU)
The course is ﬁrst and foremost an intensive, integrative, project course in which student
teams create one or more real businesses. This course has launched some businesses
now run by alumni. The project experience is an exciting context in which to learn key tools
and fundamentals useful in innovation, problem solving, and design. Examples of these
tools and fundamentals are: problem deﬁnition, identiﬁcation of opportunities, generating
alternatives, selecting among alternatives, principles of data graphics, and managing
innovation pipelines. The course requires a commitment of at least 10 hours of work
outside of class and comfort working on unstructured, interdisciplinary problems.
Students with a strong interest in innovation and entrepreneurship are particularly
encouraged to enroll.

OIDD 6150 – Operations Strategy (0.5CU)
Operations strategy is about organizing people and resources to gain a competitive
advantage in the delivery of products (both goods and services) to customers. This course
approaches this challenge primarily from two perspectives: 1) how should a ﬁrm design
their products so that they can be proﬁtably oCered; 2) how can a ﬁrm best organize and
acquire resources to deliver its portfolio of products to customers. To be able to make
intelligent decisions regarding these high-level choices, this course also provides a
foundation of analytical methods. These methods give students a conceptual framework
for understanding the linkage between how a ﬁrm manages its supply and how well that
supply matches the ﬁrm's resulting demand. Speciﬁc course topics include designing
service systems, managing inventory and product variety, capacity planning, approaches
to sourcing and supplier management, constructing global supply chains, managing
sustainability initiatives, and revenue management. This course emphasizes both
quantitative tools and qualitative frameworks.

OIDD 6620 – Enabling Technologies (0.5CU or 1.0CU)
This course is about understanding emerging technology enablers with a goal of
stimulating thinking on new applications for commerce. The class is self-contained (mainly
lecture-based) and will culminate in a class-driven identiﬁcation of novel businesses that




                                                                                                15
                                                                              FLEX CORE

exploit these enablers. No prerequisite or technical background is assumed. Students with
little prior technical background can use the course to become more technologically
informed. Those with moderate to advanced technical background may ﬁnd the course a
useful survey of emerging technologies. The course is recommended for students
interested in careers in consulting, investment banking and venture capital in the tech
sector.

OIDD 6900 – Managerial Decision Making (1.0CU)
Over the last 50 years, psychologists and economists have joined forces to study how
people process information and actually make decisions, rather than how they would make
decisions if they were fully rational and selﬁsh. This research program (dubbed behavioral
economics) has provided an understanding of how people’s decisions deviate from
“optimal” choices as well as the consequences of such deviations. This course is devoted
to understanding the nature, causes and implications of these limitations. The ﬁrst two
thirds of the course will focus on when individuals make decisions that deviate from the
predictions of economics, and the ﬁnal third of the course will focus on implications of
these systematic decision biases for managers and policy makers.
