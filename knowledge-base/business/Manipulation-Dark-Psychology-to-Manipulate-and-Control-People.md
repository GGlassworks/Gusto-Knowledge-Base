Introduction
This book explores the theory of manipulation by breaking down manipulation
into its component parts, forming useful, objective definitions and offering
practical advice for manipulating others.
The first part of the book is primarily concerned with introducing ideas and
explaining them, in order to form a grounding for the practical sections of the
book later on. It is important to remember that much of the information is
general, because effective manipulation requires actions which are situation
specific. Rather than telling you what to do, this book will give you the ability to
form effective manipulation strategies, whatever your goals and situation.
Examples are included to provide context to some of the general advice in the
book, illustrating how to apply the knowledge in a practical sense.
In addition, the book covers areas relevant to forming and executing effective
manipulation strategies, including analysis, cold reading and body language. The
book does not define manipulation as something inherently bad, despite its
negative connotations. Ethical issues surrounding manipulation are addressed in
a dedicated chapter.
After reading the book, you can expect to have greater insight into your own
actions and the actions of others. You will have a strong grounding in the
mechanics of manipulation, allowing you to make your own decisions about
manipulating others, and recognize when others are manipulating you.
Unlike many charlatans, who claim to have shortcuts to recognize when people
are lying, and make others bend to your every command, this book is honest
about its limitations and recommends caution where it is sensible.
What Is Manipulation?
It of primary importance to establish a clear definition of manipulation for the
purposes of this book. Without understanding exactly what constitutes
manipulation, there will be a great deal of difficulty in separating instances of
manipulation and other forms of influence.
While you probably have your own idea of what counts as manipulation, it is
important that you adopt the book’s definition, in order to make sense of the
practical advice in later chapters.
Basic Ideas
In a broad sense, manipulation is the effort to affect the behavior or perception
of others. Most definitions extend that to include “via the use of abusive,
deceptive or otherwise exploitative means” or something similar, as a means of
differentiating between manipulation and other influencing behaviors, such as
persuasion.
That raises even more questions, such as what constitutes “exploitative”.
Deception is relatively easy to define as a willful concealment or alteration of
the truth. But does deception really preclude persuasion?
At a job interview, you probably won’t mention the times you came in late to
work at your previous job due to hangovers; is that manipulation? You could
argue that anyone hiring for a job is already operating on the understanding that
people are likely to highlight their positive traits, and draw attention away from
the negatives. In that sense, it isn’t necessarily dishonest to omit certain
information in that situation. So expectation can also play a part in determining
the ethics of manipulation and where the line is drawn between manipulation and
other forms of influence.
Putting ethics aside for now, there is another word, in that broad definition,
worthy of attention. Defining manipulation as an “effort” suggests that
manipulation is still manipulation regardless of success or failure – the act of
manipulation is defined as the attempt. Ironically, those least successful at
manipulating others, who are most frequently discovered, are more likely to gain
a reputation as manipulative than those who succeed.
You can probably point to someone in your orbit, a relative or co-worker
perhaps, who you consider to be manipulative. Yet, consider how others view
them. Are they well known as a manipulator? Does this impact their success?
The answer to this, too, may be complicated. If someone is considered by their
peers at work to be manipulative and yet holds sway over the boss, they might
still be judged successful. When thinking about manipulating others, it’s
important to define clear goals. This will allow you to make rational, objective
decisions, which is key to success.
At this point, there are too many questions and too few answers. The remainder
of this chapter will tie up some loose ends, and establish a definition that will
give bearing for the rest of the book.
Manipulation Vs Influence
The modern world has adopted the term influencer for people with a large social
media following, capable of influencing others with their content. It doesn’t take
a particularly critical mind to recognize the source of this term as advertising. As
consumer behavior evolves, advertisers have taken note and increasingly look to
harness the power of influencers to gain attention for products. This is done
variously through paid or unpaid sponsorships, promotional deals and
agreements.
In some cases, influencers disclose these agreements while, in others, they don’t.
Ethical questions are again raised, particularly if an influencer is ostensibly just a
happy consumer but secretly on the payroll of the company which sells the
product.
Surely this whole moral quandary could have been avoided, if advertisers instead
coined the term manipulator! Yet it’s hardly surprising that they didn’t. What
this highlights is that, although people expect advertisers to be manipulative, it is
still unthinkable that they would admit to it. Instagram stars happily list
themselves as influencer on their profile page with seemingly no negative
connotations.
But the goals of many influencers, especially those who work with advertisers,
are fundamentally manipulative. It’s not even a grey-area issue. Influencers aim
to shift products to their followers in order to make money. It is not possible to
know if everyone they influence would benefit from the product, nor is it
possible to know their financial situation or any specific circumstances. In this
case, the influencer is putting their own interests first.
Manipulation does not necessarily include an attempt to harm others. However,
it must, to some degree, place one’s own goals and interests first. This is part of
the puzzle.
Additionally, it is safest and most logical to refer to influence as a parent term of
manipulation; one which includes manipulation and other methods of influence,
such as inspiration and emulation.
Manipulation Vs Persuasion
These terms might seem diametrically opposed, with persuasion acting as the
“honest” form of manipulation, where the actor is up front about their goals and
opinions. However, for the purposes of this book, it will be more useful to
consider persuasion as a tier below manipulation.
Persuasion, then, becomes a method of manipulation, which is a form of
influence. Persuasion also happens to be one of the less effective methods of
manipulation. How often have you been in a debate with someone else, only for
them to hold up their hands and say “I concede, you are absolutely right”? It is
probably possible for you to count these instances on one hand.
It may be easy to persuade someone that smoking is unhealthy but is it easy to
persuade them to quit? If it were so, governments wouldn’t see the need or
benefit in placing heavy taxes on tobacco products in order to discourage use.
According to this book’s definition, the government is trying to manipulate the
consumption of tobacco and using a range of methods, including persuasion, to
achieve that end.
So what about other forms of influence? And other methods of manipulation?
Well, manipulation needs to have intent and it ought to have some form of goal –
even if that goal is just to create anarchy. A great filmmaker may influence the
work of many others but it is clearly distinct from manipulation. The filmmaker
doesn’t set out to influence others (although they may), rather they achieve
influence through the reaction of others to their work, resulting in inspiration and
even emulation.
Persuasion, likewise, is not the only method of manipulation one could employ.
An easy alternative is lying, a form of deception. To lie and to be believed will
inevitably change the perception of those who believe the lie. As has already
been established, it is still manipulation whether it is successful or not.
Persuasion, like influence, doesn’t suffer from quite the same image problem as
manipulation. In fact it’s seen as a positive thing to be able to make a
“persuasive argument.” Although it does have a sinister tinge; the phrase “I can
be very persuasive” implies some exertion of power over another party –
possibly even an abuse. Also, when employers refer to the soft skill of
“persuasion,” it is correct to understand this as a euphemism for manipulation.
At least in part.
Defining Manipulation
Concluding this chapter, it is now possible to create a suitable and helpful
definition of manipulation for the purposes of this book.
Manipulation is a form of intentional influence, characterized as an
attempt, by a person or party (the manipulator), to change the behavior of
another person or party (the target), typically with a view to achieving a
goal in the manipulator’s interests.
There is no nefarious implication, nor is it specified whether or not the
manipulator is acting in, against, or with no regard for the interests of the target.
All are possible. This achieves a definition of manipulation which is not
constrained by subjective ethical ideas. Although that doesn’t mean you should
abandon your morals as well!
This definition is useful because it is objective and clear. Also, it is helpful
because, in this book, you will learn techniques for manipulation that will help
you to achieve your goals. In that respect, it would be a mistake to exclude
persuasion, which absolutely can play an important role in manipulation and is
inextricable from the advice in this book.
Two problems remain, however. The first relates to “intended influence.” Intent
is difficult because it implies responsibility. In actual fact, everyone manipulates
everyone around them all the time, even from a young age. It would be wrong to
exclude a child’s temper tantrum from the umbrella of manipulation, just
because they aren’t old enough to rationalize their behavior. The same applies to
adult temper tantrums, for that matter. Intent, therefore, does not imply
conscious behavior – it can also be instinctive. This also allows for the, very
real, presence of “naturally manipulative” persons.
The second problem is the disappointingly vague ending: “typically to achieve a
goal in the manipulator’s interests.” Not only is it problematic to define “the
manipulator’s interests,” there is a catch-all ambiguity in the inclusion of
“typically.” This part serves only to create a normalized idea of manipulation for
the purposes of this book and absolutely wouldn’t suit a more general definition.
After all, how can someone perfectly know their own interests? It is of course
possible to successfully manipulate someone, and for the result to still be one’s
own demise.
The latter problem is addressed during the course of the book, at points where it
happens to be relevant. Despite its flaws, this definition of manipulation is
sufficient for the practical parts of the book.
Examples of Manipulation
With the definition established, it is now of use to recognize some examples of
manipulation. Some of these are common in everyday life, while others relate to
unique or spectacular events. While this book relates primarily to personal
manipulation, there is little theoretical difference between manipulation on an
individual level and on a grand scale. The same principles almost always apply
but the practicalities of manipulation methods, such as deception, can be more
complex between, say, warring nations.
Advertising
Even the most innocuous advertising is trying to inform you, with a view to
changing behavior or perception. It is, by this book’s definition, manipulation.
Some advertising may have positive intentions, such as adverts to raise money
for charities (although the ethical practices of charities can and have also been
drawn into question on many occasions) or a positive impact, such as an advert
that informs you of genuine savings or advantages offered by a product or
supplier.
On the more insidious end of the scale, you have advertising methods such as
influencers, who attempt to affect your purchasing decisions by encouraging
emulation of their lifestyle. There are also online adverts which are often
indistinguishable from other content – even the most ethical websites normally
only flag up paid ads with a small “sponsored” tag; other times, adverts may be
completely undisclosed.
Advertising can manipulate by highlighting the positive features of a product or
service. It is difficult to trust adverts as an accurate source of information
because they are inherently biased. Techniques such as subliminal advertising
sometimes go to extremes to drive messages about a product into your
subconscious. You may have seen famous examples of sexual figures or
messages woven into cocktail glasses to advertise alcohol, but that’s just the tip
of the ice—cube.
Military Strategy
History offers countless examples of military foes attempting to manipulate one
another. Like in advertising, this manipulation is completely expected. If you
believe in the cause for which you are fighting, it is also morally justifiable to
manipulate your enemy in any way.
The Battle of Hastings (1066 AD), saw the Norman William the Conqueror
(spoiler alert) invade England with his army, comprised of many mounted
knights. He was met by Harold Godwinson, the recently coronated King of
England at Hastings, near the English Channel. According to legend, Harold
took position atop a hill and waited for the approaching invaders. William,
seeing the disadvantage of fighting uphill, ordered a retreat, with the intention of
luring the defenders into a pursuit. The plan was a success. Sensing victory,
Harold pursued William’s army down the hill and, in the process, sacrificed their
advantageous position. The rest, they say, is history: William’s mounted knights
were able to overwhelm the largely infantry-based army of Harold and his
victory thwarted his only significant opposition in England.
Although the accuracy of this account has been called into question, the lesson
of the legend prevails: manipulate your enemy and you will achieve victory.
You can also find many instances of wars fought as characterizations of military
leaders. Rommel, a German WWII general, was famed for his tactical brilliance
in North African campaigns against allied forces, earning his nickname: “the
Desert Fox.” Techniques to obstruct or distort the information received, by a
military adversary, follow the same principles as those you would use for
another person.
It is also possible to draw parallels to games such as chess and real-time strategy
video games, where successful strategies often revolve around deceiving your
opponents with regards to your own intentions.
The Professional World
If you work in a company, it’s likely that you’ve been exposed to ambitious
individuals whose goal is to climb the corporate ladder. Again, in the
professional world, a certain level of manipulation is to be expected. This is one
of the reasons that working together with personal friends can create
complications, as a conflict exists in managing these two different kinds of
relationships – competitive and supportive.
In professional life, you are presented with a range of different relationship
paradigms. Your relationship to fellow team members will vary to that with your
boss, or to those who work under you. Modern corporate structures tend to be
flatter and a managerial approach that relies purely on authority is less viable
than it used to be. It’s up to managers and team-leaders to “motivate” their
employees. Well done if you immediately identified motivation as another form
of manipulation.
This book concerns itself specifically with professional and personal
relationships, so expect some relevant examples for manipulation in the
workplace.
Personal Relationships
This is inevitably the most controversial arena for manipulation, yet ironically it
is probably the most natural. From the moment you’re born, you come
preprogrammed with the ability to cry – a simple and effective way to
communicate immediate needs, in order to receive care and attention.
Manipulation happens in family relationships as well as in friendships and
romantic relationships.
The reason for controversy is rooted in the idea that contriving to manipulate
others, in personal relationships, is something unnatural and rooted in a need for
control. Although, once again, there is some grey area. It’s quite normal for a
parent to manipulate a child’s behavior by using a system of incentives and
punishments. This is normally considered to be part of a child’s education and a
healthy part of development, preparing a child for adulthood.
Manipulation in a romantic relationship, however, is viewed as something less
than chivalrous. It conjures up the idea of an individual lying and emotionally
blackmailing their partner in order disguise behavior or trap someone in a
relationship. On the other side of the coin, it’s plausible that people would praise
manipulation, including deceit, if the end goal was to help a partner quit
smoking or lose weight.
These ethical questions are addressed later in the book. For now, it’s just useful
to consider the different scenarios where manipulation may be present. Try
examining the world around you to spot examples of manipulation and
understand the mechanisms with which they operate.
Advantages of Manipulation
This chapter isn’t long. The benefits of manipulation are plainly obvious, much
like the benefits of bank robbery. Successfully manipulating others is a way to
impact the world around you and bend it to your will. That might sound sinister,
but remember it’s extremely likely that you’re already doing it to some degree.
To differentiate between what you might already be doing and what you can
learn from this book, instead interpret this chapter as the benefits of consciously,
deliberately and effectively manipulating others.
Achieve Your Goals
By successfully manipulating others, you can alter their behavior, their views
and possible even their goals to help further your own interests. It’s as simple as
that.
Effective manipulation, however, is about improving your rate of success. It
might be that everyone is manipulating the boss, to some degree, in order to get
that promotion – but only one candidate is going to get the job. Working hard is
a good place to start, and working effectively is even better. However, leaving it
to merit alone might not get you through. How can you make it so that your boss
wants to promote you, rather than anyone else? Understanding that will give you
the edge.
Likewise, it’s one thing to tell your crush you like them, but another to be the
object of their desire. Effective manipulation is about cultivating a situation
where your success is the most likely (or ideally the inevitable) result.
Help Others
If you believe in a cause, you can support it by using manipulation to further its
success. This can be anything from using a swear jar to stop a relative cursing, to
earning support for your political party.
It’s the same as achieving your own goals but you’re transplanting the interests
of someone or something else in place of your own. As stated in the definition,
manipulation is a form of influence.
Guard Yourself Against the Manipulation of Others
The more you understand about manipulation, the better equipped you’ll be to
avoid being manipulated by others. Recognizing manipulative behaviors in other
people will not only protect you against their influence, but you’ll learn more
about their goals, feeding your mind with information that you can use to
manipulate them.
It’s not hard to be aware of situations where you can expect to encounter
manipulative behavior. What’s more difficult is to always spot the ways in
which you are being manipulated.
A key part of this is understanding the goals of other parties and how they are
attempting to achieve those goals at any given moment. With this information,
not only can you recognize and capitalize on the behavior of others, you can
develop the ability to predict the future actions of your adversaries.
This requires emotional intelligence, as it is absolutely necessary to be able to
place yourself in the shoes of your target. In developing this ability, a good place
to start is by assessing your own behavior through your actions and learning to
understand your choices from an objective standpoint. Doing so will require
some practice, but later chapters will cover that in some detail.
Manipulation Fundamentals
Without further ado, it’s time to get into some of the crucial aspects of
manipulating others. Thanks to the early chapters, you should now have the
groundwork to give context to the ideas in this chapter and form a general
understanding of effective approaches to manipulation.
In the chapter Methodology, you will learn how to use these ideas in order to
form a coherent strategy that will improve your chances of successfully
manipulating others, and achieving your goals.
Goals
Your Goals
Given that you’re probably already manipulating the people around you to some
degree, and being manipulated yourself, the first significant step in achieving
effective manipulation is to understand and define your goals. Without defining
goals, it’s impossible to measure the effectiveness of your current manipulation
efforts.
That’s not to say you aren’t already manipulating with some level of
effectiveness. Some people are naturally more manipulative and some people are
natural manipulators; however, the two don’t always overlap.
Start by thinking about your actions, and your behavior around others. Consider
who you view positively at work, or in your social circle, and who you view
negatively. Consider, further, how you behave around different people and
whether it aligns perfectly to your opinion of them. There is a good chance that it
doesn’t. In fact, what you are probably already doing is working to earn the good
opinion of others who you believe to hold power and influence.
This is a very general approach that everyone takes in society. To use an obvious
example, your behavior around your boss is probably different to that of your
peers, regardless of your personal opinion of them.
You may even have a set goal, such as reaching “X” position. Otherwise, you
might just be broadly trying to impress. You might even be trying to carve out an
easy work-life for yourself, shedding responsibility and doing what you can to
obscure your low productivity. Maybe you’re acting to bring yourself closer to a
co-worker in whom you are romantically interested.
These are just ideas. At the end of each day, think about your own behavior.
What did you spend your day thinking about and trying to achieve? These are
the goals you are naturally working towards already. When you really
understand what your current motives are, you might surprise yourself.
In order to start manipulating effectively, it’s time to clearly and consciously
define your goals. If you’ve already done so, that’s great. Make sure you have
something with a clearly defined end point. Rather than just “do well at work,”
consider “earn a raise,” or, even better, “earn a salary of $X per year by
MM/DD/YY.” By not only defining a goal, but a date as well, you are giving
yourself the added motivation of avoiding failure.
With a clearly defined goal, you can start assessing your actions against your
objective. Ask yourself “will this action help me achieve X?” and you might
already be able to make smarter decisions. Don’t stop reading just yet, though!
There are some important considerations to make before you suddenly change
your behavior. Watch out for snakes in the grass…
The Goals of Others
While your own goals are the way to measure the success of your efforts, the
goals of others are key to forming a successful manipulation strategy.
The key to manipulation is using the goals of others to further your own.
This is the most all-encompassing theory of manipulation and the core of this
book’s approach to manipulation.
At times, you might hold the cards and can help someone to achieve their own
goals. This might be as an employee who possesses vital assets for your boss to
achieve success in their role. It might be the case that you are the boss and have
the power to promote people… not discounting the power you have to help those
people achieve their goals by not firing them.
Having what it takes to help other people achieve their goals gives you inherent
value to them.
Here are some examples of situations in which your goals can interact with those
of another, in order to benefit you:
               Sticking with the professional field as a reference, say that one of
               your co-workers is put in charge of a business trip to a trade
               expo. Whatever their broader career goals may be at that point, it
               is likely that part of achieving them will be to have a successful
               trade expo.
           If that person has reason to believe your assets will help them to
           achieve that success, they are likely to take you as well. Gaining that
           experience will be valuable to your career, potentially raising your
           value as an employee and putting you in greater standing for a
           promotion.
           This is a simplified example to illustrate this line of thinking. It
           seems obvious, but by breaking it down, it’s possible to make an
           evaluation of where you fit in to the goals someone else wants to
           achieve.
               It might be that your employer, whose goal is to achieve higher
               profits, plans to expand your division. They might decide to do
                this based on the success of your division or the emergence of an
                expanded market for the service you provide. The knock-on
                effect would be an increased requirement for your labor –
                suddenly you’ve gone up in value and it might be harder for your
                boss to refuse offering you a raise.
            For example, say that you work in a construction company, and a
            new technology comes into the fore, which happens to require
            specialist crane operation and you happen to be an experienced crane
            operator. In this case, your boss is probably looking to hire more
            crane operators, which takes time, potentially requires training and
            other investments on their part. It’s likely that, even giving you a
            raise, your boss would still avoid cost of hiring someone new, let
            alone the bother.
In both of these examples, you have the power to help someone achieve their
goals. This is what drives your success. There is no element of manipulation
here – it is simply an analysis of how your goals can relate to those of others.
The manipulation will come with cultivating these situations, by working to
ensure the actions others take, to achieve their goals, align with your own.
Now, consider personal relationships. Imagine that you are romantically
interested in someone else. Your ultimate goal might be to enter into a
relationship with that person. All of a sudden, things get extremely complicated.
Not only is it unclear what a person might want from a relationship to you, it
might be unclear even to themselves. Many people have not considered what
forms the basis of their attraction to others. So if you want to effectively
manipulate the situation to result in the start of your relationship together, it may
be necessary for you to understand that person better than they understand
themselves.
For now, just hold onto the idea as a thinking point.
Actions
Having mentioned actions frequently already, it is appropriate to dedicate a
paragraph to them. Actions are the things people do. The actions of a person
define their behavior. Repeated actions can be recognized in identifying
behavioral patterns. An action can be anything from a facial expression, or
involuntary body movement, to speech and decisions as well as acts of violence
or sabotage.
Tools
Understanding goals provides the necessary information for effectively
manipulating others. Tools, on the other hand, are the raw materials you have at
your disposal for affecting those goals, or the actions taken by others to achieve
them.
In this book, persuasion was previously referred to as a method. However, tool
more accurately describes the way in which these following concepts behave –
tools to effectively manipulate.
Power
In the last section, Goals, you read some examples relating to the workplace,
specifically regarding situations in which you might be able to help someone
else achieve their goals. This translates to power.
Power is the ability to help other people succeed.
This is an interesting definition because it appears to subvert the normal idea of
power as an ability to exert force over others. However, breaking it down, the
two are closely related. Having the ability to exert force over others can mean
not harming them, not invading their country, not throwing them in jail, not
creating laws which negatively impact them; these are all forms of power – the
power to help other people succeed is much the same as the power to make other
people fail, left unexercised.
These are just positive and negative perspectives of the same thing. The
difference is often negligible.
What can you provide people that will help other people achieve their goals?
The most obvious thing is extraordinary abilities. Talent is valuable in every
aspect of life, from sports competitions, to business, to raising children. If you
have talents that other people can use, that’s a powerful thing.
Another form of power is authority. The boss gets to decide who is promoted
and who is fired. A police officer can arrest you or let you off with a warning,
thanks to their legally sanctioned authority. A judge may decide your sentence,
based on certain constraints, and their opinion of your nature.
However, there’s a problem: you might have the same, or greater, talents as
another person. And yet, they may be more successful than you, held in higher
regard and enjoy greater benefits.
The other aspect to power is reputation. This relates to the belief, held by others,
in your power. It’s reputation that is often key to manipulation. The judgment of
others regarding your ability, and your authority.
Persuasion
One previously mentioned tool is persuasion. Having examined persuasion in
relation to manipulation, and established it as a tool within the umbrella of
manipulation, it is now worth making a comprehensive definition of persuasion
and examining its use.
Persuasion is the effort to convince another person to change their actions.
The problem with persuasion alone is that, so often, it is obvious to the person
that you have an incentive to convince them. They believe that you stand to gain
from the persuasion, which is unhelpful when trying to manipulate a friendly or
neutral party, and devastating when trying to manipulate a rival.
Persuasion is most useful when you can reveal new information to change the
perception of others. If someone is likely to change their course based on new
information or new understandings of information, which you can provide,
persuasion then has a chance of success. This means providing information
which will affect either the goals of another party, or the actions they will take to
achieve them.
The only other scenario is when another party believes that your goals somehow
have a positive relationship with their own. In this case, they may trust your
judgment, and your intentions, and take up your cause.
This is great when you genuinely have new information, or the trust of another
party. But on many occasions, you won’t. On those occasions, persuasion is only
going to be effective when combined with other tools, such as deception. That
means attempting to persuade someone based on a lie or partial truth. Once
again, you are revealing new information or leading someone to believe your
goals align with theirs, but in truth you are fabricating or hiding elements.
Deception
This is the third tool for manipulation. It forms the core of so many approaches
to manipulation and interacts with both power and persuasion significantly.
Deception is the control of information.
Start thinking objectively and it becomes possible to imagine people as
machines. The machines are designed to achieve goals, and will do so by
reacting to inputs (information) and creating outputs (actions). If you control the
inputs, by controlling that information, you can deceive. With that deception,
you can change the outputs, resulting in different actions.
The reason deception takes a central role in manipulation is that it is important
for parties you manipulate to believe their actions are furthering their own
interests. Otherwise, they have no reason to take those actions. The objective of
deception is to control information in such a way that the information they
receive leads them to actions which further your interests.
Naturally, the main danger, with deception, is being discovered. For this reason,
deception is often best avoided where possible and, when used, to be carefully
controlled. An ideal deception would have minimal risk and maximum reward,
with plausible deniability if found out. There is also the risk that lies can lead to
further lies, in order to cover up the original deception; in this case, the risk
swells while the reward remains the same and what might have seemed like a
good idea at first can become a terrible decision.
Irrational Behavior
So far, in the fundamentals of manipulation, there has been an assumption based
on the idea that parties act rationally. This is, broadly, a good assumption. What
may seem like irrational behavior, to some people, is often a case of someone
having unexpected goals.
It is of little interest, to your manipulation efforts, to assess the rationality of
anyone’s goals. While the volatility (liability to change) of those goals is of
interest, the rationality of them is not. The important thing is to determine a
person’s goals via their actions and use those goals to predict, and manipulate,
their future actions.
For example, a co-worker may seemingly be slacking off at work. They might
not be doing any of the things required to achieve a promotion or make a good
impression on your boss. Is their behavior irrational? It may seem so, but only if
you assume their main goal is to advance their career. In actual fact, they may be
looking for an easy ride, or focused on pursuing a love interest in the office.
They might be more interested in their life outside of work and simply choose to
earn some respite during work hours, so they can party it up all night again. In
that sense, their actions are not irrational – they are simply geared towards
achieving another goal. Is that goal rational? It hardly matters.
Irrational behavior is a cognitive failure to perform actions which help
achieve one’s goals.
The person in the previous example might have a stated goal to become head of
sales in the next two years. However, that doesn’t mean their real goals align. If
someone is not consciously acting to achieve their goals, they can no longer be
called their goals. Therefore the behavior is still not irrational.
Irrational behavior is more like a tick of the mind. It is a mistake, based on either
a failure of human instinct or a lack of understanding. This is distinct from a lack
of information, whereby a person can still make a mistake, however it is rational
behavior based on the knowledge available to them.
A good example of irrational behavior is playing the lottery. Everyone knows
how unlikely it is that your ticket will win, but many people play anyway, for the
chance to win big. Something about human instinct encourages people to gamble
for a reward.
The same approach is used by social media apps, who have discovered that an
endlessly scrolling feed is the perfect way to tap into a twitch of human instinct.
People scroll down and down the page, revealing new posts and content, each
time gambling on whether something will be of interest or more drivel. It plays
into the same risk/reward mechanisms as the lottery, manipulating human
instinct to get more ad views, keep people using the apps for longer and increase
their revenue.
Not everyone is as vulnerable to these methods of manipulation as others. The
way rational behavior fits into this book’s approach to manipulation is as part of
observed behavior. Just because behavior is irrational, it doesn’t mean that it is
random; it can often be predicted. This makes it just as useful as rational
behavior in understanding a person or party.
The important thing is to be aware of the possibility of irrational behavior,
identify it and work it into your approach to manipulation.
Manifestations of Manipulation
Approaches to manipulation are ways of using of the above tools to affect the
actions of others. It can vary from manipulating a single person, to manipulating
a group, to manipulating an array of people within an organization in different
ways.
Once again, you’re almost certainly already doing this to an extent. Examine
some of the following approaches and consider how they might relate to your
life already.
The Carrot and the Stick
This classic, and well known, approach to manipulation is the basic idea that
good behavior is encouraged with a reward and bad behavior is discouraged with
a punishment. It’s common in families, schools, businesses, and basically all
societies.
It’s something humans do instinctively. It might even be called justice.
However, the carrot and the stick may also form part of your efforts to
proliferate your own world view or improve your comfort. If a romantic partner
cleans the bathroom and mows the lawn, you might give them a kiss and be
more inclined to cook dinner; if they spend all day watching TV in their
underwear, God protect them from your wrath.
At work, it’s normal for a boss to incentivize workers with bonuses and, of
course, there is the ever-present threat of losing your job should you prove
unsatisfactory. But what about the carrot and the stick between peers? If a co-
worker’s actions somehow enhance your work or make it easier, isn’t it natural
to mention that and attempt to reinforce the behavior? What about if they create
an extra problem for you, that you feel could have been avoided? That’s likely to
affect your relationship. You might give them the cold shoulder.
So it’s something present in all relationships. However, learning to manipulate
people, you might find that your actions don’t always have the desired effect.
If you thank Jeff, because his work helped you out, the next time he’s in a pinch,
don’t be surprised if he neglects to go the extra mile.
Imagine that Jeff was short on time and needed to decide between helping you
out and helping Bill out, who gave him the cold shoulder last time Jeff failed to
help him. Assuming that all is equal: the work for both you and Bill was the
same and Jeff was under no additional obligation to complete either; that person
has made a calculated decision: rather than disappointing someone else and
receiving “the stick,” they’ll assign more time to their needs and forgo your
“carrot.”
What’s just happened is you’ve unsuccessfully manipulated the situation. The
attempt is there, by thanking Jeff, but you failed to get a result.
Breaking this down:
                Your power, or ability to help that person, was judged as less
                than the power of a third party to hinder them.
                Your persuasion failed because you didn’t provide information
                that convinced that person of your power.
                The lack of deception in your approach resulted in more work for
                you.
There are a few possibilities. It is possible that Jeff simply responds more to the
stick than the carrot. Despite the fact that he is obligated to complete the work
for neither you nor Bill, he will do so primarily to avoid conflict, rather than to
curry favor. An alternative is that he simply judged Bill as having more power
than you – that means a greater ability to help Jeff achieve his goals. Perhaps
Jeff predicts Bill has a higher career trajectory, more influence with the boss or
greater social influence in the office.
This isn’t to say that the stick works better than the carrot. You might find that
Ted prefers to be rewarded and generally doesn’t respond at all to negative
feedback. The important thing is to find out what drives people, and discover
their goals.
Emotional Manipulation
This is not wholly distinct from the carrot and the stick but much of
manipulating people involves emotional intelligence.
There are a variety of ways in which people emotionally manipulate others. All
of these, in some sense, work with the tools above to affect the actions of
another. It might seem natural to conclude that the goal of emotional
manipulation is to provoke irrational behavior – however, that’s rarely the case.
Emotional manipulation is much more likely to distort the truth, to the extent
that someone’s alters their path to achieve their goals, through a perceived
change in reality.
Examine an approach to emotional manipulation called the guilt trip. The guilt
trip involves trying to make someone feel worse about an action they have taken
(or an action they have failed to take, which amounts to the same thing i.e.
sitting around and not tidying your room is an action).
By guilt tripping someone, you are attempting to affect their emotional reaction
to their error. The return is for that person to feel indebted. You are altering their
perception of a situation, so that they will either: correct their behavior at the
next opportunity or make amends for their error.
Here is a breakdown of the mechanics:
                They are concerned about their loss of reputation. If they develop
                a reputation as someone who cannot or will not help others to
                achieve their goals, the result will be a loss of power. Solving the
                issue by making amends is a way to salvage their reputation.
                You are persuading them of the severity of their error. As
                previously mentioned, failing deception, this requires you to
                either offer genuine new information, such as a previously
                unknown negative impact of their error – perhaps a financial cost
                to yourself or another – or have enough of their trust that they
                believe your opinion of opinion of events to be valid, causing
                them to reassess their own.
                Naturally, you can use deception to fabricate the above –
                inventing a detail that changes their perspective. An example
                could be lying about an injury they caused to someone else
                unintentionally, playing up its severity. While you will be found
                out eventually, this might be an effective short term tactic to
                provoke a confession.
                The person who has committed the error is also affected by your
                power. If you have the ability to remedy the problem they have
                caused, they are likely to be submissive to your demands. Your
                power is the ability to help them achieve their goal of saving
                their reputation and naturally that increases, the greater they
                perceive their error to be.
Guilt tripping is far from the only form of emotional manipulation. It is difficult
to draw the line between ethical and unethical emotional manipulation. For
example, what constitutes guilt tripping as opposed to simply expressing
disappointment? They are essentially the same. Likewise, what is the difference
between intimidation and
Fortunately, this book is avoiding these issues for now but you’ll find more
information on the ethics of manipulation in the next chapter.
There are many terms for many different types of emotional manipulation. It is
not necessary to memorize, or even learn, all of them. By understanding the
mechanics of emotional manipulation, you can easily analyze and understand
them as they arise. Here are a few examples:
                Intimidation – Provoking fear in a target, such that they may
                alter their strategy for achieving their goals. In particular,
                intimidation that carries a threat of violence can encourage a
                target to change their course of action in ensuring their own self-
                preservation (a fairly universal goal). Acting to appease their
                intimidator is a way for the target to survive, and becomes their
                future behavior.
            Note that there is nothing irrational in the behavior of the target here.
            Emotional manipulation is not necessarily the provocation of
            irrational behavior. Bonus points if you recognized that this is hardly
            distinct from the “stick.”
                Seduction – Manipulating a target by presenting them with an
                object of desire, and withholding it until the target performs an
               action. The object may be the seducer or some other asset, like
               money. Scam emails from Nigerian princes work by seducing
               the target with the prospect of easy money.
           Sexual seduction may include provoking irrational behavior, based
           on the promise of endorphins. An alternative way of viewing this is
           as a persuasion to manipulate the goals of others, prioritizing a
           sexual encounter above everything else.
           Seduction revolves around power, as it is presenting and persuading
           the ability to offer somebody what they want. Bonus points if you
           recognized that this is hardly distinct from the “carrot.”
               Minimization – This is the effort to reduce someone’s
               perspective of an issue, or error you have caused. It may involve
               any manipulation tools to reduce the magnitude of the issue.
           It normally involves persuasion and deception, highlighting or
           fabricating facts to demonstrate the lack of importance. It can also
           involve rationalization, which is explaining the reasons for one’s
           actions in an attempt to justify them.
           Although this bears no direct relation to power, observe how
           differently people respond to this behavior from someone who has
           perceived power, compared to someone who is perceived to lack it.
               Blaming – Passing the blame for an error onto someone else is a
               way to preserve your power, by protecting your reputation, using
               either persuasion or deception.
           Note how easy it becomes to break down familiar actions, like
           blaming, using these three tools.
           As well as passing the blame, creating blame can also be a useful
           smokescreen. Blaming a victim is a way of persuading a victim that
           their reputation is under threat, in order to manipulate a vulnerable
           person.
At this point, you may also recognize that blaming is closely linked to
intimidation. There is damage or the threat of damage to someone’s reputation,
which can alter their actions by making them feel responsible or concerned that
others will hold them responsible.
Charisma
It is difficult, but not impossible, to learn charisma. However, it is still crucial to
mention charisma in this book, as it holds great power to manipulate others.
Charisma is the illusion of power. And the illusion of power is powerful.
Imagine a charismatic person. You’re probably thinking of a charismatic
speaker, who can hold an audience, and tell an anecdote. What good is
persuasion, or even deception, if nobody pays attention to you? Charisma
dictates much of what is referred to as natural magnetism.
And yet there are people in positions of great power who don’t seem to be
naturally charismatic at all. Politicians, performers and CEOs are possibly all
charismatic figures but for every great speaker, there are a dozen fumbling,
stuttering slouchers.
Charisma isn’t everything but it can get you a long way. By creating the illusion
of power, you can appear to have value to others around you. Although, deep
down, everyone knows that charisma is just an illusion, it remains powerful all
the same. Charismatic behavior coincides with the way talented, intelligent
people are expected to behave. And it’s likely there is some correlation to that.
It’s safe to broadly divide charisma into two component parts, each fairly useless
without the other:
                 Confidence – Confidence is a natural result of competence,
                 which is a natural result of ability and experience. It follows that,
                 to appear confident will give the impression that you have either,
                 or both, natural ability and experience i.e. useful traits which
                 could help others achieve their goals.
                 Wit – Wit is the ability to think quickly, on your feet. It is the
                 equivalent of a somersault for the mind. It demonstrates mental
                 agility, providing further evidence of your superior natural
                 abilities and understanding. Even better if you’re funny, too.
Imagine each of these traits without the other. Who is likely to make a greater
fool of themselves than a bragging, witless fool. Anyone who possesses
confidence, without wit, is destined to expose themselves as an idiot.
Equally useless is the silent genius. The wittiest remark in the world isn’t going
to increase anyone’s perception of your power if you haven’t got the confidence
to share it.
It’s possible to work on your charisma by improving your confidence naturally –
that means accumulating understanding and developing skills. Try also watching
charismatic people talk, watch what kind of comments they make and how they
earn positive reactions from others. You should observe that charismatic people
appear to find it easier to relate to an audience – a sign of emotional intelligence.
Later chapters in this book cover analyzing others and you can use those skills to
develop your charisma.
Charisma is not necessary for manipulation, but it offers a shortcut to power.
Ethical Considerations
You may wish to skip this chapter…
A joke, of course.
This book has already established a broad definition of manipulation, for
practical reasons, which allows for a range of manipulative behaviors and does
not include immoral behavior as a prerequisite. This chapter is a necessary
exploration of ethics within the broad definition of manipulation provided.
There is a lot of grey area here. Ultimately, deciding what is right and wrong is
up to each individual. This may vary depending on cultural values, laws,
religious beliefs and a learned moral compass. What this chapter establishes is
an understanding of the impact of manipulative behavior, in an effort to allow
any readers to make informed judgments about their actions.
Deception
Reading this book, so far, you may already have run into examples of
manipulation that you believe to be morally wrong. Congratulations on having a
moral compass!
One example of a difficult area, ethically, is deception. For some, all forms of
lying are wrong. This includes white lies and partial truths. If you are one of
those people, you can still use the advice in this book but it’s going to change the
way you approach manipulation. Specifically, it your approach will avoid the
use of deception and focus, instead, on power and persuasion.
For everyone else, you might need to decide how much and with what forms of
deception you feel comfortable.
First, consider the issues with deception. Deceiving others can lead others into
actions which act either against or without advancing their own interests. A side
effect of manipulating them into acting in your own. Deceiving others could also
be of benefit to them, tricking them into actions that will improve their health or
career in the long term, but which they were not capable of doing themselves.
Telling a child that their favorite super hero enjoys vegetables is an example of
this. The deceit is intended to improve the child’s diet, which could benefit their
long-term health.
Deception can also have unintended consequences. In most cases, telling such a
lie to a child is unlikely to end in disaster, but isn’t it feasible that a child could
discover the ruse, and develop distrust towards the deceiver. This could harm
them by hardening their susceptibility to future manipulation in their interests or
it could encourage lying tendencies in the child. There is no knowing, for
certain, the ultimate impact of a given action.
Consider, also, the situation where deception takes place. It’s perhaps expected
behavior to try and completely deceive your counterpart, regarding your
intentions, in a game of chess or checkers, a war or even in contract negotiation.
However, many people would consider it immoral to hold even the smallest
untruth from a future spouse.
You might even take the stance that deception, and any other behavior, is only a
crime if you get caught. It’s a potentially cynical world view but there’s an
argument to say that it’s a dog-eat-dog world and if you’re not willing to be
ruthless, someone else is going to do the same to you.
It’s not the place of this book to decide where you draw your lines in the sand.
However, some advice would be to establish some ethical boundaries, such as
“no lies that I have reason to believe will cause harm to another.” You might
find this too stringent or too lenient, so define your own boundaries and if the
moment arises where you recognize a chance to break that boundary, for your
own potential gain, at least you will have the opportunity to confront your own
morality, whether you decide to go ahead or not.
Abuse
With the reminder that this book is not telling you how to align your moral
compass, it is necessary, still, to mention that most people consider abuse to be a
bad thing. The issue is how to define abuse.
You have almost certainly heard the phrase “abuse of power.” Consider
something that most people would place at the worst end of the spectrum, such
as the sexual abuse of mentally handicapped minors. It is abuse on multiple
levels, because the minor has a number of vulnerabilities. Significantly, parents
and guardians of these individuals are in a position of trust, to protect these
individuals. They have little defense against, and lack the judgment to
understand the ways in which sexual abuse can impact their psychology. It’s an
awful, sobering thought to establish the extreme end of the abuse spectrum.
At the other end of the spectrum, there may be more nuanced or controversial
examples of what some people call abuse, such as ordering an extra portion of
fries when charging a meal to the company account. It’s an unnecessary
indulgence which allows the “abuser” to benefit excessively from the trust they
have been given.
Taking this even further, it’s possible to draw into question the nature of
business relationships. You might consider the idea of someone “sleeping their
way to the top” to be dismissive. However, how is it possible to reconcile
personal relationships where one person clearly has power over the other; for
example a boss and an employee, with ideas of the abuse of power? Are these
relationships possible without elements of abuse?
A person may naturally be drawn to their boss due to the power they hold, as has
been established. At the same time, it may be impossible for a boss to enter into
a non-abusive relationship, given the inherent vulnerability of their employee.
Perhaps it is completely possible to separate work and pleasure but these
situations are sticky, to say the least.
More pertinent to the times, it is possible to draw comparisons to the role of a
casting director for Hollywood movies. Many people have said that it is
inherently wrong for someone who has power over another, i.e. they can help
their progress towards achieving their goals, to enter into a romantic
relationship. Isn’t it the case that, in some of these instances, aspiring actors are
throwing themselves at people in positions of power? The implication, then, is
that power brings responsibility. Certainly, that carries an element of truth in the
eyes of many people and much of the media.
Once again, you will need to decide what constitutes abuse in your eyes. This
may be defined by the potential victims of your actions, in which case you might
not view a large corporation as a particularly tragic casualty, and order that extra
basket of fries. Additional food for thought would be to consider what makes a
person “vulnerable” and whether or not it is truly possible to decide that a person
is “not vulnerable.” If you successfully manipulate another person then, surely,
to some degree, they are vulnerable – if only to your cunning.
Honor
Navigating all of these ethical issues may, to some degree, force you to rely on a
code of honor. This might be dictated by a culture, or a creed. It may be created
by yourself or your peers. It may even be part of a commitment made to uphold
a certain level of integrity – as is common among reputable media outlets.
This can help you to make ethical decisions, by placing boundaries for you.
However, it’s rare that, when push comes to shove, a code of honor will actually
stop you from taking an action outside of its bounds. That is up you alone.
The Ends Vs The Means
One alternative to establishing clear ethical boundaries is to judge each case
completely on its merits. In this instance, there is more flexibility. In particular,
you may decide that any action can be justified, if the result is positive enough to
outweigh the means of achieving it.
There is a further issue, which even the most flexible moral gymnasts ought to
consider. Even if the ends justify the means, could those ends be achieved with
less wrongdoing?
Once again, it is not the place of the book to enforce a specific moral code.
However, even if your approach to ethics, in manipulation, is flexible, would
you lose anything by defining boundaries anyway? At least in that case, you can
recognize when you cross those boundaries, and it gives you a prompt to address
and justify your reasons for doing so.
Intent and Unscrupulousness
This book has already partly addressed the issue of intent in manipulation.
Consider the child who screams; young children make a lot of decisions based
on emotion and instinct. The intent may not be to manipulate, but the
manipulation is still present.
If you have spent time around children, you may know that, when a child hurts
themselves, there is a pause before their reaction. In many cases, they will look
to their parent. If the parent’s reaction is shock, they may become unsettled and
start to cry; if the parent’s reaction is to remain calm, often the child will remain
calm themselves.
They are learning to navigate the world and their influence within it. It is
difficult to assign blame to the child for manipulative behavior, even when you
would find such behavior to be unimpressive or undesirable in an adult.
On the subject of adults, you may also differentiate between unscrupulousness
(willful disregard for morals or laws that stand in the way of one’s goals) and a
complete lack of knowledge of those boundaries. Although both are potentially
ethical breaches, the latter indicates a lack of responsibility, while the former is
an extreme form of egoism – total self-interest.
In practice, this shouldn’t be a choice you’re able to make. Effective
manipulation should involve an analysis of your actions and, at the very least, a
reasonable estimate of their results. That means you’ll already have the inform
Additionally making moral decisions, based on information and consideration,
will allow you to rest in the knowledge that you took responsibility for your
decision and actively understood the consequences. It could prevent you from
making a decision you live to regret.
The Law
Despite the non-committal nature of this chapter, there is one aspect against
which this book advises you completely. That is breaking the law. Under no
circumstances is it recommended that you break the law and, if you suspect that
you are engaging in criminal activity, including fraud or another form of illegal
deception-based manipulation, you are advised to investigate the law thoroughly
and avoid any wrongdoing.
Ending up in jail is almost certainly not a way to achieve your goals and the best
way to avoid jail is to not break the law.
Methodology
This chapter is where things get really practical. In this chapter, you will learn to
apply the ideas established in previous chapters and create an effective strategy
for manipulation.
The core of developing an effective manipulation strategy revolves around
influencing others to perform actions which further your goals.
Step 1 – Define Your Goal(s)
This is the focus of your manipulation strategy. Without this, you run the risk of
manipulating people aimlessly. While diversion can be part of an effective
manipulation strategy, it should be done deliberately, rather than at random.
One important consideration, regarding your goals, is to determine if they are
something you really want to achieve. It’s no good saying that your goal is to
rule the world, if you aren’t willing to put in the effort – who needs that kind of
pressure, anyway?
It’s also better to define goals, to which there is already a clear path. You may
have larger goals, such as becoming the CEO of a Fortune 500 company –
however unless you already have a clear idea of your path to that goal, it’s
probably better to start smaller. Take that goal, and break it down. The first thing
you might need is managerial experience.
Give yourself a goal of reaching a managerial position in your company, and
have at least 50 people to you, either directly or via the chain of command.
Break that down even further, if you need to, and set your first goal as becoming
the leader of your team.
Career success isn’t the only type of goal this methodology works for. You
might set a goal to carve a niche at work which gives you more free time and
allows you to work with less stress. You might set a goal to find a loving spouse.
The goal itself doesn’t matter, as long as you really want it.
Don’t forget to set a date on your goal as well. It doesn’t matter how you arrive
at your estimate – even if you make simple guess – you can always revise it later
based on improved information. What a date gives you is a restraint,
encouraging you to think creatively in order to accelerate your plans.
Now take a note of all your goals, long-term and short-term, big and small, and
order them in terms of immediacy.
Remind yourself of your goals every single day.
In doing so, you are focusing your brain on a task. Think of a time when
achieved highly at work, school or college. Think about what it took to achieve
something that made you proud. Was it working a moderate amount of hours or
did it involve going the extra mile? Were you thinking about the project night
and day, running it through in your head before you went to sleep and
structuring it in your mind? Of course you were. That’s what made the
difference.
By focusing your brain on a task, you dedicated all your resources to achieving
highly. The more attention you dedicated to manipulation, the more you’ll be
able to accomplish and the better you’ll succeed at it.
Oh and keep your goals a secret from everyone for now, naturally.
Step 2 – Map Out Your Paths to Success
Now that you have your goals, and you’ve broken them down sufficiently, it
should be fairly easy to find a path to success. If your goal is a promotion, you’ll
need a boss to promote you. If your goal is finding a loving spouse, you’ll need
to find someone who’s going to provide that and for them to agree to marriage.
Consider alternate paths to success as well. For instance, if you want to take your
boss’ position, one path might be for them to get fired, leaving a vacancy for
you. In another situation, they could be promoted, leaving a spot open.
Map out as many paths as you can and consider them all possibilities for now.
Once you’ve done that, it’s time to establish the parties involved. Who would be
in charge of the decision-making process for your promotion? Who are your
potential rivals? How does information flow between these people?
In the case of achieving a promotion, your manipulation strategy should be to
make the people, who have the power to promote you, want to do so. You’ve
seen the movie Inception, right? Unfortunately hacking into someone’s dreams
isn’t an option.
In order to manipulate your target, you need to start understanding their goals
and behavior.
Step 3 – Gather Information
This book’s final chapters will directly address analyzing people, including
yourself. For now, it is enough to include it as part of your manipulation
strategy.
Consider the goals of the people whom you need to influence – those who will
decide whether or not you are promoted. Map out all of their actions, starting
from now and as much of their previous behavior as possible. Look for patterns
and attempt to relate each of their actions to what you perceive as their goals.
Then look for ways in which they don’t align and reassess their goals to see
pinpoint what matches.
Make an assessment of your own assets. Include hard facts, such as your time at
a company, your currently salary and your qualifications, as well as soft skills,
such as charisma and persuasion.
Profile all the parties involved, including those who have the power to promote
you, your rivals and anyone in orbit of your path to success. Include their goals
and try to record their actions, spotting patterns and connecting them to their
goals. Keep organized notes of all of this information and conceal it from
everyone.
The aim here is to give your brain as much information as possible. Once again,
imagine your brain as a machine. It has the best chance of producing the correct
outputs (actions) if it has access to the best inputs (information) and the better
you can objectively organize this information, the easier it will be to make smart
decisions, rather than subjective decisions based on instinct.
After a while, say a few days, you should start to build a picture. Take more time
if you feel like you need it. However, you don’t need to have a perfect
understanding of the situation to begin the next stage of information gathering,
which is to identify key figures among those who you are profiling and start
doing the same thing for people related to their goals. In the case of those who
have the power to promote you, this may very well be the people who have the
power to promote them.
Going a step further is going to give you an even deeper understanding of the
way that these people operate, what drives them and what is likely to impact
their decisions.
You will continue gathering information indefinitely, even as you begin
manipulating others. Make it a habit and you will get better at identifying the
goals and behavioral patterns of others faster and more accurately.
Focus on understanding where power lies and how the parties involved reach
their decisions – try to identify what provokes them to take certain actions.
Relate this back to their own goals.
Step 4 – Identify Opportunities and Threats
This is where it’s time to use your brain. You should be thinking about your
goals every day by now and developing a deeper understanding of the mechanics
of your situation.

Opportunities
Remember the goal you have set for yourself. And remember your essential aim
is to want the parties in charge of your promotion to want to promote you. What
have you learned about their goals? Take a typical scenario and say that they
want to achieve good figures – they want to improve the efficiency of your team
by increasing its profits.
Relate what you have learned about the parties in orbit of your goals back to the
paths you mapped out. Start using that knowledge to assess the likelihood
success in each case. Is it more likely that your current team leader will be fired
or promoted? Is there another opportunity for you to reach the same tier of
management elsewhere, within or even outside the company? Weigh the options
against one another.
Say you have reason to believe that your current team leader is underperforming,
and you expect them to be fired rather than promoted. In this instance, you need
to be careful of the timing. The opportunity is presenting itself and when it
arises, you need to be in pole position.
What if you’re in pole position right now? Then it’s time to get your team leader
fired as soon as possible.
Relate this to the three main tools of manipulation identified in earlier chapters:
                Power – As the candidate in pole position, you are perceived to
                have the most power to help your potential new bosses (those
                who would promote you) to achieve their goals. Likewise, you
                have also identified that your current boss, your team-leader, is
                facing the chop. This is, almost certainly, because they are
                perceived to lack the power to help their immediate superiors
                achieve their goals.
            However, they haven’t been fired yet. This might be for a number of
            reasons. Perhaps they haven’t had enough opportunity to prove
           themselves. Perhaps their superiors aren’t certain about you as a
           replacement.
               Persuasion – Forget marching up to those with the power to
               promote you and giving an epic speech about why you’re the
               perfect candidate to be the next team-leader. This isn’t a
               Hollywood movie. More to the point, the world won’t simply
               bend to your knees because you ask it to.
               Deception – What you can do is act to control the flow of
               information that reaches your boss’ superiors. The aim, in this
               instance, is to decrease their perception of your boss’ power and
               get your boss fired more quickly.
           The ways in which you could achieve this are too many to list. How
           close are you to these people, whom you need to influence? Who has
           their ear and what makes them tick? Perhaps another team-leader,
           reliant on the actions of your team, is likely to complain about your
           boss if your team fails to deliver.
           Now think: who has their ear? Possibly someone on their team.
           Possibly someone with whom you’re on talking terms. Now you
           have an opportunity, sufficiently distanced from yourself, to
           indirectly influence the people directly above your boss.
           Recapping, this refers to someone, of roughly your level, working for
           a team, roughly the same level as your own, which is dependent on
           the actions of your team. Immediately begin profiling this person,
           their goals and their actions.
           Bear in mind, this is a hypothetical example, but it gives you the idea
           of the kind of person you might stand to gain by influencing. You
           will have to analyze your own situation and form a strategy based on
           these ideas.
Note that so much of what goes into effective manipulation is deciding who to
manipulate. You are likely to be manipulating everyone at once, to some degree.
Later chapters will give you advice on how to project power using body
language and speech, giving you increased opportunities for manipulation in
general. Right now, you are forming a strategy for manipulating a specific
situation through extraordinary means.
Threats
A threat, in this instance, is any rival who has the potential to be promoted ahead
of you. An additional threat is your boss recovering their reputation (perceived
power) and getting out of the danger-zone. Consider anything, which can serve
to disrupt your path to success, as a potential threat.
Look for threats constantly and use the same principles to thwart them.
Specifically, act covertly to reduce the power of any parties which threaten to
disrupt your plans.
Step 5 – Take Action
Leaving threats aside, refocus on the current example. Here, an opportunity has
presented itself to create a deception. It may well be the case that you have a
close relationship with the person identified to start the flow information, in
which case it might be possible to conspire. If your boss is truly useless, and
your target’s team is truly dependent on an improvement in your team’s
performance, and your target aims to see that happen, you could theoretically
agree to work together, in order to perpetuate some information that will damage
the reputation of your boss.
But take a moment to look at some of the risks:
               Your collaborator is another person who can be discovered and
               the conspiracy could come back to you.
               You have revealed to another person that you wish to conspire.
               This will have an effect on their opinion of you, and your
               trustworthiness.
               Your collaborator may change their mind, in which case you will
               have sabotaged your chance to deceive them by revealing your
               goals.
               Your collaborator may alter the plan to suit their own goals and
               compromise your strategy.
With deception, you only run the risk of being found out yourself and it’s quite
possible to attempt a deception with plausible deniability.
For the purposes of this example, say you are on friendly terms with this person
and may eat lunch or take coffee with them roughly once a week. Show an active
interest by asking them questions. Mix in questions about their work with a
normal, personal interest in the person. Try to focus on pursuing lines of
conversation about which they’re willing to talk. There is a good chance this will
relate to their interests, which will relate to their goals.
Look for something in their goals which is affected by your boss’ actions. Say
their team handles delivery, while your team handles production. This is a
simple paradigm, given that the example relies on their team’s dependence on
yours. Establish the issues facing delivery and analyze elements of your boss’
behavior which could be revealed, in order for your target to arrive at the
conclusion your boss is bad news. This could be a tendency to ignore the
demands of shipping when forming a production schedule.
It’s important not to do this at a time when your target is specifically talking
about their issues. You should also reveal the information in such a way that
does not arouse suspicion. For example, when a natural opportunity arises, you
might explain the way your boss scheduled production, which clearly illustrates
the absence of shipping.
At this point, the example has reached such a degree of specificity, that it is
almost certainly impossible to directly relate to your circumstances. You will
always need to look for opportunities specific to your own situation when
engaging in manipulation. This will require you to act ingeniously, by giving
yourself as much information as possible.
You have now planted the seed of an idea in your target’s head. Your boss is
having a negative impact on your target’s professional success due to their
methods. In the eyes of your target, the goals of your boss fail to align with their
own. They must go. You have recruited someone to do your bidding, without
arousing suspicion. You have maintained a normal co-worker relationship but
achieved a deception by actively controlling the flow of information to those
who have power over your future.
If all goes according to plan, the next time your co-worker falls behind in their
work or struggles to make a deadline, they’ll know exactly who to blame. Their
team leader will relay this information to their superiors and your boss will
become even more of a problem than before, edging closer to their professional
doom.
Step 6 – Learn and Improve
Unfortunately, your plan has every chance of failure. It might be that your boss
manages production in the way they do for an important reason – one which
might be recognized by their superiors. In that case, it could even backfire. But
at least you weren’t rumbled. Take note from this manipulation attempt and use
it to inform your future efforts.
There is no way to predict the future perfectly but looking at the past is the best
way to get an approximation. Use the ideas of this methodology to develop your
own strategies and manipulate the world around you for your own ends.
Analysis
This chapter relates back to aspects of the previous chapter on the methodology
of manipulation.
By learning methods of analysis, you can develop a better understanding of the
parties which have power to help you achieve, or prevent you from achieving,
your goals. A large part of this is practice – practice observing behaviors and
then try to predict actions based on patterns you have observed. Test your
accuracy in this regard, reflect on why you failed to make an accurate prediction
and then try to remedy that in future. You will naturally improve with time.
Self-Analysis
An excellent way to begin understanding the actions, and determining the goals,
of others is to start analyzing yourself. Keep a note of your actions and observe
yourself as if you were observing a third party. Understand why you took an
action and, in particular, whether it helped or hindered your efforts to achieve
your goals.
What you are trying to do is achieve objectivity, which you can use to make
good decisions regarding your own future. Note that the terminology used here
is “good” decisions. You may already be making rational decisions but that does
not mean they are necessarily “good.”
You could be making those rational decisions based on your ill-informed
knowledge of what type of behavior works in your favor and what type of
actions work against you. By improving your knowledge, and gaining
perspective through objectivity, you can make better decisions.
Analyze, too, your instincts. Consider your instinctive reaction to a situation.
What provokes an impulse in you to become emotional? What provokes you to
make clearly irrational decisions – i.e. taking actions which offer you no value
at all, yet you take them all the same.
With self-analysis, you can recognize the occasions a decision has a negative
effect on your power. When people see you out of control, for example, they will
judge you to be a less reliable option for assistance in achieving their goals,
reducing your perceived power. The natural conclusion, and lesson to learn, is
that controlling your immediate reaction is almost always the correct choice. Do
not act until you can truly understand a situation and form an appropriate
strategy to turn it in your favor.
Identifying these impulsive instincts will also help you to discover the goals of
others. Impulsive actions, taken by others, offer insight into their goals. People
are most likely to become provoked when their power or the likelihood of
achieving their goals is under threat. Use your self-analysis to empathize with
people in these moments, place yourself in their shoes and understand what
drives them.
Analyzing Others
Along with empathy, using your self-analysis and lived experience to place
yourself in the shoes of others, you can also recognize the behavioral patterns of
other objectively.
The introduction to this chapter offers a nice summary. Here is an opportunity to
present the process of analyzing others in a more systematic manner:
            1. Begin by observing and recording every action that a person
               takes. Provide yourself with as much data as possible. Include
               every unusual mood, action, reaction and impulse.
            2. Hypothesize obvious and suspected goals which that person
               many possess.
            3. Test their actions in relation to these goals. Try to understand if
               the person is acting to achieve these goals, in which case your
               hypothesized goals are correct, or if the actions and your
               hypothesized goals fail to align, in which case you may need to
               consider that the person is pursuing alternative goals.
            4. Predict the actions of a person, based on their goals and the
               behavioral patterns (patterns in the actions they take) you
               observe. Specifically, when something unusual occurs, try to
               predict how they will react. Analyze your success and failures in
               prediction. Where you fail, try to understand why the person
               reacted as they did, why you failed to predict that and use it to
               inform your future predictions.
            5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 ad infinitum, until you can accurately
               predict the behavior of that person.
With this ability to predict the reaction of a person to a given event, it only
requires your creativity to reverse-engineer an event based on the reaction you
wish to produce. The event might be as simple and innocent as mentioning a
certain topic of conversation, revealing a piece of information or thanking them
for some work they’ve done.
Cold Reading
Cold reading is the practice of analyzing a person on a first meeting, or even a
first glance. This is a particularly useful skill because it allows you to manipulate
someone even in a single meeting. If you can analyze someone in a short space
of time, to the extent where you can predict their reactions to a stimulus, you
only need to provide that stimulus in order to achieve the desired result.
Everyone already cold reads, to a degree. Using stereotypes, it is common and
perfectly normal to form an opinion of someone based on their appearance,
including the clothes they wear, the look on their face, the shape and size of their
body, their accent, and even their ethnicity. The problem is that cold reading
tends to be fairly inaccurate. You cannot guarantee anything about a person
based simply on their appearance and people are liable to surprise you.
Effective cold reading is going to take practice and data. Make predictions about
new people you meet, memorize them or quickly record them, if you have an
opportunity, and then test them as you find out more about a person. Relate your
findings back to your first impressions of someone and consider if there was
anything you could have spotted, which might have given it away.
Body Language
Body language is useful as both a source of information, and an approach to
manipulation. It can form a part of both deception and persuasion.
You have probably heard quotes like “body language makes up 55% of all
communication,” before. Although the number, “55%,” is actually pretty useless,
the message remains clear that body language is an important part of the way
people communicate to one another.
Considering the fact that body language is so important, it’s no surprise that
everyone is able to read body language and react to it, to some degree. On a sub-
conscious level, you can probably already understand when someone disagrees
with what you are saying, or is interested, or just wants to stop talking to you
altogether. These cues are intended to be understood – without that, there would
be no point to their existence.
However, there are important ways to read the body language of others, which
can help you to analyze their intentions, even when they are attempting to
deceive you.
Facial Expressions
It’s a famous poker trope that everyone has a particular behavior which they
exhibit when “bluffing,” a form of deception intended to lead opponent players
to believe they have a stronger hand than they actually do. This is known as a
“tell.”
While there is some truth to this, and you may be able to spot giveaway signs to
recognize when a person is lying. However, this will be limited in accuracy and,
particularly in the poker, you might fall prey to a deception, in which someone is
deliberately putting on a tell, in order to throw you off the scent.
In reality, facial expressions tend to be extremely unreliable when determining if
someone is telling the truth or not. They are easy to fake and don’t offer much in
the way of help when it comes to analyzing others.
However, as a tool for manipulation, facial expressions happen to be somewhat
useful. One general tip is to give people a big eyebrow raise and light up your
face with interest upon greeting people. Most people greet one another with stern
professionalism – it’s such an easy tip but raising your eyebrows and smiling at
someone can create a lasting impression. There’s no need to be obsequious;
don’t coo or gaze. Just show comfort, confidence and a project a genuinely
positive reaction from seeing someone.
The power of positivity indicates to others that you have a willingness to be
constructive and helpful to others. People crave the influence of positive people,
as a positive attitude breeds achievement.
Reading Body Language
So, if the face is limited in reading the non-verbal communicative cues of a
person, where should you look? The answer happens to be relatively simple: the
feet.
Most people reflect their desire and their attention by pointing their feet. If you
sense something off about a conversation, and get the feeling someone would
like to be somewhere else, glance at their feet and, if they’re pointing towards
the door, there’s your clincher.
Naturally, you don’t want to spend all your time staring at someone’s feet. But
take a glance and use their position to recognize whether someone wants to be in
the conversation or not. If they’re pointing right at you, they’re likely to be a lot
more receptive to what you’re saying.
If they’re pointing away from you, it’s possible you might as well be talking to a
brick wall. Now, the reason for that can vary. It doesn’t necessarily mean they
don’t like you; they might just be late for another appointment or have other
things on their mind. You need to use your learned analysis and incorporate
body language to form a complete picture.
  Thank you for reading. You are now armed with
powerful techniques that you can use in many different
 ways. Wield this knowledge wisely and judiciously.
