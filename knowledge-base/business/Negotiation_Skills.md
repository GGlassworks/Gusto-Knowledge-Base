In a successful negotiation, everyone wins. The objective should be agreement, not victory.

Every desire that demands satisfaction and every need to be met-is at least potentially an occasion for
negotiation; whenever people exchange ideas with the intention of changing relationships, whenever they
confer for agreement, they are negotiating.

Introduction
(Suggestion: This guide will be easier to follow if you think about a specific negotiation or conflict situation you have recently
been involved in.)

In the course of a week, we are all involved in numerous situations that need to be dealt with through
negotiation; this occurs at work, at home, and at recreation. A conflict or negotiation situation is one in
which there is a conflict of interests or what one wants isn't necessarily what the other wants and where both
sides prefer to search for solutions, rather than giving in or breaking-off contact.
Few of us enjoy dealing with with conflicts-either with bosses, peers, subordinates, friends, or strangers.
This is particularly true when the conflict becomes hostile and when strong feelings become involved.
Resolving conflict can be mentally exhausting and emotionally draining.

But it is important to realize that conflict that requires resolution is neither good nor bad. There can be
positive and negative outcomes as seen in the box below. It can be destructive but can also play a productive
role for you personally and for your relationships-both personal and professional. The important point is to
manage the conflict, not to suppress conflict and not to let conflict escalate out of control. Many of us seek
to avoid conflict when it arises but there are many times when we should use conflict as a critical aspect of
creativity and motivation.

                                                                                                               Top

You will be constantly negotiating and resolving conflict throughout all of your professional and personal
life. Given that organizations are becoming less hierarchical, less based on positional authority, less based
on clear boundaries of responsibility and authority, it is likely that conflict will be an even greater
component of organizations in the future. Studies have shown that negotiation skills are among the most
significant determinants of career success. While negotiation is an art form to some degree, there are specific
techniques that anyone can learn. Understanding these techniques and developing your skills will be a
critical component of your career success and personal success.

                                                                                                               Top




Major Causes of Conflict

Opposing interests (or what we think are opposing interests) are at the core of most conflicts. In a modern complex
society, we confront these situations many times a day. The modern organization adds a whole new group of
potential causes of conflict that are already present:

       competition over scarce resources, time
       ambiguity over responsibility and authority:
       differences in perceptions, work styles, attitudes, communication problems, individual differences
       increasing interdependence as boundaries between individuals and groups become increasingly blurred
       reward systems: we work in situations with complex and often contradictory incentive systems
       differentiation: division of labor which is the basis for any organization causes people and groups to see
        situations differently and have different goals
       equity vs. equality: continuous tension exists between equity (the belief that we should be rewarded relative
        to our relative contributions) and equality (belief that everyone should receive the same or similar
        outcomes).

                                                                                                                 Top




The Five Modes of Responding to Conflict

It is useful to categorize the various responses we have to conflict in terms of two dimensions:

    1. how important or unimportant it is to satisfy our needs and
    2. how important or unimportant it is to satisfy the other person's needs.

Answering this questions results in the following five modes of conflict resolution. None is these is "right"
or "wrong". There are situations where any would be appropriate. For example, if we are cut off driving to
work, we may decide "avoidance" is the best option. Other times "avoidance" may be a poor alternative.
Similarly, collaboration may be appropriate sometimes but not at other times.

Competition: Distributive (win-lose) bargaining

        Satisfying your needs is important; satisfying the other's needs isn't important to you

Collaboration: Integrative (win-win)

        Satisfying both your needs and the other's needs is important

Compromising:

        Satisfying both your needs and the other's are moderately important

Avoiding:

        you are indifferent about satisfying either your needs or the other's needs: no action is likely

Accommodating:

        simply yield (it doesn't matter to you and it matters to the other person)

In general, most successful negotiators start off assuming collaborative (integrative) or win-win
negotiation. Most good negotiators will try for a win-win or aim at a situation where both sides feel they
won. Negotiations tend to go much better if both sides perceive they are in a win-win situation or both sides
approach the negotiation wanting to "create value" or satisfy both their own needs and the other's needs.

We will focus on the two most problematic types: Collaborative (integrative)
and Competitive (Distributive).

Of the two the more important is Collaborative since most of your negotiation and conflict resolution in
your personal and professional life will (or should) be of this nature. This is because most negotiation
involves situations where we want or need an on-going relationship with the other person. While it is
important to develop skills in "competitive" bargaining (eg. when buying a car), or skills that allow us to
satisfy our concerns while ignoring the other's goals, this approach has many negative consequences for both
our personal lives and for our professional careers especially if we are to have an on-going relationship with
the other person..



The key to successful negotiation is to shift the situation to a "win-win" even if it looks like a "win-lose" situation.
Almost all negotiation have at least some elements of win-win. Successful negotiations often depend on finding the
win-win aspects in any situation. Only shift to a win-lose mode if all else fails.



Reducing Conflict that Already Exists
Organizations also take steps to reduce conflict. The following list suggests some of these ways:

       physical separation
       hierarchy (the boss decides)
       bureaucratic approaches (rules, procedures)
       integrators and third-party intervention
       negotiation
       rotating members
       interdependent tasks and superordinate goals ("We are all in this together...")
       intergroup and interpersonal training

                                                                                                                      Top




Rational vs. the Emotional Components of Negotiation

All negotiations involve two levels: a rational decision making (substantive) process and a psychological (emotional)
process. The outcome of a negotiation is as likely to be a result of the psychological elements as it is the rational
element. In most cases, the failure of two people to reach the "optimal" resolution or best alternative stems from
intangible factors such as:

Psychological Factors that will affect negotiations

       how comfortable each feels about conflict
       how each perceives or mis-perceives the other
       the assumptions each makes about the other and the problem
       the attitudes and expectations about the other
       the decisions each makes about trust, about how important "winning" is, how important it is to avoid
        conflict, how much one likes or dislikes the other; how important it is to "not look foolish."

Understanding the "rational" part of the negotiation is relatively easy. Understanding the "psychological" part is
more difficult. We need to understand ourselves and our opponents psychologically. Failure to understand these
psychological needs and issues is at the root of most unsuccessful negotiations.

This is made more difficult because norms in most organizations discourage open expression of negative
personal feeings. Thus intense emotional onflicts are often expressed and rationalized as substnative issues.
People often drum up disagreements on trivial issues to provide justification for an emotional conflict with
another individual (Ware and Barnes).

                                                                                                                      Top

The Two Most Important Kinds of Bargaining: Distributive (win-lose) vs. Integrative
(win-win)

All bargaining situations can be divided into two categories:

Distributive (also called competitive, zero sum, win-lose or claiming value).

         In this kind of bargaining, one side "wins" and one side "loses." In this situation there are fixed resources to
         be divided so that the more one gets, the less the other gets. In this situation, one person's interests oppose
         the others. In many "buying" situations, the more the other person gets of your money, the less you have
         left. The dominant concern in this type of bargaining is usually maximizing one's own interests. Dominant
         strategies in this mode include manipulation, forcing, and withholding information. This version is also called
         "claiming value" since the goal in this type of situation is to increase your own value and decrease your
         opponent's.

Integrative (collaborative, win-win or creating value).

         In this kind of bargaining, there is a variable amount of resources to be divided and both sides can "win." The
         dominant concern here is to maximize joint outcomes. An example is resolving a different opinion about
         where you and a friend want to go to dinner. Another example is a performance appraisal situation with a
         subordinate or resolving a situation of a subordinate who keeps coming in late to work. Dominant strategies
         in this mode include cooperation, sharing information, and mutual problem solving. This type is also called
         "creating value" since the goal here is to have both sides leave the negotiating feeling they had greater value
         than before.

It needs to be emphasized that many situations contain elements of both distributive and integrative
bargaining.. For example, in negotiating a price with a customer, to some degree your interests oppose the
customer (you want a higher price; he wants a lower one) but to some degree you want your interests to
coincide (you want both your customer and you to satisfy both of your interests-you want to be happy; you
want your customer to be happy). The options can be seen in the table below:

                                                                                                                     Top




Integrative or Win-Win Bargaining: The Critical Points

        Plan and have a concrete strategy: Be clear on what is important to you
        Separate people from the problem
        Emphasize win-win solutions:
        Focus on interests, not positions
        Create Options for Mutual Gain: Generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do
       Aim for an outcome be based on some objective standard
       Consider the other party's situation:
       Know your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Alternative)
       Pay a lot of attention to the flow of negotiation
       Take the Intangibles into account
       Use Active Listening Skills

                                                                                                              Top




Do some thinking ahead of time:

Planning for the Negotiation

Before the negotiation it is helpful to plan. Know whether you are in a win-win or win-lose situation.

Be sure of your goals, positions, and underlying interests. Try to figure out the best resolution you can
expect, what is a fair and reasonable deal and what is a minimally acceptable deal. What information do you
have and what do you need. What are your competitive advantages and disadvantages. What is the other's
advantages and disadvantages. Give some thought to your strategy.

It is very important to be clear on what is important to you. Be clear about your real goals and real issues
and try to figure out the other person's real goals and issues. Too many negotiations fail because people are
so worried about being taken advantage of that they forget their needs. People who lose track of their own
goals will break off negotiations even if they have achieved their needs because they become more
concerned with whether the other side "won."

It is helpful to have a min-max strategy. Have a "walk-away" position. When entering a negotiation or
conflict resolution, make sure you have already thought about answers to these questions: Planning for the
negotiation: The min-max approach

   1.   What is the minimum I can accept to resolve the conflict?
   2.   What is the maximum I can ask for without appearing outrageous;
   3.   What is the maximum I can give away?
   4.   What is the least I can offer without appearing outrageous?
   5.   Try to predict the answers the other person will have to these questions

It is important to know your competitive advantage-your strongest points. Also you need to know the
advantages to the other's argument. Similarly, know your weaknesses and the other's weaknesses.

In most conflict resolution or negotiation situations you will have a continuing relationship with the other
person so it is important to leave the situation with both sides feeling they have "won." It is very important
that the other person doesn't feel that he or she "lost." When the other person loses, the results are often lack
of commitment to the agreement or even worse, retaliation. The most common failure is the failure of
negotiating parties to recognize (or search for) the integrative potential in a negotiating problem ; beneath
hardened positions are often common or shared interests.

Separate people from the problem

Address problems, not personalities: Avoid the tendency to attack your opponent personally; if the other
person feels threatened, he defends his self-esteem and makes attacking the real problem more difficult;
separate the people issues from the problem
Maintain a rational, goal oriented frame of mind: if your opponent attacks you personally, don't let him hook
you into an emotional reaction; let the other blow off steam without taking it personally; try to understand
the problem behind the aggression

Emphasize win-win solutions:

Even in what appears to be win-lose situaitons, there are often win-win solutions; look for an integrative
solution; create additional alternatives, such as low cost concessions that might have high value to the other
person; frame options in terms of the other person's interests; look for alternatives that allow your opponent
to declare victory

Find underlying interests

A key to success is finding the "integrative" issues--often they can be found in underlying interests.

We are used to identifying our own interests, but a critical element in negotiation is to come to
understanding the other person's underlying interests and underlying needs. With probing and exchanging
information we can find the commonalities between us and minimize the differences that seem to be evident.
Understanding these interests is the key to "integrative bargaining." The biggest source of failure in
negotiation is the failure to see the "integrative" element of most negotiation. Too often we think a situation
is win-lose when it is actually a win-win situation. This mistaken view causes us to often use the wrong
strategy. Consider a situation where your boss rates you lower on a performance appraisal than you think
you deserve. We often tend to see this as win-lose-either he/she gives in or I give in. There is probably a
much higher chance of a successful negotiation if you can turn this to a win-win negotiation.

A key part in finding common interests is the problem identification. It is important to define the problem
in a way that is mutually acceptable to both sides. This involves depersonalizing the problem so as not to
raise the defensiveness of the other person. Thus the student negotiating a problem with a professor is likely
to be more effective by defining the problem as "I need to understand this material better" or "I don't
understand this" rather than "You're not teaching the material very well."

Use an Objective Standard

Try to have the result be based on some objective standard. Make your negotiated decision based on
principles and results, not emotions or pressure; try to find objective criteria that both parties can use to
evaluate alternatives; don't succumb to emotional please, assertiveness, or stubborness

Try to understand the other person: Know his/her situation

Often we tend to focus on our needs, our goals, and our positions. To successfully resolve conflict, it is
important to focus also on the other person. We need to figure out what the other's goals, needs, and
positions are as well as their underlying interests. We need to think about the personality of the other person,
how far we can push, how open or concealed we should make our positions.

Acquire as much information about the other's interests and goals; what are the real needs vs. wants; what
constituencies must he or she appease? What is her strategy? Be prepared to frame solutions in terms of her
interests.

An important part of this is to recognize that people place very different values on issues than ourselves. For
example, a clean room may be much more important to you than it is to your roommate. We must
understand how the other person sees reality, not just how we see reality.

If through pressure, deception or sheer aggressiveness, we push people to the point where they see
themselves as likely to lose, this creates problems. The opponent will retaliate and fight back; losers often
lose commitment to their bargain. Also negotiators get reputations that can backfire. Remember that
settlements which are most satisfactory and durable are the ones that address the needs of both parties.

Know Your Best Alternative

Try to explore the other side's BATNA and certainly be aware of your own. See if you can change the other
person's BATNA. If the other person's BATNA is poor (the alternatives to reaching an agreement with you
are unattractive), you are in a better position.

                                                                                                                    Top




Paying Attention to the Flow of Negotiation:

Negotiation is a sequence of events

There is a tendency to think about conflict or the negotiating situation as an isolated incident. It is probably
more useful to think about conflict as a process, or a complex series of events over time involving both
external factors and internal social and psychological factors. Conflict episodes typically are affected by
preceding and in turn produce results and outcomes that affect the conflict dynamics.

A negotiation usually involves a number of steps including the exchange of proposals and counter proposals.
In good-faith negotiation, both sides are expected to make offers and concessions. Your goal here isnot only
to try to solve the problem, but to gain information- information that will enable you to get a clearer notion
of what the true issues might be and how your "opponent" sees reality. Through offers and counter offers
there should be a goal of a lot of information exchange that might yield a common definition of the problem.

Such an approach suggests the importance of perception-conflict is in the eye of the beholder. Thus,
situations which to an outside observer should produce conflict may not if the parties either ignore or choose
to ignore the conflict situation. Conversely, people can perceive a conflict situation when in reality there is
none.

Next, once aware of the conflict, both parties experience emotional reactions to it and think about it in
various ways. These emotions and thoughts are crucial to the course of the developing conflict. For example,
a negotiation can be greately affected if people react in anger perhaps resulting from past conflict.

Then based on the thoughts and emotions that arise in the process of conflict resolution, we formulate
specific intentions about the strategies we will use in the negotiation. These may be quite general (eg. plan to
use a cooperative approach) or quite specific (eg. use a specific negotiating tactic).

Finally, these intentions are translated into behavior. These behaviors in turn elicit some responde from the
other person and the process recycles.

This approach suggests we pay particular attention to these generalizations:

      Conflict is an ongoing process that occurs against a backdrop of continuing relationships and events;
      Such conflict involves the thoughts, perceptions, memories, and emotions of the people involved; these
       must be considered.
      Negotiations are like a chess match; have a strategy; anticipate how the other will respond; how strong is
       your position, and situation; how important is the issue; how important will it be to stick to a hardened
       position.
      Begin with a positive approach:Try to establish rapport and mutual trust before starting; try for a small
       concession early
      Pay little attention to initial offers: these are points of departure; they tend to be extreme and idealistic;
       focus on the other person's interests and your own goals and principles, while you generate other
       possibilities

                                                                                                                        Top




The Intangibles:

Other Elements that affect negotiation

Intangibles are often the key factors in many negotiations. Some of these intangibles are:

      Personalities: be conscious of aspects of your personality such of your own needs and interpersonal style as
       well as the other person's personality; these factors will play a key role and understanding yourself will be an
       important factor
      Your own personality and style: how much you trust the person; how free with your emotions; how much
       you want to conceal or reveal;
      Physical space: sometimes where the negotiation takes place can be important; are we negotiating in a
       space we are uncomfortable and other is comfortable?
      Past interaction: if there is a history of conflict resolution with this person, think about how this history
       might affect the upcoming negotiation
      Time pressure: Think about whether time pressure will affect the negotiation and whether you need to try
       to change this variable?
      Subjective utilities: be aware that people place very different values on elements of a negotiation. For
       example, in negotiating for a job, you may place a high value on location and relatively lower on salary; it is
       important to be aware of your subjective utilities and try to ascertain the other person's subjective utilities;
       it is difficult to know in advance or even during the negotiation what a particular outcome will mean to the
       other party. Finding out what is "valued" is one of the key parts of negotiation.
      Understand the Context for the Conflict
             o what are the important personal and organizational consequences of the conflict? What are possible
                  future consequences?
             o What behavior patterns characterize the conflict
             o What are the substantive issues? Are the issues biased by each side's perceptions and feelings?
             o What are the underlying or background factors that have lead to the situation and the related
                  feelings, perceptions, and behaviors?

Be an active Listener:

Good communication skills are critical although it is easy to forget them in the "heat of battle." Try to
separate the problem from the person. Focus on the problem (eg. "this accounting concept is unclear to me")
not the person (eg. "you did a lousy job explaining this"). When we tie the person to the problem, the other
person gets defensive and communication tends to become very difficult.
Don't: Talk at the other side, focus on the past, blame the other person. Do: Be an "active listener.

       This involves continuously checking to see if you are understanding the other person.
       Restate the other's position to make sure you are hearing him or her correctly. Focus on
       the future; talk about what is to be done; tackle the problem jointly.
                                                                                                                        Top
How can I change what seems like a "win-lose" situation to a "win-win" (or what if
the other person doesn't play by these rules?)

There are many advantages to trying to shift a win/lose situation to a win/win. Yet we
will be in situations where the other person either doesn't wish to reach a "win-win" or
doesn't realize it is in his or her best interest to achieve a collaborative solution. In these
situations it is necessary for us to open lines of communication, increasing trust and
cooperativeness.

Sometimes conflicts escalate, the atmosphere becomes charged with anger, frustration,
resentment, mistrust, hostility, and a sense of futility. Communication channels close
down or are used to criticize and blame the other. We focus on our next assault. The
original issues become blurred and ill-defined and new issues are added as the conflict
becomes personalized. Even if one side is willing to make concessions often hostility
prevents agreements. In such a conflict, perceived differences become magnified, each
side gets locked into their initial positions and each side resorts to lies, threats, distortions,
and other attempts to force the other party to comply with demands.

It is not easy to shift this situation to a win-win but the following lists some techniques
that you might use:

      reduce tension through humor, let the other "vent," acknowledge the other's
       views, listen actively, make a small concession as a signal of good faith
      increase the accuracy of communication; listen hard in the middle of conflict;
       rephrase the other's comments to make sure you hear them; mirror the other's
       views
      control issues: search for ways to slice the large issue into smaller pieces;
       depersonalize the conflict--separate the issues from the people
      establish commonalities: since conflict tends to magnify perceived differences
       and minimize similarities, look for greater common goals (we are in this together);
       find a common enemy; focus on what you have in common
      focus less on your position and more on a clear understanding of the other's
       needs and figure out ways to move toward them
      make a "yesable" proposal; refine their demand; reformulate; repackage;
       sweeten the offer; emphasize the positives
      find a legitimate or objective criteria to evaluate the solution (eg. the blue book
       value of a car)

                                                                                             Top



Some Tricks that Skilled Negotiators Use

We constantly trade-off in negotiations. An examples is when a union negotiation trades
wage gains for job security. An important ingredient of negotiation is assessing the trade-
offs. In general, we start by identifying the best and worst possible outcomes, and then
specify possible increments that trade-offs can reflect, and finally, consider how the
increments relate to the key issues.
If we pursue "integrative bargaining," we try to create gains for both parties. An example
is offering something less valuable to us but more valuable to the other person (eg., the
other person may highly value payment in cash rather than through financing whereas we
may be indifferent to this). The following are ways of creating joint gains.

When to reveal your position: This depends on the other person. It is not a good idea to
reveal your minimum position if the other person needs to feel he has worked hard to
reach it; the other person may need to feel he or she has worked very hard to move you to
your position.

Case from a workshop on negotiation:
We had to sell a training program to Sue, a former member of our law firm We knew she
needed to purchase a program and she also held a grudge against our firm. Mary heaped
abuse on us. I wanted to punch her, but Chuck (my partner) just smiled and began
applying some standard negotiating principles.

First, he identified our interests as the selling of a program at a decent price and the
maintenance of a good relationship with Mary and her law firm (focus on interests, not
positions). Next, he completely ignored Mary's obnoxious personality (separate people
from problems). And he offered to sell Mary only the latest program, with a price break
for a quick sale (options for mutual gain).

But his most effective technique was the "jujitsu." When the other side pushes, don't push
back. When they attack, don't counterattack; rethink their attack as an attack on mutual
problems. Two tools are used--ask questions instead of making statements, and respond
with prolonged silence in the face of unreason. Chuck used them both, and we completed
the sale and got a better price than we had hoped for. Other Techniques you can use

      Broadening the Pie: Create additional resources so that both sides can obtain
       their major goals
      Nonspecific Compensation: One side gets what it wants and the other is
       compensated on another issue
      Logrolling Each party makes concessions on low-priority issues in exchange for
       concessions on issues that it values more highly
      Cost Cutting: one party gets what it wants; the costs to the other are reduced or
       eliminated
      Bridging : Neither party gets its initial demands but a new option that satisfies the
       major interests of both sides are developed

                                                                                             Top



What if I want "to win" and I don't care about the other person's interests
(Distributive or win-lose Bargaining)

In this situation, strategy is different than in integrative bargaining. In this mode, one
seeks to gain advantage through concealing information, misleading, or using
manipulative actions. Of course, these methods have serious potential for negative
consequences. Yet even in this type of negotiation, both sides must feel that at the end the
outcome was the best that they could achieve and that it is worth accepting and
supporting.

Most critical in this mode is to set one's own opening target and resistance points and to
learn what the other's starting points, target points, and resistance points are. Typically,
the resistance point (the point beyond which a party will not go) is usually unknown until
late in negotiation and is often jealously concealed by the other party. This is what you
need to find out.

The range between resistance points is typically the bargaining range; if this number is
negative, successful negotiation is usually impossible. For example, if you are willing to
pay up to $3,000 and the seller is willing to go as low as $2800, there is a $200 positive
spread or bargaining range if the negotiators are skillful enough to figure it out. The goal
of a competitive bargaining situation is to get the final settlement to be as close to the
other party's resistance point as possible. The basic techniques open to the negotiator to
accomplish this include

      influence the other person's belief in what is possible (eg. a car dealer telling you
       what your used car is worth)
      learn as much as possible about the other person's position especially with regard
       to resistance points
      try to convince the other to change his/her mind about their ability to achieve
       their own goals
      promote your own objectives as desirable, necessary, ethical, or even inevitable.

                                                                                           Top



Is it ethical to "lie or bluff" in negotiations?

The answer to this question depends on one's values, one's culture, and the situation.
What might be acceptable in poker would probably not be acceptable in most business
situations. What might be acceptable in Cairo might not be acceptable in Boston.
Different cultures and different situations contain inherent "rules" about the degree to
which bluffing or misrepresentation is deemed acceptable.

In poker and in general negotiations one is not expected to reveal strength or intentions
prematurely. But discretion in making claims and statements syhould not be confused
with misrepresentation. In general, in our culture, our "rules" forbid and should penalize
outright lying, false claims, bribing an opponent, stealing secrets, or threatening an
opponent. While there may be a fine line between legitimate and illegitimate withholding
of facts, there is a line and again we are distinguishing between the careful planning of
when and how to reveal facts vs. outright lying.

Bluffing, while it may be ethical, does entail risk. The bluffer who is called loses
credibility and it can get out of hand. Also remember, that most negotiations are carried
out with people with whom you will have a continuing relationship. Again, while our
culture supports and encourages those who are careful about how and when to disclose
facts, out culture does not condone outright lying.

An old British Diplomat Service manual stated the following and it still might be useful.

Nothing may be said which is not true, but it is as unnecessary as it is sometimes
undesirable to say everything relevant which is true; and the facts given may bve arrange
din any convenient order. The perfect reply to an embarassing question is one that is
brief, appears to answer the question completely (if challenged it can be proved to be
accurate in every word), gives no opening for awkward follow-up questions, and
discloses really nothing.

Skilled negotiators develop techniques to do this. A favorite one is to answer a question
with a question to deflect the first question.

                                                                                          Top



Final Advice
Be unconditionally constructive. Approach a negotiation with this-- 'I accept you as an
equal negotiating partner; I respect your right to differ; I will be receptive.' Some
criticize my approach as being too soft. But negotiating by these principles is a sign of
strength.
                                                       R. Fisher and R. Ury,"Getting to Yes"

All of us engage in many negotiations during a week but that doesn't mean we become
better at it. To become better we need to become aware of the structure and dynamics of
negotiation and we need to think systematically, objectively, and critically about our own
negotiations. After engaging in a negotiation, reflect on what happened and figure out
what you did effectively and what you need to do better.

There is no one "best" style; each of us has to find a style that is comfortable for us. Yet,
everyone can negotiate successfully; everyone can reach agreements where all sides feel
at least some of their needs have been satisfied. This involves a lot of alertness, active
listening, good communication skills, great flexibility, good preparation, and above all it
involves a sharing of responsibility for solving the problem, not a view that this is "their"
problem.

To summarize the most important keys to successful conflict resolution:

      bargain over interests, not predetermined positions
      de-personalize the problem (separate the person from the problem)
      separate the problem definition from the search for solutions
      try to generate alternative solutions; try to use objective criteria as much as
       possible
      reflect on your negotiations; learn from your successes and mistakes
Have unlimited patience. Never corner an opponent and always assist the other person
to save his face. Put yourself in his shoes-so as to see things through his eyes. Avoid self-
righteousness like the devil-nothing is so self-blinding.

previous performance, unreasonabless, or anything that can imply the opponent is
worth little
the long pauser
list to the other side but don't answer immediately; appear to give it considerable
thought with long silences; hope the silence will get the other side to reveal information

the mocking negotiator
mock and sneer your opposition's proposals to get the other side so upset that they will
say something they may regret later
the interrogator
meet all proposals with searching questions that will imply the opponents haven't done
their homework; challenge any answers in a confronting manner and ask the opposition
to explain further what they mean
the cloak of reasonableness
appear to be reasonable while makng impossible demands for the purpose of winning
the friendship and confidence of the others
divide and conquer
produce dissension among opposition so they have to pay more attention to their own
internal disagreements rather than the disagreements with the opposition; ally with one
member of the team and try to play him or her off against the other members of the
team.
the "act dumb" negotiator
pretend to be particularly dense and by doing so exasperate the opposition in hopes
that at least one member of the opposing team will reveal information as he tries to find
increasingly simple ways to describe proposals with each proposal being elaborated and
amplified so anyone can understand it

Dealing with Difficult People

Hostile Aggressive

      Stand up for yourself; use self-assertive language
      give them time to run down......avoid a direct confrontation

Complainers

      Listen attentively; acknowledge their feelings; avoid complaining with them
      state the facts without apology.......use a problem solving mode

Claims:

      keep asking open ended questions; be patient in waiting for a response
      if no response occurs, tell them what you plan to do, because no discussion has
       taken place
Superaggreables:

      In a non-threatening manner, work hard to find out why they will not take action
      Let them know you value them as people
      Be ready to compromise and negotiate, and don't allow them to make unrealistic
       commitments
      Try to discern the hidden meaning in their humor

Negativists:

      Do not be dragged into their despair.........Do not try to cajole them out of their
       negativism
      Discuss the problems thoroughly, without offering solutions
      When alternatives are discussed, bring up the negatives yourself
      Be ready to take action alone, without their agreement

Know-it-Alls

      Bulldozers: Prepare yourself; listen and paraphrase their main points; question to
       raise problems
      Balloons: state facts or opinions as your own perception of reality; find a way for
       balloons to safe face; confront in private

Indecisive Stallers

      Raise the issue of why they are hesitant...Possibly remove the staller from the
       situation
      If you are the problem, ask for help.....Keep the action steps in your own hands

Some Principles of Third Person Mediation

      Acknlowledge that you know the conflict exists and propose an approach for
       resolving it
      Try to maintain a neutral position regarding the people in the dispute
      Make sure the discussion focuses on issues, not on personalities
      Try to get the people to focus on areas where they might agree
      Try to separate the issues and deal with them one at the time, starting with those
       where agreement might be easiest
      You are not a judge, but rather a facilitator; Judges deal with problems; you deal
       with solutions-your focus is not on who is right and who is wrong
      Make sure people agree on the solutions that are agreed upon

                                                                                         Top
from Negotiation to Win

If your approach is a win-lose or distributive bargaining approach, you might prefer
these ideas:
The Critical Rules

      no free gifts; trade every concession; use the big IF
      start high, make small concessions, especially in the end; try to have the other
       side make the first offer on the issues being negotiated
      be patient; remember to nibble at the end
      keep looking for creative concessions to trade

The Important but Obvious Rules

      do your homework; start slowly; set a complete agenda
      keep the climate positive; discuss small things first
      remember that everything is negotiable
      never accept their first offer; settle everything at the end
      leave the other side feeling it has done well
      consider using the good guy-bad guy approach
      try to have the other

                                                                                           Top

Look at these Overall Guidelines for Effective Negotiation and rank how well you did
(5=excellent); rank your "opponent"
Me Opponent

--- --- Consider the other party's situation:
acquire as much information about the other's interests and goals; what are the real needs
vs. wants; what constituencies must he or she appease? What is her strategy? Be prepared
to frame solutions in terms of her interests.

--- --- Have a concrete strategy:
Negotiations are like a chess match; have a strategy; anticipate how the other will
respond; how strong is your position, and situation; how important is the issue; how
important will it be to stick to a hardened position.

--- --- Begin with a positive approach:
Try to establish rapport and mutual trust before starting; try for a small concession early.

--- --- Address problems, not personalities:
Avoid the tendency to attack your opponent personally; if the other person feels
threatened, he defends his self-esteem and makes attacking the real problem more
difficult; separate the people issues from the problem

--- --- Maintain a rational, goal oriented frame of mind:
if your opponent attacks you personally, don't let him hook you into an emotional
reaction; let the other blow off steam without taking it personally; try to understand the
problem behind the aggression.

--- --- Pay little attention to initial offers:
these are points of departure; they tend to be extreme and idealistic; focus on the other
person's interests and your own goals and principles, while you generate other
possibilities.

--- --- Emphasize win-win solutions:
Even in what appears to be win-lose situaitons, there are often win-win solutions; look for
an integrative solution; create additional alternatives, such as low cost concessions that
might have high value to the other person; frame options in terms of the other person's
interests; look for alternatives that allow your opponent to declare victory

--- --- Insist on using objective criteria:
Make your negotiated decision based on principles and results, not emotions or pressure;
try to find objective criteria that both parties can use to evaluate alternatives; don't
succumb to emotional please, assertiveness, or stubborness

be more effective in negotiations.
