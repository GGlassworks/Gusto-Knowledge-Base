•   Check the box when
    everything has been
    completed                      Wondering approximately how long it will take you to complete a reading
                                   assignment? Time yourself reading 10 pages in each of your textbooks. Some
                                   books will take more time to read than others. You may want to make a note to
                                   yourself regarding the time it takes you to read 10 pages in each textbook.
Evaluate Yourself After Week #1
• How much time did you spend studying?
• Were there any tasks you didn’t complete?
 • How much additional time did you need?
• Were there any tasks that you hurried through and didn’t complete
  to the best of your abilities?
• Make adjustments for the following week!

Procrastination
• Now that we have looked at how to manage our time, we need to
  look at the topic of procrastination and how to overcome it.

• What are some reasons that people procrastinate?

• Are you a procrastinator?
 • Let’s take this self-test to determine if you are really a procrastinator or
   not.
Procrastination Self-Test
• Number your paper from 1 – 12.
• Read each statement below and choose the word that best describes your behavior. Write the
  corresponding number you choose on your paper.
      •   Never – 1          Occasionally – 2   Often – 3   Always – 4


•   1. I feel I have to “cram” before an exam.
•   2. My homework is turned in on time.
•   3. I think I get enough sleep.
•   4. I pull all-nighters before mid-terms and finals.
•   5. I plan activities with friends or family for a couple of nights a week and spend the amount of time with
    them that I planned.
•   6. When I’m working on a paper, I put off writing until a few days before it’s due.
•   7. I cancel social activities because I feel I don’t have enough time.
•   8. I get my papers in on time.
•   9. I find myself making a lot of excuses to my instructors about why my work isn’t done.
•   10. I feel comfortable about how I use time now.
•   11. I feel that something is hanging over my head, that I’ll never have enough time to do the work assigned.
•   12. I feel tired.

Score A – Add up the numbers for questions 1,4,6,7,9,11, and 12.
Score B – Add up the numbers for questions 2,3,5,8, and 10.

If Score A is greater than Score B, you are probably a procrastinator. If Score A is less than
Score B, you manage your time well. If the scores are equal, you may procrastinate at times,
but procrastination is not a habit.
Overcoming Procrastination
• Set realistic goals
• Do school work when your energy level is at its highest
• Break large tasks into smaller ones
• Work for realistic periods of time
• Avoid all-night study sessions
• Create an effective place to do your school work
• Allow extra time for unexpected things
• Schedule time for yourself
• Use your free time wisely
• Reward yourself when you have finished tasks on time
Additional Tips to Get the Most Out of Studying
• Study for 45-60 minutes at a time
• Take 10-15 minute breaks in between
• Switch subjects after each hour
• Start with the most difficult subject
• Reward yourself
• Work ahead—don’t wait until the last minute
Time Management Will Help You…

• Increase your productivity
• Reduce your stress
• Improve your self-esteem
• Achieve a sense of balance
• Establish an important
  career skill
