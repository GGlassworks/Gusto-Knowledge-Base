Time Management –
                          Time Use Chart and Log (Step 1)

OVERVIEW
Time management is not something you do just once and never
worry about again (e.g., creating a schedule). Time managing
is an ongoing process of awareness and control. It is also
closely tied to achieving the goals you have set for yourself. It
is important to understand that the times you spend “doing
nothing,” you are actually doing something — you are avoiding
achieving your goals!

PURPOSE
The following sets of activities are intended to help you
understand and build a realistic schedule and management
system that will allow you to maximize your efforts and overall
potential this semester. Additional time management strategies
are also included.
IT INCLUDES 3 ACTIVITIES:
 1 Time Use Chart and Log
 2 Ideal Schedule
 3 Master Calendar

• Begin by completing the Daily Time Log sheet. Be as
  accurate as possible. If you are taking a shower and getting
  ready, hanging out drinking a cup of coffee, or attending
  class, be sure to log this information. When you are studying
  for particular courses, identify the courses in the log. Carry
  this log with you and complete it over the course of the next
  week.

                                    Master Calendars (Step 3)

One of the differences and major benefits of classes at the
college level versus high school is the availability of your syllabi.
Unlike high school, many of your syllabi will give you a semester
schedule that includes major due dates and exam dates.
Unfortunately, many students do not take advantage of this
information.

The following page include an example “Master Calendar.” Your
own master calendar can easily be created by using any type
of document that allows you to insert a table. This one page
planning tool will help give you an overview of what you are
responsible for. The master calendar is used with your other
planners and/or planning tools. As one page, it allows you to
keep it with you and to see everything quickly. By completing
the master calendar now, it will allow you to do a couple of
things. First, it allows you to do your weekly and daily planning
based on what is coming up without flipping through multiple
course packets and syllabi (and potentially missing something).
Second, it allows you to identify and prevent any surprises. If
you have two papers and two exams in week 11, you can see it
now and plan accordingly. One recommendation is to start each
week (e.g., Sunday evenings) by planning your goals and to-do
lists for the week based on what is coming up on your master
calendar. Then, each evening, plan your next day based on your
weekly plan. Using your calendar will also allow you to break-up
major projects and papers into smaller parts and multiple due
dates. Breaking up efforts into smaller parts promotes greater
focus and higher motivation.

To complete the master calendar, include all important dates
that impact your schedule and planning (e.g., due dates, exams,
vacations, sports commitments, etc.). Some students will use
different colors to highlight different classes. Again, refer to
this calendar as you plan your days and weeks. Last minute
surprises can be a disaster so use your master calendar to plan
ahead — you are in control of your time!

              Other Time Management Strategies
Below is a list of potential time management strategies. Now that you have created an ideal schedule and master calendar,
consider the following strategies that will help you make the most of each day. It is likely that you are currently using
some of these strategies; however, there are probably many that you have not tried or considered. Be open to trying new
strategies and creating new and helpful efficiencies!
