                          SHOULD I BUILD
                          AN EXTENSION?
                          Many factors can effect your decision to build an extension. Your family
                          might be growing, your work requirements may have changed and you
                          need office space, or you might be looking to create a new space to build
                          your dream kitchen.

                          When the housing market becomes slow, extending your property can
                          be a smart option, especially if your current location is perfect for your
                          current or future lifestyle. This option has become incresibly popular in
                          recent years, helping homeowners to save money on stamp duty, along
                          with the other associated costs with moving to a new house.

                          Building an extension to your property also adds value. Whether it’s the
                          addition of a new bedroom, a loft conversion, conservatory or additional
                          toilets, your house will be worth significantly more. The amounts will
                          vary from property to property and will depend on various factors such
                          as location, build quality and type of extension.

                          Note, you will also need to consider the cost of the building works.
                          Adding £25,000 to the value of your property is great, but will not
                          be as beneficial if you have spent £40,000 in the process. The Office
                          for National Statistics can guide you on which parts of the country
                          extensions are most profitable and how much you can expect the value
                          of your home to increase by.

                          In this e-book, we will guide you through the stages of planning and
                          executing an extension project, factoring in all the considerations you will
                          need to make and providing you a foundation to work with to ensure you
                          get the most out of your new extension.




                                         The Office for National Statistics
                                           (ONS) reports that UK average
                                        house prices increased by 12.4% in
                                                    the year to April 2022.

In Nottingham, a small extension (15m²) on average would cost you between £1,200 and £1,500 per square
metre (sqm), and you can expect to increase your house value by £1,391 per sqm. Hence the importance of managing
your costs and considering the full worth of your investment.                                                           EXTENDING TO
In central London, where property is at such a premium, the rules of extension pricing vary hugely. In Kensington and
Chelsea, the cost is usually between £2,000 and £3,000 per sqm. However, you can expect to yield an added value of
£17,988 per sqm, although it may be challenging to gain planning permission.
                                                                                                                        ADD VALUE

EARLY STAGE
CONSIDERATIONS
There are three main types of extension: the rear extension, the side return
extension, and the wrapped extension.

A rear extension is one which extends from the back towards the garden.
These tend to be popular as they are often hidden from the front of the
house and therefore, won’t impose on the roadside view, allowing you to
create your design with more freedom.

A side return extension is an infill of the passage to the side of a property.
This is commonly between two homes and unlike rear extensions, which
often result in a loss of garden space, makes use of an otherwise unused
part of the property.

Wrapped extensions will run across both the side elevation and the back of
the property and can be either single or two storeys.

In many cases, unless your design is likely to impinge heavily on your
neighbours there is unlikely to be a planning permission objection,
however it is always worth checking out the latest planning advice via the
Government’s Planning Portal website. Indeed, many planners welcome
this as an improvement on what is there already.

If changing the style is likely to give you what you want, then go ahead.
Don’t forget that if the size of the extension you are building falls under
Permitted Development Rights the planners will be unable to have any
influence on your design so you can be as imaginative as you wish.

Even the smallest and simplest extension can transform your property.
You don’t always need more space to make this happen. Careful choice of
materials and an understanding of how light will flow through a space can
radically alter your home. Many architects are against extensions that are
a slavish copy of what already exists. It is much more beneficial to create
something new and exciting.

ROOF DESIGNS
Your house and window locations will often determine the style of roof you choose for your extension. Pitched roof
designs can often tie in well with the rest of the architecture of your property, whereas flat roofs, which are generally
designed to have a slight angle allowing for rainwater runoff, tend to make a more contemporary statement.

LAYOUT ESSENTIALS
Regardless of the type of extension you choose, and where it is located, it is vital that your new space connects seamlessly
with your existing house and the outdoors. Ensure time and consideration is put into reconfiguration of your internal
layout to guarantee a flow between rooms – it may be worth involving an experienced designer who can come up with
imaginative solutions as to how to best use the whole property.

                           OPEN PLAN LIVING OR ZONED?

                           More people are turning towards open plan living and the
                           feeling and avoiding closing off any spaces. Evaluating
                           at an early stage what you want to achieve from your
                           extension project can help you to better understand the
                           best design for your new bespoke home.

                           For example, you might want to create a new family space
                           which encompasses a large kitchen and dining area, or
                           you are looking at extending to create a new office.

                           You don’t need to use walls to separate areas. It may
                           be worth considering different floor levels within your
                           extension or your home to create new spaces within an
                           open planned living arrangement. Alternatively, to avoid
                           an open plan style taking over, organise your materials
                           and furniture to create different atmospheres within a
                           single room. Potentially using different floor coverings
                           and separators within the room can break away a family
                           orientated area from the entertaining space you may
                           encompass.

                           Remember that the more open planned your home and
                           your extension becomes, the harder it can be to keep
                           that space heated. Potentially incorporate heating setup
                           which can zone single rooms or simply prioritise good
                           thermal properties when sourcing materials if you’re in
                           need for an open plan living arrangement. The earlier
                           you can get these ideas noted, the easier it is to plan and
                           deliver these.




                           “A few years ago, everybody was
                           going for open-plan extensions,
                           but there’s a growing realisation
                           of the downsides of complete
                           open plan living, such as lack
                           of storage and nowhere for
                           adults/children to escape to,
                           and people are moving towards

     You will also need to think about the light
     you will be bringing into the extension and
     into the home. Natural daylight has been
     proven to have a positive impact on vision,


                                                    LIGHT
     orientation, productivity, alertness and
     general health, and it has been shown to
     influence social behaviour and cognitive
     performance.

     Introducing plenty of natural daylight into
     your new property also helps to emphasise
     the space in your home and brings a real
     connection with the outdoors. There are
     some very bespoke options available
     which will help modernise your extension
     and bring a completely new dimension to
     your property.

     Windows in the roof can bring in up to 3
     times the amount of light than a standard
     vertical window, so this is a great way to
     brighten up your space.

     Whether you choose a flat roof or pitched
     roof, you can benefit from frameless
     rooflights, to allow light to flow through
     your whole home. You could even
     introduce an access rooflight if you are
     considering adding a roof terrace, helping
     to not only flood the extension with natural
     daylight but also unlock new areas of your
     property.

     A well-designed, open plan layout can
     make for a light, spacious and sociable
     home, but note down your ideas early
     and plan these out in the initial stages
     to explore your options and how they
     will help you realise your properties full
     potential.

                The importance of introducing natural daylight has led to the blurred

LIGHT

The most obvious reason for incorporating rooflights
and roof windows into your property is to increase the
natural daylight entering your new extension. Fixed flat
glass rooflights are a simplistic, cost-effective method
for sourcing light into your home. These can come in a
variety of shapes and sizes, including multipart options
for when you need an extremely large piece of glass –
ideal if you want almost the entire roof to be glazed.

Other fixed rooflights can be provided for more
detailed designs, which can add a wow factor to a
home, linking together a new extension to the old
building or showcasing unrivalled views. Products such
as Eaves rooflights which comprises of two or more
glazed sections installed in both vertical and horizontal
planes, joined together with a structural silicone seal.
Alternatively, a glass ridge rooflight designed to be
installed over the apex of your pitched roof and allow
glazing on both returns.

AIR

Rooflights are an ideal solution for creating wind driven
ventilation within your design and is most effective when
the rooflight is combined with another opening on a
different side of the building.

There are several ways of doing this, you could opt for a
cost-effective hinged ventilation unit or go for something
more ambitious by including a sliding rooflight.

Rooflights such as this offer complete control over the
ventilation in a room but also acts as incredible feature
to your room. In many domestic applications, natural
ventilation products such as the sliding rooflight offer a
tangible connection with the outdoors and can transform
the interior living space at the touch of a button.

                                                          SPACE

                                                          Making the most of useable space on your property can yield
                                                          big rewards, and gaining extra space on top of your extension
                                                          can help to potentially add value to your home.

                                                          There are several options which will allow access to the roof
                                                          from simple maintenance hatches, larger hinged access units
                                                          or sliding glass box rooflights.

                                                          Occasionally you may encounter planning issues in some
                                                          cases, relating to potential increase to the building height,
                                                          particularly where this will exceed any existing balustrading or
                                                          parapet wall.

                                                          This is most likely to restrict the use of box rooflights but other
                                                          options such as the Skydoor hinged access rooflight are more
                                                          likely to be accepted as an alternative option due to its lower
                                                          profile when closed.

                                                          Adding space is not always a case of considering access
                                                          options. Traditional methods incorporating roof glazing can
                                                          also open up additional spaces and add value to your property.
                                                          A walk on glass rooflight can be installed flush with the terrace
                                                          paving on top of your newly built extension which can allow
                                                          full use of the space above whilst at the same time providing
                                                          natural daylight to the extension below.

                                                          STOCK OR BESPOKE

                                                          Another consideration will be whether to go for a stock (off
                                                          the shelf) rooflight or roof window, or whether to develop a
                                                          bespoke option. Off the shelf rooflights come with benefits,
                                                          such as a shorter lead time and cheaper price. However, if your
                                                          budget can stretch, choosing a bespoke rooflight allows you
                                                          the freedom to take advantage of something which will add

SPECIFY THE
RIGHT GLAZING
FOR YOUR
APPLICATION
With glass becoming a more popular material to use
within extensions it is even more important to think about
thermal performance, energy efficiency and safety.

When you are choosing rooflights for domestic
applications, the first choice for the inner pane should be
a laminated glass – this minimises the risk of any glass
falling into the room beneath should the inner pane
break.

When considering energy efficiency of your rooflight,
it’s important that you search for the products ‘whole
product’ U-values to ensure the thermal performance
will allow you to be compliant with Part L Building
Regulations. ‘Centre pane’ U-values are often quoted by
some manufacturers, but these do not consider edge
spacers and frame construction. You can learn more
about Part L Building Regulations by downloading our
guide.

                           SURROUNDINGS
                            When specifying a rooflight or roof window, it is important
                            to also factor in the surroundings and whether there are
                            any implications around the type of rooflight which you
                            can use. Questions to ask are:


                            Will it be positioned where it is subject to high
                            thermal stress?

                            Can something fall on the glass?

                            Will it require wall abutments?

                            Will the rooflight be subject to foot traffic?

                            Understanding these elements and discussing them early
                            on with your rooflight supplier and manufacturer will help
                            to eradicate problems further down the line. Companies
                            such as Glazing Vision have blog posts full of information
                            to help you understand what the best option for your
                            extension is.

                            A good rooflight supplier will design and manufacture
                            their own products and ideally be specialists in their field.
                            Look for companies with in-house design experience
                            like Glazing Vision; this ensures that they have complete
                            control over each stage of the manufacturing process.
                            UK manufacturing facilities should also allow you to view
                            the products first-hand and ask further questions prior to
                            purchase.

                           PETS AND ANIMALS
                           Having work carried out on your house can be a stressful time, even for your animals. It is
                           important to plan ahead unless you intend to leave your pet with a family member or put
                           them into kennels.

                           The best method is to keep animals and any works well apart. If you can leave your pets
                           in a room that won’t be affected by any new works, it is highly advised. If access doors are
                           removed, it may be worth investing in a baby gate which can still provide separation between
                           the areas. Similarly, it would be worthwhile noting where animals are being kept preventing
                           workmen accidentally stumbling across them or letting them out.

                           It might be worth hanging about during the initial phases to ensure there is minimal distress
                           from the animal and helping to prevent your animals from reacting negatively to strangers in
                           their home.

                           Pets4Homes’ advice throughout a project is to maintain some level of normality
                           and routine to their lives. This will help to ease the disruption during a project build
                           - simple things such as, walking them at the same time and feeding them at the
                           same time will help to ease them back into some normality throughout the process.

                           YOUR BUILD
                           Any renovation project you undertake has the potential to be an expensive
                           experience. Even those with sizeable savings may need to look at additional
                           finance at some stage of the project.

                           The best home improvement financing option for you may depend on your
                           individual circumstances, the amount you can afford each month, and the type
                           of project you’re carrying out. A useful starting point is to find out how much
                           you will need to borrow for your extension.

                           When setting your budget, it is important to have a clear idea of what extension
                           design you want to go ahead with, how many stories and what you plan to

                           Start collecting prices, remember to include all the upfront design fees, labour
                           and materials and most importantly include a contingency buffer of around 15-
                           20% of the total cost, which will help fund any unexpected issues. This will help
                           you to build an idea of what you’ll need to fund for your project.

                           Make sure you shop around and find the best price for the best quality of work.
                           It is recommended that you get at least 3-5 different quotes for your build.

                           For those who don’t have the savings to fund their project, there are several
                           options which are potentially worth your while looking over, dependant on
                           your circumstances. Remember it is always worth speaking to your bank who
                           can provide you with financial assistance regarding the best option dependant
                           on the amount you’re looking to finance.

     securely and with structural integrity. However, it is difficult to fully plan out costs
     until you start on site. Without knowing what is under the ground, complications
     such as moving drains or dealing with tree roots, can slow down the process and
     increase costs.

     The Shell

     The main building of the extension is erecting the shell. Building a basic structure,
     a roof with rooflights and interior elements such as plasterboard and a subfloor are
     added to ensure a watertight structure. Costs will be related to the size of your build
     and it’s something you should be able to be quoted for quite easily.

     Fitting

     The cost of the fit out of your extension will depend on the type of products you
     buy - this stage includes features such as skirting boards, doors, radiators and
     rooflights. Ensuring you buy from reputable companies who can advise on the right
     products for your home will be essentially to cutting down costs in the long run.

References are important – all builders should be able to
provide references of work they’ve completed, contact
these people and ask how happy they were with the
quality of workmanship and builder’s conduct.

Prepare a brief – this is your project. Make sure you are
able to provide them with all the relevant drawings,
a brief of work you expect from them and your cost
expectations. You can then provide this brief to each
builder to quote for the works. The clearer and more
precise the better, this will avoid any additional costs at a
later stage.

Get quotes in – ask at least 2 builders and get a full
breakdown of their quote. Read the quotes carefully,
don’t always go for the cheapest and ensure everything
you wanted is included. Make sure there is nothing
missing and that all language used is clear and
understandable – is it supply and fit or fit only? If it’s
supply and fit, what is included in the supply?

FINDING A
STRUCTURAL
ENGINEER
When making home improvements that involve the stability of a
building you will probably need a structural engineer.

A structural engineer is an engineer who specialises in the
structure of buildings. With the ability to determine the strength
and durability of your building, they are able to assess the safety
and provide specifications and calculations for the design. Your
structural engineer will be able to aid in the calculation of the
weight of your proposed structure and specify key elements such
as steel beams.

If you are using an architect, they will advise whether you
need to use a structural engineer and may even be able to
recommend one. Otherwise, you may need to invest some time
researching for a local structural engineer with experience of
residential properties.

To help find a structural engineer you can visit istructe.org where
you should be able to find a registered professional. As with
anyone involved in your project, it’s important to make sure your
structural engineer has Professional Indemnity insurance.

FOUNDATIONS AND
GROUNDWORKS
The foundations of your build are a crucial stage. Your local
planning authority will be keen to ensure that your extension
is built in the position shown on the approved drawings from
your architect.

It will be important for you and your builder to map out your
boundaries, not only from a planning perspective but also to
avoid any issues with overlooking neighbouring buildings.
Once you have set the boundaries, it may be a worthwhile
exercise to spray chalk lines on to the ground to clarify the
dimensions.

If you have any trees in your construction area that need
removing, it is important to have these assessed for TPO –
Tree Protection Order. This is a scheme that was put in place
to protect trees of significance and should have been covered
in your planning process but if the council hasn’t been
consulted, it would be worthwhile checking this before any
removal begins.

Foundations are required to transmit the load of the building
safely to the ground. Therefore, it is important to understand
the different factors which can affect the type of foundations
you will require, prior to starting, as this can help to avoid any
problems further down the line and help prevent avoidable
costs.

                                          FIRST FIX PLUMBING

                                          Most people when considering an extension will involve
                                          a bathroom, toilet, or kitchen in their new space. If this is
                                          the case, it will be necessary to extend the water supply.
                                          Even if this is not the case, the additional heating (and
                                          radiators) will still be required.

                                          First fix plumbing essentially covers the pipework for
                                          water supply, space heating and wastewater drainage
                                          from your property. Whether you decide to use copper
                                          or plastic pipework, it can be a good idea to install some
                                          extra fittings at the first fix stage - this helps enhance
                                          performance and make maintenance easier.




                                                                                 TOP TIP
                           Pay particular attention to the neatness and tidiness of the plumbing, this
                                                            is usually the mark of good workmanship.



                                          Depending on how you plan to heat your property, will
                                          affect which system is installed and how this is fitted
                                          together. If you choose to install radiators, it is important
                                          to understand whether your existing boiler capacity
                                          can take these or whether it will be too much stress.
                                          Building regulations now require that all boilers fitted
                                          are condensing boilers as they are much more energy
                                          efficient, so it may be a worthwhile time to invest in a new
                                          system.

                                          Alternatively, you can choose to install underfloor heating,
                                          which uses the floor itself as a radiator and removes the
                                          need for wall space. There are two different types, a wet
                                          system, which pumps water through pipes installed into
                                          a floor screed or a dry (electric) system, which use a very
                                          thin mat laid directly under your floor covering.

                                          For extensions, wet systems are favoured as these can be
                                          installed during the construction process and can provide
                                          a very efficient method of heating your home compared
                                          to radiators as they are heated to a lower temperature
                                          whilst achieving the same result.

                                          Once all the stages of the first fix are completed, these
                                          will then be covered up by the plasterwork or drylining –
                                          the base for the internal wall decoration. Dry lining is the
                                          quickest and most cost-effective method being used as a
                                          way of finishing your internal surfaces due to their drying
                                          timeline being days compared to the months it can take
                                          for wet plaster. This means that decoration can begin
                                          shortly after the dry lining has been applied.

SECOND STAGE
FIX
Once plastering has been completed and is dry, it will be time for the
‘second fix’. This is thought of as anything that is functional and not
purely decorative. Dependant on what you plan to use this extension
for will determine how much needs to be fitted by each trade.

At the second fix stage of your build, you will start to fit all the internal
features of a property, this will include your hard flooring, skirting
boards, internal doors, boxing in pipes, along with any potential
kitchen, bathroom.

SECOND FIX ELECTRICAL FITTINGS
At this stage you should have wires protruding through neat holes
cut into the new plastered walls. During the second fix, all switches,
power sockets and light fittings will need fitting to the protruding
wiring. There are plenty of different light switches and fittings to
choose from, so do research and ensure you have selected ones
which will blend in with the rest of your home.

Using energy saving bulbs will be a requirement from Building
Regulations to make your extension more efficient, bare this in
mind when purchasing. Building Regulations will also require any
lightening in a bathroom is sealed into the ceiling to prevent direct
contact with water.

Once all the electrics are completed and fitted, they will be safety
tested and certified.

SECOND FIX PLUMBING
Second fix plumbing will tidy up your pipes and start the connections
to fitted kitchen units, sanitary systems, and the boiler. Once
connected, Building Control will want to inspect the site, testing for
any leaks, fluent discharge, and a working boiler.

At this point you can begin to start decorating your extension
and filling it with furnishings that complement the extra
space and your new property.

The plans have been made, the build has been completed
and you are looking at the new extension built onto your
home. It’s hugely exciting to want to decorate and start
living inside your home properly again, however there are a
few necessary steps to take to make sure you have a formal
completion – and to make sure it’s finished to a standard
you’re happy with.

You will need your building control inspector to visit and
issue your completion certificate. This confirms that the
property complies with current Building Regulations and is
ready for occupancy – you should file this carefully as this
will be required should you ever plan to sell your property.

Whilst your extension is now essentially finished, it is usual
for a small percentage (2-5%) of construction costs to be held
back until an agreed date against snagging work – this will
need to be included in the contract before the project begins.
SNAGGING

Snagging is done a few months after your project is
completed and allows your extension time to bed in
and settle. This is your chance to have genuine faults
corrected.

Firstly, agree a date with your builder and do a walk
around your home, detailing any faults you feel
                                                                 SNAGGING CHECKLIST
