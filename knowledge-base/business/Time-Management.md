Introduction


Time management is all about organising yourself
and your work to make the most out of the time you
have.

If you never have enough time to finish your tasks,
better time management will help you regain control
of your day.

Good time management doesn't mean you do more
work, it means you focus on the tasks that matter
and will make a difference. These tasks could be
studying, working or socialising. Learning how to
manage your time effectively will help you feel more
relaxed, focused and in control.

How well do you manage your time?


Take a moment to think about how you currently
manage your time - ask yourself the following
questions:

   1. Do you set yourself long, medium and short
      term goals to help plan how you use your
      time?
   2. Do you have a realistic idea of how long
      activities will take?
   3. Do you know exactly how much time you
      need to spend studying each week?
   4. Do you write a daily 'to-do' list?
   5. Are the tasks you work on during the day the
      ones with the highest priority?
   6. Do you have a diary that you regularly use to
      keep track of your activities?
   7. Do you set specific goals for each study
      period?
   8. Do you complete your studying during your
      most productive hours each day?

If you answered 'no' to any of the questions above,
then you will benefit from some of the tips below!



                                                      4
Planning and Prioritising
Planning and prioritising your tasks and activities is
simple – all you need to do is remember these three
key elements:

Set your goals
Firstly, you need to work out what your long,
medium and short term goals are. What do you
want to achieve this year? What about this
semester, this month and this week? Having a
clear idea about your goals will help you plan what
you need to do. It's often worth writing your goals
down and sticking them somewhere visible to
remind you what they are!

Having something to focus on can make a huge
difference in how you manage your time.

Prioritise and Plan your tasks

To-do Lists

To-Do lists are a great way of planning the tasks
you need to do!

However, to get the most out of your list, you should
prioritise and schedule your tasks.

Prioritising your tasks

Once you have your To-Do list, think about what are
the most urgent and important tasks. What can be
left for another time?




                                                    6
There are many tools to help you plan and prioritise.
One of the most effective is shown below:

                         High   Urgency      Low




                  1                   2
    High
    Importance




                  3                   4
    Low




Decide what sits in each quadrant

•         Quadrant 1 - Do these first and do these well.
•         Quadrant 2 - Plan these carefully and do next.
•         Quadrant 3 - Try to delegate, then turn full
          attention to 2.
•         Quadrant 4 - Bin these!



                                                           7
Schedule your time!
Once you have prioritised your tasks, schedule
blocks of time to do them.

The table below can be used to help schedule your
tasks over a week – take 5 blocks of time you have
in the week and schedule the five most
important/urgent tasks you need to do.



       Block of time            Kind of activity

       1.

       2.

       3.

       4.

       5.

       6. All other time        All other activities



This technique works particularly well when you
identify the key blocks of time you work most
effectively. When you do this it means that you are
                                                       8
using your best times of the day to do your most
important work!

This may be eight in the morning for some people
and seven at night for others, but whenever your
key block of time is, this is when you should be
doing your key tasks and not checking email or
browsing on the internet!

Try taking the keys tasks identified in your To-Do
list and schedule these in for the week ahead in
prime time blocks – for example when you are most
energetic/creative. The rest of what needs to be
done should be placed in the other times – which
can be called poor time when routine, dull or
unchallenging tasks can be completed.

This technique might not be for everybody, but it
should provide a starting point for managing your
time – you need to find a method that suits you.

The Importance of Diaries and Calendars
In order to plan and prioritise effectively, it is
essential to have a diary or time sheet of some kind.
You may find using an electronic calendar, such as
those found in Google mail or Outlook useful. You
may also have a calendar on your mobile phone or
iPhone that you use.

Whichever method, make sure that you use your
diary to put appointments, deadlines and other
important things in. You might also find it useful to
block time out in your diary to do important tasks
such as reading, writing essays and attending
lectures.

Time stealers!
What are your time stealers?

Many people find they have things that steal their
time. The most common are:

   1. Procrastination
   2. Email
   3. Internet
   4. Mobile phones
   5. Other people

How can you beat these time stealers?

Procrastination
Procrastination is where you put something off
because you find it overwhelming or unpleasant. In
order to beat procrastination, you need to recognise
that you’re doing it first and then work out some
strategies to beat it!

Possible strategies for beating procrastination are:

   1. Reward yourself for doing the work.
   2. Ask someone to check whether you’ve done
      the work.
   3. Think about the bad things that will happen if
      you don’t do the work – like failing.
                                                     11
   4. Break the work into small tasks and do the
      easiest first.
   5. Do the hardest or most unpleasant bit first.


Emails and messages
Email or online messaging is a big time stealer for
many people – the ‘ping’ of something new in your
inbox is very inviting when you’re doing something
difficult. Set yourself set times for checking
messages during the day and turn your notifications
off in between. This will remove the temptation to
read everything that comes into your inbox.




                                                     12
Internet
The internet is a massive time stealer. You start
doing some internet research, twenty minutes later,
you’re checking your Facebook, two hours later,
and you haven’t actually done any work.

How do you beat the internet?

   1. Turn off the internet.
   2. Disconnect your Wi-Fi.
   3. Take yourself somewhere where you can’t
      access the internet.
   4. Use the internet as a reward!


Mobile phones

Again, mobiles can be very distracting. Some
simple tips to help:

   1. Turn your phone off/switch to airplane mode
   2. Put it in a drawer/keep in bag.




                                                 13
Finally…Top tips for success!
  1. Set realistic goals – long and short term.
  2. Work on key tasks every day – focus on
      importance rather than urgency.
  3. Break tasks down.
  4. Start with important tasks that you don’t want
      to do.
  5. Group similar activities together.
  6. Allow for the unexpected – don’t fill every
      minute.
  7. Schedule planning time.
  8. Write a daily ‘do to’ list and prioritise (and
      stick to it!)
  9. Estimate time\per task (and add to it).
  10. Set up effective systems for managing
      people and emails.
  11. Use your prime time.
  12. Don’t procrastinate – start elsewhere.
