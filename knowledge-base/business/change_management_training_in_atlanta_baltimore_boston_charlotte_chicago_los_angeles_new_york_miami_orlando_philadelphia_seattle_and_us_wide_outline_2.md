Change
While many people find it difficult to deal with change in the workplace, the
concept of continuous improvement should be embraced and used for the
growth of any organisation. And continuous improvement almost always
requires some form of change to internal systems and processes that people
have become comfortable with. An organisation that plans and prepares for
change is better able to overcome these challenges and implement
improvements as required.
Internal changes should be implemented after the creation of the new strategy
or system, however most organisations and/or employees are not prepared for
internal changes to policies or external strategies. Hence the requirement for
change management training is commonplace in most industries.
The PD Training Change Management Training Course provides participants
with training and development in each step of the change process including
the planning and preparation stages and the communication and
implementation stages. Being prepared for the changes allows your
organisation to grow steadily in spite of the potential pushback by staff. If
everyone is included in the change process, the staff will experience much
less frustration, stress, attrition, etc.
This practical, professional development training course in Change
Management is available now across the U.S., including Atlanta, Austin,
Baltimore, Birmingham, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Jackson,
Los Angeles, Manhattan, Miami, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, San Antonio

changes more smoothly and to have those changes better accepted. This workshop will also
give all participants an understanding of how change is implemented and some tools for
managing staff's reactions to change.

Change Management Training is important in today’s professional world as organisational
change is more the norm rather than the exception. More than ever, work roles and
organisations are in a state of flux with changes in structure, re-deployment, return to work,
redundancy and personal crisis. Hence it is important to understand the change
management process and learn some important change management tools.

Change takes place on three different levels:
    the Individual
    the Team
    the Organisation

Organisational change management has to happen at all three levels, as they are directly
interrelated.

This Change Management Training Program is geared toward teaching the change
management process as well as providing you with some change management tools and
principles that can support managers, consultants and other change facilitators to fulfil their
mission; to initiate and sustain change/improvement processes.
