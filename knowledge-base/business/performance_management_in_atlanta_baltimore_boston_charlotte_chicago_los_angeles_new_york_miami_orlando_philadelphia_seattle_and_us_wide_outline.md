What You’ll Gain:
Performance Management is not a company’s way of employing “micro-managing”
techniques that stunt the professional growth of its employees. But rather, it is a strategic
approach to ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of an organization. Whether at the
organizational, departmental or employee level, the goal of performance management is to
make sure all business goals are being met in a satisfactorily manner.
