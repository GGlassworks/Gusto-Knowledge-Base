2014 AASA SUPERINTENDENTS SALARY & BENEFITS STUDY




INTRODUCTION

The 2014 AASA Superintendents Salary and Benefits Study is intended to provide
superintendents with actionable information needed to manage their compensation.
This edition marks the third year the association has undertaken a comprehensive study
on public school superintendent compensation. Prior to that, most school
superintendents had to rely on the annual salary study sponsored by Education
Research Service (ERS) to benchmark their compensation and benefits. With the closure
of ERS, a void was created for such data. AASA responded to this need by creating a
comprehensive study of the salary and benefits of school superintendents that far
exceeded previous studies undertaken on this topic. AASA is particularly well-suited
for this task because it represents the vast majority of school superintendents in the
country and has been most active in collecting and disseminating to its members critical
data needed to inform decision making. AASA is committed to refining this work over
time, thus maximizing the benefit to superintendents. The preceding editions of this
study are available on the AASA website
(http://www.aasa.org/content.aspx?id=33054) and provide valuable retrospective
data. This work complements The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study
(Kowalski et al. 2010), also sponsored by AASA, and available from Roman & Littlefield
(https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781607099963).

The research team authoring this report of findings was led by Leslie A. Finnan, AASA
policy analyst; Robert S. McCord, AASA research professor in residence; and Noelle
Ellerson, AASA associate executive director, policy and advocacy. The research team
was assisted in review and analysis by Christopher C. Stream, associate professor of the
School of Environmental and Public Affairs, University of Nevada, Las Vegas and by
George J. Petersen, founding dean, Eugene T. Moore School of Education, Clemson
University.
METHODOLOGY

An extensive survey instrument was developed in 2012 and with the assistance of
Professors Theodore J. Kowalski (University of Dayton), I. Phillip Young (University of
South Carolina), Terry Orr (Bank Street College), and Christopher C. Stream (University
of Nevada, Las Vegas). This survey instrument was further refined for use in 2014 as a
result of input received from superintendents participating in the 2012 and 2013 studies
(see Section #11). Using a commercially prepared mailing list of American public school
superintendents, more than 9,000 email invitations to participate were distributed
during the month of September 2014. At the same time, state association executive
directors were contacted to encourage their members to respond to the Internet survey.
Superintendents had the capacity to forward the link to their staff members for input in
completing the survey in their area of expertise. The response to the 2012 study
numbered 1,280 or about 14 percent, while the number of superintendents responding
to the 2013 study nearly doubled to 2,369 or more than 25 percent. The 2014 survey
resulted in 1,711 responses, or about 19 percent of those surveyed.

REPORT OF FINDINGS

This report of findings is divided into 9 sections and solely relies on measures of central
tendency for this initial analysis of the data collected. These data were generally
disaggregated by gender, district enrollment and racial/ethnic group. A significant
body of data was collected with the central core of the data reported in this document.

As with any ambitious effort of this sort, there are limitations on the proper use of the
data that must be identified. Upon reflection and careful analysis, there are two
limitations that should be taken into account when using these data. First, sufficient
data was collected to guide superintendents in the development of their compensation
packages save one important factor – in some cases the disaggregation by racial/ethnic
group did not provide a sufficient number of responses to support decision making
based on this category. Care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences
on this particular data element. Second, survey fatigue is apparent among
superintendents and impacted the return rate. Superintendents are inundated with
research requests resulting in selective participation in those studies seen as most
important to the role of the superintendent or of benefit to their district. While
retreating somewhat in the 2014 study, the dramatic growth in the 2013 response rate
over that received in 2012 is an indication of the importance superintendents place on
collecting these data, while the participation rate of just over a quarter of all
superintendents is less than is desired and reasonably raises questions of whether the
data fairly represents the entire population.

Having clearly identified the limitations inherent in any endeavor of this sort, the report
that follows is rich with information that can prove useful to superintendents.
SOME NOTEWORTHY FINDINGS

For the purpose of bringing attention to some of the most noteworthy findings, a few of
those have been repeated below.

      A total of 1,711 usable responses were received for the 2014 study or slightly over
       19 percent of those contacted. This return represents a reduction by
       approximately 6 percent compared with 2013 returns but a significant increase
       over 2012 return rates. This response rate seems to suggest a strong interest on
       the part of superintendents for the collection and analysis of salary and benefits
       data.
      All states were represented. No state appears to be overrepresented.
      Similar to the previous studies, respondents arrayed by gender favor males over
       females in a slightly more than three to one ratio which is consistent to the
       respondents in The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study. It is also
       noted that female participation fell by approximately 2 percent over previous
       levels while male participation grew by the same amount.
      Whites (non-Hispanic) dominate the respondent ranks regardless of the gender.
      When gender and district enrollment of respondents are taken into account, the
       majority of superintendents participating in the survey were from intermediate
       size districts (300-2,499 students) regardless of their gender.
      When asked to describe the setting of their district, more than 70 percent of the
       respondents, regardless of gender, indicated that their district was best described
       as rural while about a fifth describe their district as suburban. This represents an
       increase in rural respondents and decrease in suburban and urban response
       levels.
      In a new item to the annual survey, respondents were asked their age. As a
       confirmation of that found in The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial
       Study, females were found to be older than their male counterparts in both mean
       and median data.
      When asked about their longevity in their present position, nearly half indicated
       one to five years with longer longevity favoring males.
      When compared with the 2013 results, a small trend toward longer longevity
       was indicated. Additional data points would have to be established to confirm
       that trend.
      Central to the study of salary and benefits is understanding the respondents’
       perception of the economic conditions of their districts. Regardless of gender and
       consistent with previous findings, half of the superintendents described their
       district as stable while nearly four in 10 described their districts as in declining
       economic condition. It is noted that, while not dramatic, the trend over the three
       years of the study suggests an improving economic condition.
   When considering gender and the perceived economic condition of their district,
    female superintendents tend to lead districts with greater economic challenges
    than do their male counterparts.
   As in the previous year’s results, white (not Hispanic) superintendents
    represented a majority of those responding to the survey which is consistent with
    the findings of The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study as well as
    findings from the 2012 study. Note: As indicated in the introduction, care should
    be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences from the very small numbers
    of respondents in some of the racial/cultural groups other than the fact that
    white (non-Hispanic) superintendents are the largest group represented in the
    study and minorities appear to be underrepresented in the superintendent ranks
    especially when compared to the racial/cultural profile of American public
    school enrollment.
   Again as was true in the racial/cultural group reporting by enrollment, when
    asked how they characterize their district, African American superintendent
    respondents trended toward employment in larger districts in greater percentage
    than white respondents. Provided the small numbers of other racial/cultural
    group respondents make it very difficult to draw any conclusions from the data.
   As with longevity in their present position, white respondents tended to have
    increased longevity in the role of superintendent.
   When investigating the racial/cultural group and the respondents’ description of
    the economic conditions of their districts, a greater percentage of minority
    superintendents find themselves in districts of declining economic conditions
    compared to white superintendents.
   Salaries ranged from $36,000 to $315,000, with an average salary of $122,000 and
    a median salary of $113,000.
   As expected, throughout the entire term of the study, the median salary of
    superintendents increases with district enrollment. This growth almost triples
    when the median salary for the smallest district is compared to the largest
    enrollment district.
   In most, but not all cases, across district enrollments, median salaries paid to
    females is somewhat higher than that paid to male superintendents until
    examining the largest districts, where the salaries equalize. In drawing
    conclusions from these data, one must take into consideration the relatively small
    number of respondents in the smallest and largest districts.
   As with the superintendent base salaries, assistant/associate superintendents’
    median base salaries increase with district enrollment, while the smallest of
    districts have few individuals serving in this capacity, thereby making
    comparison difficult.
   As with the superintendent base salaries, high school principal median base
    salaries increase with district enrollment.
   As with the superintendent base salaries, middle school principal median base
    salaries increase with district enrollment, while the smallest of districts have few
    individual serving in this capacity thereby making comparison difficult.
   As with the superintendent base salaries, elementary school principal median
    base salaries increase with district enrollment, while the smallest of districts have
    few individual serving in this capacity thereby making comparison difficult.
   As with the superintendent base salaries, teacher median base salaries increase
    with district enrollment.
   Annual performance evaluations occur in over 93 percent of all reporting school
    districts. This occurs more than other performance evaluation intervals by a ratio
    of 9:1.
   Only half of the respondent superintendents indicate that they have included in
    the evaluation process, measures and indicators to be used in the formal
    evaluation in their employment agreement. In fact, the percentage decreased
    slightly from 2013-14 to 2014-15.
   Linking objectives and directions from previous evaluations with the present
    evaluation occurs in slightly more than half of the evaluations of
    superintendents.
   Only one in six superintendent evaluations employs 360 degree feedback. No
    discernable change occurred in this item from the previous year.
   Somewhat less than four in 10 superintendents indicated that student
    outcomes/performance data are included in their evaluations. This percentage
    decreased somewhat from 2013-14 to 2014-15.
   The public release of the formal evaluation of the superintendent has increased
    slightly from 34.6 percent in 2012-13 to 35.1 percent in 2013-14.
   Slightly more than 30 percent of the superintendents responding to the survey
    indicated they receive a district contribution to an annuity or private retirement
    account.
   Respondents in districts making higher contributions to annuities or private
    retirement accounts had higher salaries than those with no or small district
    contributions. In this case, a lower salary is not being offset by increased annuity
    benefits.
   Nearly nine out of 10 of the respondents indicated that the district contribution
    to the retirement plan/system was based on salary.
   The medical/hospital coverage of superintendents has reduced slightly from 77.6
    percent in 2013-14 to 75.6 percent in 2014-15.
   Dental coverage decreased by 4 percent in the last year which matched the same
    decrease over the previous year.
   As with dental coverage, vision/optical coverage decreased by 2 percent over the
    last year.
   Reversing the trend of decreases in some sectors of insurance coverage, the
    provision of disability coverage grew slightly over the last year, nearing half of
    the responding superintendents receiving disability coverage.
   Six out of 10 families of superintendents, who responded to the survey are
    covered by medical/hospital insurance paid by the district. This represents a 5
    percent increase over the previous year.
   District-paid dental coverage for the superintendent’s family is reported much
    less than coverage over medical/hospitalization.
   Less than one in three families of superintendents who responded receive
    district-paid vision/optical coverage in 2013-14 while present percentages
    higher.
   Although only about one in five superintendent families are covered by a
    district-paid disability policy in 2014-15, this marks an increase over previous
    years.
   The issue of post-retirement insurance coverage is an important matter for
    district leaders. In the 2012-13 study, 17.6 percent of the respondents reported
    having post-retirement health coverage in their employment agreement. Last
    year 28.1 percent reported having that benefit. Reversing this trend, only 23.0
    percent enjoyed this benefit in 2014-15.
   Less than one in 10 superintendents who responded indicated that they have
    been rehired as a superintendent after retiring from that state's or another state's
    retirement system.
   When compared to the responses from a year earlier, change in participation in
    benefits was not markedly different. Worth noting is a slight increase in the use
    of deferred compensation and payment of professional liability insurance over
    the past two years.
   Nearly half of the responding superintendents reported receiving a district-paid
    insurance policy above that received by other district employees. This parallels
    past responses to this item.
   When examining sick leave allowance accrual, vacation and personal leave, there
    is no distinguishing difference when comparing by gender.
   Regardless of gender, less than 50 percent of superintendents who responded
    reported leveraging their sick leave into payments and one in three into
    retirement credits upon their departure from the district. This represents little or
    no change from the previous year.
   Not unlike sick leave, leveraging vacation leave into a payment is occurring only
    in about half of reporting districts, while credit toward retirement accounts is
    limited.
   Credit or payment for personal leave upon departure is very limited and has
    changed very little since the last survey.
   Regardless of gender, three year contracts represent the largest percentage of
    contracts offered to superintendents.
   Incentive provisions in contracts when compared by gender show only about
    one in six superintendents with such a provision in their contract. The year over
    year comparison show small increases in this provision in the contracts of female
    superintendents.
   As in the previous year, a little more than 20 percent of males and 25 percent of
    females have a severance clause in their employment agreement. This represents
    a slight increase year over year is recognized.
   Compared to limited inclusion of a severance clause, longevity clauses are even
    less common, with somewhat less than one in 10 including such a provision
    regardless of gender.
   While relatively few salary caps are reported as impacting superintendents, it is
    notable that nearly twice as many female superintendents than male
    superintendents report a cap imposed by state law.
   Less than one in three superintendents have a rollover provision.
   Discounting some of the small number of respondents by racial/cultural group,
    there is little variance in the term of employment agreement.
   Consistent with similar disaggregation of the data, the presence of
    incentive/performance clauses appear in slightly more than one in 10 contracts.
   Where sufficient number of respondents exists, about a quarter of superintendent
    respondents in each racial/cultural group had a severance provision which
    represents little change from the previous year survey.
   As with the severance provision, less than 10 percent of the superintendent
    respondents have a longevity clause regardless of race/ethnicity.
   Regardless of race/ethnicity, salary caps occur about 10 percent of the time.
   Where sufficient numbers of respondent superintendents exist and viewed by
    racial/ethnic group, the presence of an evergreen provision occurred in less than
    one in three contracts.
   Slightly less than half of the respondent superintendents indicated that the
    district used a legal counsel to negotiate the superintendent’s employment
    agreement.
   In contrast to the use of legal counsel by the district, only about a quarter of
    respondent superintendents use the services of legal counsel to negotiate their
    own employment agreement. There is no change in this figure from previous
    years.
   Overwhelmingly districts support professional memberships for the
    superintendent.

Findings:
    A total of 1,711 usable responses were received for the 2014 study or slightly more
      than 19 percent of those contacted. This return represents a reduction by
      approximately 6 percent over 2013 returns but a significant increase over 2012 return
      rates. This response rate seems to suggest a strong interest on the part of
      superintendents for the collection and analysis of salary and benefits data.
    All states were represented. No state appears to be overrepresented.

Findings:
    Similar to the previous studies, respondents arrayed by gender favor males over
      females in a slightly more than three to one ratio which is consistent to the
      respondents in The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study. It is also
      noted that female participation fell by approximately 2 percent over previous levels
      while male participation grew by the same amount.
    Whites (non-Hispanic) dominate the respondent ranks regardless of the gender.
    As noted in the introduction, weak minority participation in several groups makes it
      difficult to generalize for those groups from the findings.

Finding:
    When gender and district enrollment of respondents are taken into account, the
      majority of superintendents participating in the survey were from intermediate size
      districts (300-2,499), regardless of gender.

Finding:
    When asked to describe the setting of their district, more than 70 percent of the
      respondents, regardless of gender, indicated that their district was best described as
      rural while about a fifth describe their district as suburban. This represents an increase
      in rural respondents and decrease in suburban and urban response levels.

    Note: 13 respondents omitted gender.

Finding:
    In a new item to the annual survey, respondents were asked their age. As a
      confirmation of that found in The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study,
      females were found to be older than their male counterparts in both mean and median
      data.

Findings:
    When asked about their longevity in their present position, nearly half indicated one to
      five years with longer longevity favoring males.
    When compared with the 2013 results, a small trend toward longer longevity was
      indicated. Additional data points would have to be established to confirm that trend.

Findings:
    When asked about their longevity as a superintendent, males trended toward longer
      longevity in the superintendent position than females.
    As in the previous item, when compared with the 2013 results, a small trend toward
      longer longevity was indicated. Likewise, additional data points would have to be

Findings:
    Central to the study of salary and benefits is understanding the respondents’
      perception of the economic conditions of their districts. Regardless of gender and
      consistent with previous findings, half of the superintendents described their districts
      as stable while nearly four in 10 described their districts as in declining economic
      condition. It is noted that, while not dramatic, the trend over the three years of the
      study suggests an improving economic condition.
    When considering gender and the perceived economic condition of their district,
      female superintendents tend to lead districts with greater economic challenges than
      do their male counterparts.

Findings:

      As in the previous year’s results, white (non-Hispanic) superintendents represented a
       majority of those responding to the survey which is consistent with the findings of The
       American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study as well as findings from the 2012
       study. Note: As indicated in the introduction, care should be exercised in drawing
       conclusions or inferences from the very small numbers of respondents in some of the
       racial/cultural groups other than the fact that white (non Hispanic) superintendents
       are the largest group represented in the study and minorities appear to be
       underrepresented in the superintendent ranks especially when compared to the
       racial/cultural profile of American public school enrollment.

Finding:
    Again as was true in the racial/cultural group reporting by enrollment, when asked
      how they characterize their districts, African American superintendent respondents
      trended toward employment in larger districts in greater percentage than white
      respondents. Provided the small numbers of other racial/cultural group respondents
      makes it very difficult to draw any conclusions from the data.

Finding:
    When investigating the racial/cultural group and the respondents’ description of the
      economic condition of their district, a greater percentage of superintendents of color
      find themselves in districts of declining economic condition when compared to white
      superintendents.
                                   SECTION #2: SALARY

NOTE: A significant amount of information follows concerning salaries paid to the
superintendents and their staff. For the purposes of comparisons, ratios have been calculated
for median superintendent salaries and that of teachers (See Table 2.3). The logic employed is
that in the private sector, a commonly used metric (ratio) is calculated based on the base
salary of the CEO and that of the entry-level worker in the organization. Without great
difficulty, other metrics can be calculated using these data presented herein.

Findings:
    Overall, salaries ranged from $36,000 to $315,000, with an average salary of $122,000
      and a median salary of $113,000.
    As expected, throughout the entire term of the study, the median salary of
      superintendents increases with district enrollment. This growth almost triples when
      the median salary for the smallest district is compared to the largest enrollment
      district.
    In most, but not all cases, across district enrollments, median salaries paid to females
      is somewhat higher than that paid to male superintendents until examining largest
      districts, where the salaries equalize. In drawing conclusions from these data, one
      must take into consideration the relatively small number of respondents in the
      smallest and largest districts.
    When compared to previous studies, there appears to be some movement up in
      median salaries with the largest increases enjoyed by superintendents in the largest
      districts.

Finding:
    Regardless of gender, less than half of superintendents who responded reported
      leveraging their sick leave into payments and one in three into retirement credits
      upon their departure from the district. This represents little or no change from the
      previous year.

Finding:
    Incentive provisions in contracts when compared by gender show only about one in
      six superintendents with such a provision in their contract. The year after year
      comparison shows small increases in this provision in the contracts of female
      superintendents.

Finding:
    As in the previous year, a little more than 20 percent of males and 25 percent of
      females have a severance clause in their employment agreement. While slight, the
      increase over the previous year.


Table 7.12 Gender (Q43) and Does your contract have a longevity clause (i.e., a lump sum

Finding:
    Compared to limited inclusion of a severance clause, longevity clauses are even less
      common, with somewhat less than one in 10 including such a provision regardless of
      gender.

Finding:
    While relatively few salary caps are reported as impacting superintendents, it is
      notable that nearly twice as many female superintendents than male superintendents
      report a cap imposed by state law.
