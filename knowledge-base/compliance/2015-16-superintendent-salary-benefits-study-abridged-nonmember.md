EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

    The 2015 AASA Superintendents Salary & Benefits Study marks the fourth edition of
this study. This survey tracks the demographics, salary, benefits and other elements of
the employment contracts of school superintendents throughout the country. This
year’s study is based on 728 responses, a 5.6 percent return rate. This is lower than
previous years, and does lead to some limitations in drawing conclusions from the
findings. However, the report is rich with information and serves as a useful snapshot
of the superintendency. For a more detailed examination of the superintendency, be
sure to read the Study of the American Superintendent: 2015 Mid-Decade Update, available
at my.aasa.org.

This year, as in the last four years, nearly 70 percent of respondents reported that they
work in rural districts. This is close to the U.S. Department of Education data, which
found that 57 percent of districts were defined as rural in 2010-11.1 Black and
Hispanic/Latino respondents serve in suburban and urban districts more than their
counterparts.

Also consistent with findings of the previous years, male respondents outnumbered
females by a four to one ratio. Respondents were also overwhelmingly White (non-
Hispanic). Female respondents also tended to be older than males. The average and
median age of all respondents was 53.

The median salary was $131,000, average was $140,021, which both increased around 15
percent from 2014. It is important to note the smaller sample size in this study before
making conclusions. All positions from superintendent to teacher show that salaries
increase relative to district enrollment size.

This year, respondents report an increase in many benefits, including contribution to
annuity or private retirement plan, medical/hospital coverage, dental coverage, vision
coverage, disability insurance and medical and dental insurance coverage for the family
of the superintendent. Districts also overwhelmingly support professional memberships
– this year showed a marked increase in payment of national organization membership.

In superintendent contracts, the most common contract length was three years, with
few contracts lasting more than three years. Severance clauses have become more
common over the years – this year, 25 percent of respondents have one. Salary caps,
while mentioned often in the press, are not common in superintendent contracts. Only 6
percent have one, with over half of those required by state law.

This year also showed a 10 percent increase in boards’ use of legal counsel in
developing or negotiating contract – 60 percent do so. Superintendent use of legal
counsel is also increasing, but still lags far behind at 25 percent.

INTRODUCTION

The 2015 AASA Superintendents Salary and Benefits Study is intended to provide
superintendents with actionable information needed to manage their compensation.
This edition marks the fourth year the association has undertaken a comprehensive
study on public school superintendent compensation. Prior to that, most school
superintendents had to rely on the annual salary study sponsored by Education
Research Service (ERS) to benchmark their compensation and benefits. With the closure
of ERS, a void was created for such data. AASA responded to this need by creating a
comprehensive study of the salary and benefits of school superintendents that far
exceeded previous studies undertaken on this topic. AASA is particularly well-suited
for this task because it represents the vast majority of school superintendents in the
country and has been most active in collecting and disseminating to its members critical
data needed to inform decision making. AASA is committed to refining this work over
time, thus maximizing the benefit to superintendents. The preceding editions of this
study are available on the AASA website and provide valuable retrospective data.

This work complements The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study
(Kowalski et al. 2010), also sponsored by AASA, and available from Roman & Littlefield
(https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781607099963).

The research team authoring this report of findings was led by Leslie A. Finnan, AASA
senior legislative analyst and Noelle Ellerson, AASA associate executive director, policy
and advocacy. The research team was assisted in review by Robert S. McCord, AASA
consultant, Christopher C. Stream, associate professor of the School of Environmental
and Public Affairs, University of Nevada, Las Vegas and by George J. Petersen,
founding dean, Eugene T. Moore School of Education, Clemson University.


METHODOLOGY

An extensive survey instrument was developed in 2012 and with the assistance of
Professors Theodore J. Kowalski (University of Dayton), I. Phillip Young (University of
South Carolina), Terry Orr (Bank Street College), and Christopher C. Stream (University
of Nevada, Las Vegas). This survey instrument was further refined for use in 2015 as a
result of input received from superintendents participating in the 2012 - 2014 studies.
Using a commercially prepared mailing list of American public school superintendents,
more than 9,000 email invitations to participate were distributed during the month of
September 2015. At the same time, state association executive directors were contacted
to encourage their members to respond to the Internet survey. Superintendents had the
capacity to forward the link to their staff members for input in completing the survey in

                                             iii
their area of expertise. The response to the 2012 study numbered 1,280 or about 14
percent, while the number of superintendents responding to the 2013 study nearly
doubled to 2,369 or more than 25 percent. The 2014 survey resulted in 1,711 responses,
or about 19 percent of those surveyed. In 2015 at total of 728 usable responses were
received. This precipitous erosion in the return rate suggests survey fatigue linked with
the need to audit the vendor-provided listing.

REPORT OF FINDINGS

This report of findings is divided into 9 sections and solely relies on measures of central
tendency for this analysis of the data collected. These data were generally
disaggregated by gender, district enrollment and racial/ethnic group.

As with any ambitious effort of this sort, there are limitations on the proper use of the
data. For example, when the responses for certain items were disaggregated by
racial/ethnic group, the number of responses was insufficient to support decision
making. Care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences on this
particular data element. In addition, survey fatigue is apparent among superintendents
and impacted the return rate. Superintendents are inundated with research requests
resulting in selective participation in those studies seen as most important to the role of
the superintendent or of benefit to their district. While retreating significantly in the
2015 study, the dramatic growth in the 2013 response rate over that received in 2012 is
an indication of the importance superintendents place on collecting these data, while
the 2015 estimated participation rate of 5.6 percent is far less than is desired and
reasonably raises questions of whether the data fairly represents the entire population
thus limiting the application of more comprehensive statistical treatment.

Having clearly identified the limitations inherent in any endeavor of this sort, the report
that follows is rich with information that can prove useful to superintendents.

Findings:
      A total of 728 usable responses were received which represents approximately 5.6
        percent return rate which a substantial erosion in response rate and signals the need
        to revisit the methodology to return to a more acceptable response rate.
      All states except Hawaii, including the District of Columbia, were represented. No
        state appears to be overrepresented.

Findings:
    Similar to previous studies, males outnumbered females by a four to one ratio.

    Weak minority participation in several groups makes it difficult to generalize for
      those groups from the findings.

Finding:
    When gender and district enrollment of respondents are taken into account, the
      majority of superintendents participating in the survey were from intermediate size
      districts (300-2,499), regardless of gender.

Finding:
    When asked to describe the setting of their district, nearly 70 percent of the
      respondents, regardless of gender, indicated that their district was best described as
      rural while about a fourth describe their district as suburban. This represents a small
      decrease in rural respondents and equally small increase in suburban response level.

Findings:
      When asked about their longevity as a superintendent, males also trended toward
        longer longevity in the superintendency than females.
      As in the previous item, when compared with the 2013 and 2014 results, a small
        trend toward longer longevity as a superintendent was indicated.

Findings:
    More than half of the male superintendents and somewhat more than 40 percent of
      the female superintendents described their districts as economically stable while
      nearly 40 percent of both genders described their districts as in declining economic
      condition. It is noted that, while not dramatic, the trend over the four years of the
      study suggests an improving economic condition.


                                                         4
      When considering gender and the perceived economic condition of their district,
       female superintendents tend to self-report leading districts with greater economic
       challenges than do their male counterparts.

Finding:
      As in the previous results, white (non-Hispanic) superintendents represented the
         vast majority of superintendents regardless of student enrollment which is
         consistent with the findings of The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial
         Study as well as findings from the 2012, 2013, and 2014 salary studies. Note: As
         indicated in the introduction, care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or
         inferences from the very small numbers of respondents in some of the
         racial/cultural groups other than the fact that white (non-Hispanic) superintendents
         are the largest group represented in the study and minorities appear to be



                                                        5
         underrepresented in the superintendent ranks especially when compared to the
         racial/cultural profile of American public school enrollment.

Finding:
    Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino respondents reported serving in larger
      percentage in suburban and urban districts than their counterparts. Provided the
      small numbers of other racial/cultural group respondents makes it very difficult to
      draw conclusions from the data.

Finding:
    When the number of respondents is considered, not a great variation was found
      between the mean or median age of those responding when disaggregated by
      racial/cultural group.

Finding:

      Half of superintendents have served in their present position for from 1-5 years. A

         more than a quarter reported 6-10 years.

Finding:
      When superintendent self-reported the economic condition of their district, slightly
         more than half indicated that their district was in stable condition regardless of the
         racial/cultural identity of the superintendent. Reports of declining economic
         conditions occurred in a third of the districts.

                                 SECTION #2: SALARY

NOTE: A significant amount of information follows concerning salaries paid to the
superintendents and their staff. For the purposes of comparisons, ratios have been calculated
for median superintendent salaries and that of teachers (See Table 2.3). The logic employed is
that in the private sector, a commonly used metric (ratio) is calculated based on the base
salary of the CEO and that of the entry-level worker in the organization. Without great
difficulty, other metrics can be calculated using these data presented herein.

Findings:
      As previously reported, the limited response rate by gender in the largest student enrollment
        districts makes it difficult to identify trends, while in intermediate size districts the mean
        base salary for females outpaces that of their male counterparts.
      The median salary was $131,000 and the average was $140,021.

Finding:
      As expected, the larger the student enrollment of the district the higher the mean
         base salary for assistant/associate superintendents. Of course in the smallest of
         districts, these positions often do not exist.

Finding:
      An important metric often calculated in the business community is the ratio of the
         entry level worker compensation with that of the CEO. Accordingly, the median
         entry level salary of teachers was compared with the median salary of the
         superintendents arrayed by district size. The data suggests that as the district
         enrollment increases so does the ratio. In addition, the ratio appears to widen over
         the past two survey periods regardless of the district enrollment, although
         additional data will need to be collected to establish a trend.

Finding:
              This table examines if some districts offset lower salaries with greater benefits. In the case
               of contribution to retirement, this is not the case. Superintendents receiving higher
               contributions to retirement also, on average, receive higher salaries than their
               counterparts.

Finding:
      The issue of post-retirement insurance coverage is an important matter for district
         leaders. In the 2012-13 study, 17.6 percent of the respondents reported having post-
         retirement health coverage in their employment agreement. In 2013-14 28.1 percent
         reported having that benefit. Reversing this trend, only 23.0 percent enjoyed this
         benefit in 2014-15. Again reversing the trend, 27.3 percent of 2015-16 survey
         respondents reported receiving the benefit.

Finding:
      Regardless of gender, less than half of superintendents who responded reported
         leveraging their sick leave into payments to the superintendent upon their departure
         from the district. In a departure from the previous year survey almost no
         superintendent benefited from payments to retirement credit for unused sick upon
         departure from the district.

      common, with one in ten male superintendents and slightly more female
      superintendents including this provision in their employment agreements.

    Consistent with similar disaggregation of the data, the presence of
      incentive/performance clauses appear in slightly more than one in 6 contracts which
