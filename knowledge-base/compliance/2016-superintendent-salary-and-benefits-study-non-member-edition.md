2016 AASA SUPERINTENDENT SALARY & BENEFITS STUDY

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2016 AASA Superintendent Salary & Benefits Study marks the fifth edition of this
study. This survey tracks the demographics, salary, benefits, and other elements of the
employment contracts of school superintendents throughout the country. This year’s
study is based on 1,392 responses (15 percent response rate). The survey was distributed
online and relied on superintendents to respond to 47 items with the understanding
that report of findings would contain no personally identifiable information.
Consequently, data must be considered descriptive and not necessarily representative
of all superintendents. However, the report is rich with information and serves as a
useful snapshot of the salary and benefits of superintendents for the 2016-17 school
year. For a more detailed examination of the superintendency, The Study of the American
Superintendent: 2015 Mid-Decade Update and its 2010 predecessor are available at:
(http://my.aasa.org/AASA/Toolbox/Policy_and_Advocacy_Resources/AASA/Toolb
ox/Policy_Advocacy_Resources.aspx). In addition, state-specific model superintendent
employment agreements are also available on the AASA website
(http://my.aasa.org/AASA/Toolbox/Other_Resources/Model_Contracts.aspx).

This year, as in the past four years, more than 90 percent of respondents reported that
they served in suburban and rural districts with nearly 70 percent of respondents self-
reported serving in rural districts. This is generally representative of the distribution of
school districts nationwide.

Consistent with findings of the previous years, male respondents outnumbered females
by a four-to-one ratio. Respondents were also overwhelmingly White (non Hispanic).
Female respondents also tended to be somewhat older than their male counterparts.
The average and median age of all respondents was 52.

The median salary distributed by district enrollment ranged from just $90,000 for the
smallest districts to nearly $230,000 for superintendents serving in the largest
enrollment school districts. Overall, the median salary was $130,683. All positions from
superintendent to teacher show that salaries increase relative to district enrollment size
as well as slight increases over previous years.

The report of findings profiles the benefits received by superintendents, including, but
not limited to contribution to annuities or private retirement plans, medical/hospital
coverage, dental coverage, vision coverage, disability insurance, and medical and dental
insurance coverage for the family of the superintendent. Respondents also
overwhelmingly support professional memberships.
INTRODUCTION

The 2016 AASA Superintendents Salary and Benefits Study is intended to provide
superintendents with actionable information needed to manage and negotiate their
compensation and benefits. This edition marks the fifth year the association has
undertaken a comprehensive study on public school superintendent compensation
benefits. Prior to that, most school superintendents relied on the annual salary study
sponsored by Education Research Service (ERS) to benchmark their compensation and
benefits. With the closure of ERS, a void was created. AASA responded to this need by
creating a comprehensive study of the salary and benefits of school superintendents
that far exceeded previous studies undertaken on this topic. AASA is particularly well-
suited for this task because it represents the vast majority of school superintendents in
the country and has been most active in collecting and disseminating to its members
critical data needed to inform decision making. AASA is committed to refining this
work over time, thus maximizing the benefit to superintendents.

The earlier editions of this study are available on the AASA website and provide
valuable retrospective data (http://www.aasa.org/research.aspx).

This work complements The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study
(Kowalski et al. 2010), also sponsored by AASA, and available from Roman & Littlefield
(https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781607099963). This study was updated in 2015 and is
available on the AASA website (http://www.aasa.org/research.aspx).

The research team authoring this report of findings was led by Leslie A. Finnan, AASA
senior legislative analyst and Robert S. McCord, AASA research consultant.

METHODOLOGY
An extensive survey instrument was developed in 2012 with the assistance of Professors
Theodore J. Kowalski (University of Dayton), I. Phillip Young (University of South
Carolina), Terry Orr (Bank Street College), and Christopher C. Stream (University of
Nevada, Las Vegas). This survey instrument was further refined for use in each
subsequent year as a result of input received. Using a commercially prepared mailing
list of American public school superintendents, more than 9,000 email invitations to
participate were distributed during the month of September 2016. At the same time,
state association executive directors were contacted to encourage their members to
respond to the online survey. Superintendents had the capacity to forward the link to
their staff members for input in completing the survey in their area of expertise.
REPORT OF FINDINGS
This report of findings is divided into 11 sections and solely relies on measures of
central tendency for this analysis of the data collected. These data were generally
disaggregated by gender, district enrollment, and racial/ethnic group.

As with any ambitious effort of this sort, there are limitations on the proper use of the
data. For example, when the responses for certain items were disaggregated by
racial/ethnic group, the number of responses was insufficient to support decision
making. Care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences on this
particular data element. In addition, some survey fatigue is commonly reported by
superintendents and could have impacted the return rate. Superintendents are
inundated with research requests resulting in selective participation in those studies
seen as most important to the role of the superintendent or of benefit to their district.
After each data display, the report authors have offered a general statement of findings.
It is the intent of the authors to allow the reader the opportunity to disaggregate the
data in a manner they find useful in working with their board.

Having clearly identified the limitations inherent in any endeavor of this sort, the report
that follows is replete with important information that can prove very useful to
superintendents.

END NOTES:
Many additional data elements were collected beyond those reported in this document.

Findings:
    A total of 1,392 usable responses were received, representing an approximately 15
      percent return rate. This return represents a substantial increase from that received in
      2015 response (N=728).
    All states except Hawaii (including the District of Columbia) were represented
      including one international response. No state appears to be overrepresented.

Findings:
    Similar to previous studies, males outnumbered females by a four-to-one ratio, though
      this year’s response represents greater participation by female superintendents than
      generally previous years.
    Respondents were overwhelmingly white (non Hispanic) at 91.9 percent.
    Small numbers of minority superintendent respondents make findings for those groups
      difficult. However, this year’s minority response was greater than in previous years.

       from intermediate size districts (300-2,499 students).

Finding:
    When asked to describe the setting of their district, nearly 70 percent of the
      respondents, regardless of gender, indicated that their district was best described as
      rural while about a fourth describe their district as suburban. This is closely aligned
      with data from the National Center on Education Statistics1.

Finding:
    Consistent with earlier versions of the study, the mean age for female superintendents
      is greater than their male counterparts. This supports the findings of other AASA
      studies of the superintendency where females tend to enter the role later and have
      greater experience in the roles leading to assuming a superintendency.

Finding:
    Males report somewhat longer longevity in the superintendency than females
      although the longevity of female superintendents has increased substantially as
      evidenced by earlier editions of this study and that of The American School
      Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study.

Finding:
    In 2015, more than half of the male superintendents and somewhat more than 40
      percent of the female superintendents described their districts as economically stable
      while nearly 36 percent of both genders described their districts as in declining
      economic condition. Not much has changed since the last study, save one item: female
      superintendents report serving in districts with somewhat improved economic
      conditions over what was reported the year before. It is noted that, while not
      dramatic, the trend over the five years of the study suggests an improving economic
      condition in American school districts.

Finding:
    As in the previously reported, white (non Hispanic) superintendents represented the
      vast majority of superintendents responding to the study regardless of student
      enrollment, which is consistent with the findings of The American School
      Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study as well as findings from the 2012, 2013, 2014, and
      2015 salary studies. Note: As indicated in the introduction, care should be exercised in
      drawing conclusions or inferences from the very small numbers of respondents in
      some of the racial/cultural groups, other than the fact that white (non Hispanic)
      superintendents are the largest group represented in the study and minorities appear
      to be underrepresented in the superintendent ranks, especially when compared to the
      racial/cultural profile of American public school student and teacher population.

Finding:
    Considering the small number of other racial/cultural group respondents, it makes it
      very difficult to draw conclusions from these data, although the absence of diversity
      in urban districts represents an anomaly when one considers the diversity of the
      student population generally understood to be enrolled in urban districts.

Finding:
    When the number of respondents is considered, not a great variation was found
      between the mean or median age of those responding when disaggregated by
      racial/cultural group. This is consistent with previous editions of this study.

Findings:
    Half of superintendents have served in their present position from 1-5 years. A
      quarter of superintendents have served from 6-10 years. While small increases in
      tenure was found, those increases are consistent over the term of these studies.
    The number of minority respondents is too small to identify any trends.

Finding:
    While the numbers were small for some racial/cultural groups, one-third of
      superintendents reported serving in the superintendency for 1-5 years; a little more
      than a quarter reported 6-10 years.

Finding:
    When superintendents self-reported the economic condition of their district, slightly
      more than half indicated that their district was in stable condition regardless of the
      racial/cultural identity of the superintendent. Reports of declining economic
      conditions occurred in a third of the districts.

                                     SECTION #2: SALARY

NOTE: A significant amount of information follows concerning salaries paid to
superintendents and their staff. For the purposes of comparisons, ratios have been calculated
for median superintendent salaries and that of teachers (see Table 2.3). The logic employed is
that in the private sector, a commonly used metric (ratio) is calculated based on the base
salary of the CEO and that of the entry-level worker in the organization.

Findings:
    As previously reported, the limited response rate by gender in the largest student
      enrollment districts makes it difficult to identify trends, while comparison by gender
      of superintendent salaries suggests that the salaries of male and female
      superintendents are nearly equal across enrollment categories.
    Consistent with previous years, salaries increase as district enrollment increases.
    The average salary across all district enrollment groups was $139,470.

Findings:
    As experienced in previous editions of the study, the larger the student enrollment of
      the district the higher the mean base salary for assistant/associate superintendents. Of
      course in the smallest of districts, these positions often do not exist.
    A small but consistent increase in median salaries is seen over previous editions of
      this study.

Finding:
    An important metric often calculated in the private sector is the ratio of the entry level
      worker compensation with that of the CEO. Accordingly, the median entry level
      salary of teachers was compared with the median salary of the superintendents
      arrayed by district size. The data confirms that as the district enrollment increases so
      does the ratio. In addition, the ratio has appeared to widen over the past three survey
      periods regardless of the district enrollment. What remains to be investigated is the
      impact of teacher shortage on the ratios in the future.

Finding:
   Somewhat more than half of the families of superintendents who responded to the
      survey are covered by medical/hospital insurance paid by the district. This represents

Finding:
    The issue of post-retirement insurance coverage is an important matter for district
      leaders. In the 2012-13 study, 17.6 percent of the respondents reported having post-
      retirement health coverage in their employment agreement. In 2013-14 28.1 percent
      reported having that benefit. Reversing this trend, only 23.0 percent received this
      benefit in 2014-15. Again reversing the trend, 27.3 percent of 2015-16 survey
      respondents reported receiving the benefit.

Finding:
    Only about one in six superintendents have an incentive provision in their contract.

Finding:
    A little less than a quarter of superintendents, regardless of gender, report having a
      severance clause in their employment agreement. Inclusion of a severance clause has
      become more common over the years.

      as impacting superintendents. However, several states are considering implementing
      them in the next years.

Finding:
      Where sufficient numbers of respondent superintendents exist, viewed by
         racial/ethnic group, the presence of an evergreen provision occurred in about one in
         three contracts. No significant change is reported from previous surveys.

Finding:
    Nearly six in 10 boards use legal counsel in the development and/or negotiation of
      contracts. While lower than last year’s findings, this shows an increase from the first
      iterations of this study.

Finding:
    Consistent with the increased use of legal counsel by boards, superintendents report
      their own increased use of legal counsel, while not nearly as dramatic as that of
      boards.

              Administrators)
Note: Multiple answers per participant possible. Percentages added may exceed 100 as a participant may select
more than one answer for this question.

Finding:
    Overwhelmingly districts support professional memberships for the superintendent.
      Most dramatic is the increase in payment of national organization membership.
