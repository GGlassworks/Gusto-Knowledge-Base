EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2019–20 AASA Superintendent Salary & Benefits Study marks the eighth edition of
this study, employing an annually revised and updated survey instrument. This survey
tracks the demographics, salary, benefits, and other elements of the employment
agreements of school superintendents throughout the country. This year’s study is based
on more than 1,300 responses (approximately a 13 percent response rate). The survey was
distributed online and relied on superintendents responding to 55 items with the
understanding that the report of findings would contain no personally identifiable
information. Consequently, data must be considered descriptive and not necessarily
representative of all superintendents. The study is intended to provide superintendents
with actionable information needed to manage and negotiate their compensation and
benefits. Prior to the AASA efforts to study this topic, most school superintendents relied
on the annual salary study sponsored by the Education Research Service (ERS) to
benchmark their compensation and benefits. With the closure of ERS nearly a decade ago,
a void was created. AASA responded to this need by developing a comprehensive study
of the salary and benefits of school superintendents that far exceeded previous studies
undertaken on this topic. AASA is particularly well suited for this task because it
represents the vast majority of school superintendents in the country and has been most
active in collecting and disseminating to its members critical data needed to inform
decision making. AASA is committed to refining this work over time, thus maximizing
the benefit to superintendents. Finally, while significant effort was placed on producing
a high response rate for this annual survey, the response rate among superintendents in
school districts enrolling less than 300 students was insufficient to meet a fair standard of
representation and therefore were eliminated from reporting.

The earlier editions of this study are available on the AASA website and provide valuable
retrospective data (http://www.aasa.org/research.aspx). This work complements The
American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study (Kowalski et al., 2010), also
sponsored      by     AASA,       and     available     from   Roman      &    Littlefield
(https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781607099963). That study was updated in 2015 and is
available on the AASA website (http://www.aasa.org/research.aspx). Pending release
in early 2020 is The American School Superintendent: 2020 Decennial Study edited by
Professor Christopher Tienken from Seton Hall University and sponsored by AASA in
conjunction with Phi Delta Kappa.

In addition, there is an inevitable comparison between public and private sector COEs.
Useful in this discussion is the work of The New York Times in its ongoing series on private
sector CEO compensation and its relationship to median employee pay
(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/business/highest-paid-ceos-2017.html).

METHODOLOGY
An extensive survey instrument was first developed in 2012 with the assistance of
Professors Theodore J. Kowalski (University of Dayton), I. Phillip Young (University of
South Carolina), Terry Orr (Bank Street College), and Christopher C. Stream (University
of Nevada, Las Vegas). This survey instrument was further refined for use in subsequent
years as a result of input received. Using a commercially prepared mailing list of
American public-school superintendents, more than 9,000 email invitations to participate
were distributed during the month of September and October 2019. At the same time,
state association executive directors were contacted to encourage their members to
respond to the online survey.

Christian Rogers, AASA legislative analyst, led the research team authoring this report
of findings, with assistance from Robert S. McCord, AASA research consultant. The
research was conducted under the direct supervision of Noelle Ellerson Ng, AASA
Associate Executive Director, Policy and Advocacy, and Sasha Pudelski, Assistant
Director, Policy, and Advocacy.

REPORT OF FINDINGS
This report of findings is divided into 11 sections and relies solely on measures of central
tendency for this analysis of the data collected. These data are generally disaggregated
by gender, district enrollment, and racial/ethnic group.

As with any ambitious effort of this sort, there are limitations on the proper use of the
data. For example, when the responses for certain items are disaggregated by
racial/ethnic group, the number of responses may be insufficient to support decision
making. Care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences on this data
element. In addition, some survey fatigue is commonly reported by superintendents and
could have impacted the return rate. Superintendents are inundated with research
requests resulting in selective participation in those studies seen as most important to the
role of the superintendent or of benefit to their district. After each data display, the report
authors have offered a general statement of findings. It is the intent of the authors to allow
the readers the opportunity to disaggregate the data in a manner they find useful in
working with their board.

Having clearly identified the limitations inherent in any endeavor of this sort, the report
that follows is replete with important information that can prove very useful to
superintendents.

Finding:
•   Consistent with nationwide school district enrollment data, the majority of superintendents
    responding to the survey are from small and intermediate size districts (300–2,999 students)
    with no recent appreciable difference by gender of superintendents serving in each
    enrollment band.

Finding:
• When asked to describe the setting of their district, nearly 65 percent of the respondents,
    regardless of gender, indicated that their district is best described as rural while just more
    than a quarter describe their district as suburban. This is closely aligned with data from the
    National Center on Education Statistics.

Findings:
•   In 2013, 49.6 percent of the respondents described their districts as economically stable while
    43.1 percent of respondents described their districts as in declining economic condition. Since
    then, district economic conditions have improved steadily, albeit not dramatically.
•   Female superintendents are consistently less optimistic about the economic stability of their
    district. This trend has been consistent in recent years.

Finding:
•   As previously reported, white (not Hispanic) superintendents represent the vast majority of
    superintendents responding to the study regardless of district size, which is consistent with
    the findings of The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study as well as findings
    from the 2018–2019 salary studies. Note: As indicated in the introduction, care should be
    exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences from the very small numbers of respondents
    in some of the racial/cultural groups, other than the fact that white (not Hispanic)
    superintendents are the largest group represented in the study other racial/cultural groups
    appear to be underrepresented in the superintendent ranks, especially when compared to the
    racial/cultural profile of American public school enrollment.

Finding:
•   Considering the small representation of some racial/cultural group respondents, it is difficult
    to draw conclusions from these data, although the absence of diversity in urban districts again
    represents an anomaly when one considers the diversity of the student population generally
    understood to be enrolled in many urban districts.

Finding:
   •   Taking into consideration the small number of respondents from some racial/cultural
       groups, the range of median age of superintendents was 35–41 while the median age of
       white (not Hispanic) superintendents was 52.

    counterparts from other racial/cultural groups.

Finding:
• While the numbers are too small for most racial/cultural groups to draw definitive
   conclusions, there is some limited evidence that minority superintendents have served longer
   in the superintendency than white (not Hispanic) superintendents.

Finding:
 • Except for Black or African American superintendents, about half of respondents indicated
    that their district is in stable condition. Over one fourth of districts are reported to be in
    declining economic conditions. Again, care should be taken with over-interpreting the data
    because of the limited number of minority superintendents responding to the survey.

Findings:
•   Consistent with findings in previous editions of the study, the larger the student
    enrollment of the district, the higher the mean base salary for
    assistant/associate superintendents. It is noted that in the smallest of districts,
    these positions often do not exist.
•   A modest but consistent increase in median salaries is seen over previous editions
    of this study.

    Finding:
    •   Elementary school principals generally follow the same trend as their high school and middle
        school counterparts, although for the first time, their 2017 median base salary in the largest
        districts has crossed the $100,000 line. This trend continued in the 2018 study. In more recent
        studies, medium size districts joined this trend.

Finding
•   As mentioned above, a metric of growing importance in the private sector is the ratio of the
    entry-level worker compensation with the base salary (without incentives) of the CEO.
    Accordingly, the median entry-level salary of teachers is presented compared with the
    median salary of the superintendents arrayed by district size. The data confirms that as the
    district enrolment increases so does the ratio. In addition, the ratio has appeared to generally
    widen over the past five survey periods, regardless of the district enrollment.

      •     When responses are considered by gender, twice as many males as female superintendents
            worked for boards that employed legal counsel to negotiate their employment agreements.
