              SALARY & BENEFITS STUDY

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The 2020-21 AASA Superintendent Salary & Benefits Study marks the ninth consecutive
edition of this study. The 2020-2021 version employed a slightly revised and updated
survey instrument. The survey tracks the demographics, salary, benefits, and other
elements of the employment agreements of school superintendents throughout the
country.

This year’s study is based on 1,518 responses. The survey was distributed online and
relied on superintendents responding to 64 items with the understanding that the
report of findings would contain no personally identifiable information. Therefore,
readers must consider the data descriptive and not necessarily representative of all
superintendents. The study is intended to provide superintendents with actionable
information needed to negotiate and manage their compensation and benefits.

Prior to the AASA efforts to study this topic, most school superintendents relied on the
annual salary study sponsored by the Education Research Service (ERS) to benchmark
their compensation and benefits. The closure of ERS nearly a decade ago created a void
in data about superintendent salary and benefits. AASA responded to the need for data
by developing a comprehensive study of the salary and benefits of school
superintendents that far exceeded previous studies undertaken on this topic. AASA is
particularly well suited for this task because it represents the vast majority of school
superintendents in the country and has been most active in collecting and
disseminating to its members critical data needed to inform superintendent decision
making about a host of topics.

AASA is committed to refining this work over time, thus maximizing the benefit to
superintendents. The earlier editions of this study are available on the AASA website
and provide valuable retrospective data (http://www.aasa.org/research.aspx).

This work complements The American School Superintendent: 2020 Decennial Study edited
by Professor Christopher H. Tienken, the AASA Research Professor in Residence and
Associate Professor of Education Leadership, Management and Policy from Seton Hall
University, sponsored by AASA in conjunction with Phi Delta Kappa. The official press

In addition, there is an inevitable comparison between public and private sector CEOs.
Useful in this discussion is the work of Economic Policy Institute in its analysis on private
sector CEO compensation and its relationship to median employee pay:

METHODOLOGY

The research team was comprised of Christian Rogers, AASA legislative analyst; Dr.
Christopher H. Tienken, AASA Research Professor in Residence and Associate
Professor if Education Leadership, Management, and Policy; Dr. George J. Petersen,
Professor and Founding Dean of the College of Education at Clemson University; and
Dr. Lavetta Ross, quantitative research professor/adjunct, Monmouth University.
Assistance was also provided by Robert S. McCord, AASA research consultant. The
research was conducted under the direct supervision of Noelle Ellerson Ng, AASA
Associate Executive Director, Policy and Advocacy.

An extensive survey instrument was originally developed in 2012 with the assistance of
Professors Theodore J. Kowalski (University of Dayton), I. Phillip Young (University of
South Carolina), Terry Orr (Bank Street College) and Christopher C. Stream (University
of Nevada, Las Vegas). The survey instrument was revised in June and July 2020 by the
research team for the current edition of the study. The research team sent the revised
instrument for peer review by eight superintendents:
    • Dr. Burke Royster, Superintendent Greenville County Schools, Greenville, SC.
    • Dr. Lee D’Andrea, Superintendent (Retired), Anderson School District Four and
       Pickens County School District, SC.
    • Dr. Holly Edds, Superintendent, Orcutt Union School District, Orcutt, CA.
    • Dr. Anne Hubbard, Superintendent, Hope Elementary School District, Santa
       Barbara, CA.
    • Mrs. Susan Salucci, Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources, Orcutt Union
       School District, Orcutt, CA.
    • Dr. Michael Lubelfeld, Superintendent of Schools, North Shore School District
       112, Highland Park, IL.
    • Dr. Angelica M. Ramsey, Superintendent of Schools, Pleasant Valley School
       District, Camarillo, CA.
    • Mr. Kenyon Kummings, Superintendent of Schools, Wildwood City School
       District, NJ.



                                                                                           2
Further revisions were made to the survey instrument for clarity and to aid readability
following the peer review.

Using a commercially prepared mailing list of American public school superintendents,
more than 8046 email invitations to participate were distributed during the months of
October, November, and December 2020. State association executive directors were
contacted to encourage their members to respond to the online survey.

REPORT OF FINDINGS

This report of findings is divided into 11 sections and relies solely on measures of
central tendency for this analysis of the data collected. These data are generally
disaggregated by gender, district enrollment, and racial/cultural group.

As noted in previous reports, there are limitations on the proper use of the data. For
example, when the responses for certain items are disaggregated by racial/cultural
group, the number of responses may be insufficient to support decision making. Care
should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences on this data element. In
addition, some survey fatigue is commonly reported by superintendents and could
have impacted the return rate, although the number of valid responses exceeded the
2019-2020 study by 100+.

Superintendents are inundated with research requests resulting in selective
participation in those studies seen as most important to the role of the superintendent
or of benefit to their district. After each data display, the report authors have offered a
general statement of findings. It is the intent of the authors to allow the readers the
opportunity to disaggregate the data in a manner they find useful in working with their
board of education.

There were 1,518 responses to the survey. After carefully checking the data, responses
from nine participants were omitted as the research team found them to be invalid
because of issues such as unverifiable salary entries or too many questions that were not
answers. The final sample size was 1,509. The nine omitted participant responses
equated to 0.6% of the total responses; 99.4% of the sample was retained.

The researcher did have to omit some incomplete responses to individual questions and
participants themselves chose to omit some responses to specific questions. Those
questions with the highest percentages of omitted responses centered on salary
information for assistant/associate/deputy superintendent, high school principal,
middle school principal, elementary school principal, and the starting salary for a first-
year teacher with a BA. The salary responses for superintendents had the lowest
percentage of omitted data (n=14, 0.9%), followed by elementary school principal salary



                                                                                         3
data (n=101, 7%), then high school principal salary data (n=138, 9%), and starting salary
for a first-year teacher with a BA (n=140, 9.1%).

The highest percentage of omitted data occurred for the assistant/associate/deputy
superintendent (n=548, 36.7%). This is not uncommon because some school districts do
not have such a position because of enrollment size or budget constraints. The second
largest amount of data omitted was salary data for middle school principals (n=285,
18.7%). Again, this could be due to the configuration of some school districts, such as
grades PreK-8 or PreK-6. In addition, some total percentages may total between 99.5%
and 100.2% due to rounding.

Having clearly identified the limitations inherent in a study of this magnitude, the
report that follows is replete with important information that can prove very useful to
superintendents.

rural with almost 30 percent describing their district as suburban and 18 percent as
urban. This is closely aligned with data from the National Center on Educational
Statistics.

Findings: Most superintendents reported serving in their present position for less than
five years, with just 13 percent serving more than ten years. This finding is consistent
with previous findings. No appreciable difference is noted when service in present
position is considered by gender.

Findings: Male superintendents reported serving in the superintendency longer than
females, although the longevity of female superintendents has increased substantially
over the previous years of this study and The American School Superintendent: 2020
Decennial Study.

Findings: In the 2019-20 report 32 percent of female superintendents described their
districts as in declining economic condition along with 25.1 percent of male
superintendents. The findings for this year’s investigation show a trend of more
superintendents, male and female, feeling less optimistic about the economic stability of
their districts.

Findings: As previously reported, White (not Hispanic) superintendents represent the
majority of superintendents responding to the study regardless of district size, which is
consistent with the findings of The American School Superintendent: 2020 Decennial Study as
well as findings from the 2019–2020 salary studies.

Note: As indicated in the introduction, care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or
inferences from the very small numbers of respondents in some of the racial/cultural
groups, other than the fact that White (not Hispanic) superintendents are the largest group
represented in the study. Other racial/cultural groups appear to be underrepresented in
the superintendent ranks, especially when compared to the racial/cultural profile of
American public school enrollment.

Findings: Considering the small representation of some racial/cultural group
respondents, it is difficult to draw conclusions from these data, although the absence of
diversity in urban districts again represents an anomaly when one considers the
diversity of the student population generally understood to be enrolled in many urban
districts.

Findings: Given the small number of respondents from some racial/cultural groups,
White (not Hispanic) superintendents have served longer in their current position than
their counterparts from other racial/cultural groups.

Findings: While the numbers are too small for most racial/cultural groups to draw
definitive conclusions, the evidence in this year’s investigation shows White (not
Hispanic) superintendents have served longer in the superintendency than non-White
superintendents.

Findings: In the 2019-20 report, over one-fourth of superintendent respondents reported
that their districts were in declining economic condition.

The findings for this year’s investigation show a trend of more superintendents feeling
less optimistic about the economic stability of their districts with over 35% indicating
their districts to be in declining economic conditions and 55% indicating their districts
to be in stable condition. Again, care should be taken with over-interpreting the data
because of the limited number of minority superintendents responding to the survey.

Findings: When base salary is considered by racial/cultural group, some variation is
noted, although the small number of respondents in some groups makes definitive
analysis difficult if not inappropriate.

Findings: Consistent with findings in previous editions of the study, the larger the
student enrollment of the district, the higher the mean base salary for
assistant/associate superintendents when sample sizes exceed 100 responses. It is noted


                                                                                         27
that in districts with lower enrollments, these positions often do not exist. A modest but
consistent increase in median salaries is seen over previous editions of this study.

Findings: Elementary school principals generally follow the same trend as their high
school and middle school counterparts, although for the second time, their 2020 median
base salary in the largest districts has crossed the $100,000 line. This trend has
continued since the 2017 study. In this year’s investigation, this trend was also observed
in medium and small sized districts.

Findings: The median entry-level salary of teachers is presented compared with the
median salary of superintendents arrayed by district size. The data confirms that as the
district enrollment increases so does the ratio of superintendent compensation. In
addition, the ratio appeared to widen over the past six survey periods, regardless of
district enrollment.

Findings: Where numbers were sufficient, there was little difference between
racial/cultural groups concerning the inclusion of directions or objectives from the
previous year’s assessment in the superintendent’s performance assessment. Black
superintendents were the least likely to have such a clause in their contract, but care
should be taken to interpret the findings in light of a small sample size (n=77).
