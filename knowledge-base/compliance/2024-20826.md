RIN 1545-BQ95

Tribal General Welfare Benefits

AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.

ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public hearing.

SUMMARY: This document contains proposed regulations regarding the exclusion

from gross income of certain Tribal general welfare benefits. The proposed regulations

address the requirements that would apply to determine whether the benefits that an

Indian Tribal government program provides qualify as Tribal general welfare benefits.

These proposed regulations would affect Indian Tribal governments, agencies or

instrumentalities of such governments, Federally-recognized Tribes, members of such

Tribes, such members’ spouses and dependents, and other Tribal program participants.

This document also requests comments on certain provisions and provides a notice of a

public hearing on the proposed regulations that will be in addition to Tribal consultation

on the proposed regulations.

DATES: Comments: Electronic or written comments on this proposed rule from the

public must be received by [INSERT DATE 90 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION

IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].

       Public Hearing: The public hearing is scheduled to be held on January 13, 2025,

at 10 a.m. Eastern time (ET). Requests to speak and outlines of topics to be discussed

at the public hearing must be received by [INSERT DATE 90 DAYS AFTER DATE OF

PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER]. If no outlines are received by
[INSERT DATE 90 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL

REGISTER], the public hearing will be cancelled. Requests to attend the public hearing

must be received by 5 p.m. ET on January 9, 2025. Requests for special assistance

during the hearing must be received by 5 p.m. ET on January 8, 2025. See the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Authority

       This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations
(26 CFR part 1) under section 139E of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). Section

139E(c)(3) provides an express delegation of authority for the Secretary of the Treasury

or her delegate (Secretary) to, “in consultation with the Tribal Advisory Committee (as

established under section 3(a) of the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014),

establish guidelines for what constitutes lavish or extravagant benefits with respect to

Indian tribal government programs.” The proposed regulations are also issued under

the express delegation of authority under section 7805(a) of the Code.

Background

       This notice of proposed rulemaking contains proposed amendments to the

Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) to implement section 139E of the Internal

Revenue Code (Code).

       Section 61 of the Code provides that, except as otherwise provided by law, the

term “gross income” means all income from whatever source derived. The term

“income” is broadly defined as “instances of undeniable accessions to wealth, clearly

realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion.” Commissioner v.

Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U.S. 426, 431 (1955). As a general rule, exclusions from

income are construed narrowly, and taxpayers must bring themselves within the clear

scope of the exclusion for the exclusion to apply. Commissioner v. Schleier, 515 U.S.

323, 328-329 (1995). Tribal members are subject to the same requirement to pay

Federal income taxes as non-Tribal members, unless exempted by a treaty or

agreement between the United States and the Tribal member’s Tribe or an Act of

Congress dealing with Indian affairs. Squire v. Capoeman, 351 U.S. 1, 6 (1956).

       Generally, if the provision of a benefit satisfies the requirements of section 139E

(discussed in part IV of this Background), section 139E will apply to exclude the value of

the benefit from the recipient’s gross income. If section 139E does not apply to exclude

a benefit from a recipient’s gross income, the benefit may, depending on the facts and
circumstances, separately qualify for exclusion from the recipient’s gross income under

another Code provision or the administrative general welfare exclusion (discussed in

part I of this Background), which pre-dates the enactment of section 139E. See Notice

2015-34 (2015-18 I.R.B. 942), discussed in part V of this Background.

I. Administrative General Welfare Exclusion

       The IRS generally has determined that payments made to or on behalf of

individuals by governmental units under legislatively provided social benefit programs

for the promotion of the general welfare are not includible in an individual recipient’s

Federal gross income; this concept is referred to in this preamble as the “administrative

general welfare exclusion.” See, e.g., Rev. Rul. 78-170, 1978-1 C.B. 24 (concluding

that amounts paid under the laws of the State of Ohio to low-income elderly and

disabled persons to help alleviate their cost of winter energy consumption are made for

the promotion of general welfare, and are not includible in the recipients’ gross income

for Federal income tax purposes); see also Rev. Rul. 76-395, 1976-2 C.B. 16 (applying

the general welfare exclusion to home rehabilitation grants to low-income families to

correct substandard conditions).

       To qualify under the administrative general welfare exclusion, payments must (1)

be paid from a governmental fund, (2) be for the promotion of the general welfare (that

is, based on the need of the individual or family receiving such payments), and (3) not

represent compensation for services absent a specific Federal income tax exclusion.

See Notice 2023-56, 2023-38 I.R.B. 824.

       Payments that are based on some criteria other than individual or family need do

not qualify for the administrative general welfare exclusion. Compare Rev. Rul. 76-395,

1976-2 C.B. 16 (home rehabilitation grants received by low-income homeowners

residing in a defined area of a city under the city's community development program

funded under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 are in the nature of
general welfare and are not includible in their gross income) with Rev. Rul. 76-131,

1976-1 C.B. 16 (payments made by the State of Alaska to individuals at least 65 years

of age who have maintained an Alaska domicile for at least 25 years to encourage them

to continue their residence in the State did not qualify under the general welfare

exclusion because the payments were made to residents regardless of financial status,

health, educational background, or employment status).

       The administrative general welfare exclusion does not generally apply to permit a

business to exclude payments from gross income because such payments are not

based on individual or family need. See Bailey v. Commissioner, 88 T.C. 1293, 1300-

1301 (1987), acq. 1989-2 C.B. 1; Revenue Ruling 2005-46 (2005-2 C.B. 120).

II. Application of the Administrative General Welfare Exclusion to Indian Tribal

Governments

       Indian Tribal governments have a unique legal status. They have sovereignty

that pre-dates the United States and therefore have a government-to-government

relationship with the United States. Indian Tribal governments have developed a broad

range of programs to address their unique social, cultural, and economic issues. The

administrative general welfare exclusion applies to benefits provided by Indian Tribal

governments no less favorably than it applies to benefits provided by Federal, State, or

local governments. Thus, benefits provided by Indian Tribal governments qualify for the

administrative general welfare exclusion if the benefits are (1) made pursuant to a

governmental program of the Tribe; (2) for the promotion of general welfare (that is,

based on individual or family need); and (3) not compensation for services.

III. Revenue Procedure 2014-35

       In 2014, the Treasury Department and the IRS issued Revenue Procedure
2014-35 (2014-26 I.R.B. 1110),1 which provides safe harbors under which the IRS

conclusively presumes that the individual need requirement of the administrative

general welfare exclusion is met for benefits provided under Indian Tribal

governmental programs that meet the safe harbor requirements. The revenue

procedure provides that the IRS will not assert that recipients of benefits under a

safe harbor must include the value of those benefits in gross income or that the

benefits are subject to the information reporting requirements of section 6041 of the

Code. The safe harbors apply if the following requirements are met: (1) the benefit

is provided pursuant to a specific Indian Tribal government program, (2) the program

has written guidelines specifying how the individual qualifies for the benefit; (3) the

benefit is available to any Tribal member and certain other individuals who satisfy

the program’s guidelines; (4) the program does not discriminate in favor of members

of the governing body; (5) the benefit is not lavish or extravagant under the

circumstances, and (6) the benefit is not compensation for services. See section

5.02(1) of Revenue Procedure 2014-35. Categories of qualifying benefits include

housing, education, elder and disabled person care, and cultural activities. See

section 5.02(2) of Revenue Procedure 2014-35. In addition, nominal cash honoraria

and items of cultural significance that are not lavish or extravagant provided to religious

or spiritual officials or leaders in connection with their participation in cultural, religious,

and social events, are not treated as compensation for services (and therefore are not

gross income) under the revenue procedure. See section 5.03 of Revenue Procedure

2014-35.

IV. The Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014

       On August 2, 2013, H.R. 3043, 113th Cong. (2013), whose short title was the


1 Revenue Procedure 2014-35 was preceded by Notice 2012-75 (2012-51 I.R.B. 715).    The IRS received
over 40 comments in response to Notice 2012-75, which informed the drafting of Revenue Procedure
2014-35.
Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2013, was introduced in the United States

House of Representatives and referred to the Committee on Ways and Means. On that

same date, an identical bill was introduced in the United States Senate and referred to

the Committee on Finance. On September 16, 2014, after its short title was revised to

the “Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014,” H.R. 3043 was passed by the

House of Representatives after a floor debate (House Debate). See Cong. Rec. H7599-

7603 (September 16, 2014). On September 17, 2014, after being received by the

Senate, H.R.3043 was the subject of a colloquy (Senate Colloquy). See Cong. Rec.

S5686-5687 (September 17, 2014). On September 18, 2024, H.R. 3043 was passed by

the Senate by unanimous consent. See Cong. Rec. S5862 (September 18, 2014). On

September 26, 2014, the President of the United States approved the United States

Congress’s enactment of the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014 (Act), Public

Law 113-168, 128 Stat. 1883 (2014).

       The Act, among other things, amended the Code by adding section 139E. Under

section 139E, gross income does not include the value of any “Indian general welfare

benefit,” which this notice of proposed rulemaking refers to as a “Tribal General Welfare

Benefit.” Section 139E(b) defines a Tribal general welfare benefit as any payment

made or services provided to or on behalf of a member of a Tribe (or any spouse or

dependent of such a member) pursuant to an Indian Tribal government program, but

only if: (1) the program is administered under specified guidelines and does not

discriminate in favor of members of the governing body of the Tribe, and (2) the benefits

provided under such program are (A) available to any Tribal member who meets such

guidelines, (B) for the promotion of general welfare, (C) not lavish or extravagant, and

(D) not compensation for services. Further, section 139E(c)(5) provides that any items

of cultural significance, reimbursement of costs, or cash honorarium for participation in

cultural or ceremonial activities for the transmission of Tribal culture “shall not be treated
as compensation for services.”

       Section 2(c) of the Act provides that ambiguities in section 139E are to be

resolved in favor of Indian Tribal governments. Section 2(c) of the Act also requires that

deference be given to Indian Tribal governments for the programs administered and

authorized by the Tribe to benefit the general welfare of the Tribal community.

       Section 2(d)(1) of the Act provides that section 139E shall apply to taxable years

for which the period of limitation on refund or credit under section 6511 of the Code of

1986 has not expired. Section 2(d)(2) of the Act provides that if the period of limitation

on a credit or refund resulting from the enactment of section 139E expires before the

end of the 1–year period beginning on the date of the enactment of the Act, refund or

credit of such overpayment (to the extent attributable to such amendments) may,

nevertheless, be made or allowed if claim therefor is filed before the close of such 1–

year period.

       Section 3 of the Act requires the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a Tribal

Advisory Committee. The Department of the Treasury Tribal Advisory Committee

(TTAC) held its inaugural meeting on June 20, 2019. Under section 3(b) of the Act, the

TTAC’s mandate is to advise the Secretary of the Treasury on matters relating to the

taxation of Indians, and the Secretary of the Treasury is required to consult with the

TTAC to establish and require training and education for internal revenue field agents

who administer and enforce internal revenue laws. This includes (A) training and

education with respect to Federal Indian law and the Federal Government’s unique legal

treaty and trust relationship with Indian Tribal governments, and (B) training of such

internal revenue field agents, and provision of training and technical assistance to Tribal

financial officers, about implementation of the Act and the amendments made by the

Act.

       Section 4(a) of the Act requires the Secretary of the Treasury to temporarily
suspend “all audits and examinations of Indian Tribal governments and members of

Tribes (or any spouse or dependent of such a member), to the extent such an audit or

examination relates to the exclusion of a payment or benefit from an Indian Tribal

government under the general welfare exclusion” until the training and education

described above is completed. Section 4(a) further provides that the period of limitation

under section 6501 of the Code is suspended during the period of suspension.

V. Notice 2015-34

       Following the addition of section 139E to the Code, the IRS published Notice

2015-34 (2015-18 I.R.B. 942), providing guidance to taxpayers regarding the effect of

section 139E on Revenue Procedure 2014-35. Notice 2015-34 provides that section

139E codifies (but does not supplant) the administrative general welfare exclusion for

certain benefits provided under Indian Tribal government programs. Notice 2015-34

provides that taxpayers can rely on Revenue Procedure 2014-35 for the safe harbors

under which certain benefits provided by Indian Tribal government programs may be

excluded from gross income under the administrative general welfare exclusion.

Additionally, Notice 2015-34 requested comments on (1) what guidelines may be helpful

to Indian Tribal governments to determine whether benefits are lavish or extravagant

under section 139E(b); (2) what Tribal customs or government practices may establish

an Indian Tribal government program administered through specific guidelines under

section 139E(b)(1) and (c)(4) and how such programs may be identified; and (3) how

items of cultural significance, cash honoraria, and cultural or ceremonial activities for the

transmission of Tribal culture under section 139E(c)(5) should be defined.

VI. TTAC Report and Tribal Consultations on Section 139E

       Members of the TTAC formed a Subcommittee on the Act’s General Welfare

Exclusion (GWE Subcommittee) in 2019 to provide the TTAC with technical expertise

on recommendations for the implementation of the Act. On June 16, 2021, the GWE
Subcommittee submitted to the TTAC a report (TTAC Report) containing the GWE

Subcommittee’s interpretation of the core principles underlying section 139E, and an

Appendix containing draft proposed regulations interpreting section 139E (TTAC draft

proposed regulations), consistent with those core principles. On October 26, 2022, the

TTAC formally recommended and approved the TTAC Report to be submitted for the

record and published for Tribal comment.

       The Treasury Department sent a Tribal consultation letter, dated October 27,

2022 (Dear Tribal Leader Letter), to Tribal leaders to request consultation on the Act

and the TTAC Report. The Dear Tribal Leader Letter announced consultation meetings

to be held on December 14, 15, and 16, 2022 (December 2022 Consultations), to

discuss the Act and the TTAC Report. The Dear Tribal Leader Letter also requested

responses to certain questions related to the interpretation of particular provisions of

section 139E, as well as comments on the TTAC Report. In response to the Dear Tribal

Leader Letter, and after the December 2022 Consultations, the Treasury Department

received 65 written comments from Tribes and two Tribal organizations (collectively,

Tribal Comments).

       The Tribal Comments were broadly supportive of the recommendations in the

TTAC Report,2 including the TTAC draft proposed regulations. In general, the Tribal

Comments emphasized that the Act, particularly section 2(c) of the Act, requires the

Treasury Department to recognize the sovereignty of Tribes by granting broad

deference to Indian Tribal governments in the design and implementation of their

general welfare programs, as well as with respect to any ambiguities in the statute.

Deference to Indian Tribal governments was a guiding principle in the Tribal Comments

addressing each of the questions for which the Treasury Department requested



2 However, a few Tribal Comments argued that Congress has not specifically directed the Treasury

Department and the IRS to publish regulations under section 139E.
comment. For example, many Tribal Comments stated that any Treasury Department

and IRS guidance imposing specific requirements for a general welfare program, such

as what constitutes “the promotion of the general welfare,” what is a “lavish or

extravagant” benefit, or what are “cultural or ceremonial activities,” would infringe upon

Indian Tribal sovereignty. Many Tribal Comments urged that section 2(c) of the Act be

expressly cited in the proposed regulations.

       Another area of significant concern raised in the Tribal Comments was ensuring

that the regulations under section 139E do not presumptively treat benefits as outside

the scope of section 139E solely because the benefits are provided to all eligible

recipients in an equal amount, or that the benefits are funded from gaming revenues.

This concern was primarily raised in relation to amounts that are set aside and paid

from net gaming revenues to provide for the general welfare of the Indian Tribe and its

members. See 25 U.S.C. 2710(b).

       Finally, the Tribal Comments addressed various other issues, including the

effective date of the proposed regulations, training of IRS agents, and coordination with

other Federal agencies. After considering these and other Tribal Comments and the

TTAC Report, and after consultation with the TTAC and the GWE Subcommittee, the

Treasury Department and the IRS propose to adopt new §1.139E-1 to provide guidance

under section 139E (proposed §1.139E-1). The following Explanation of Provisions

discusses the Tribal Comments in more detail in relation to each proposed provision in

proposed §1.139E-1.

Explanation of Provisions

       The proposed regulations would provide that the gross income of a Tribal

program participant does not include the value of any Tribal general welfare benefit

provided by an Indian Tribal government program.

       The provisions of proposed §1.139E-1 would provide (1) definitions of terms
used in section 139E and proposed §1.139E-1 (see proposed §1.139E-1(b));

(2) requirements for a program to qualify as an “Indian Tribal Government Program”

(see proposed §1.139E-1(c)); (3) requirements for a benefit to qualify as a “Tribal

General Welfare Benefit" (see proposed §1.139E-1(d)); (4) special rules related to

cultural or ceremonial activities (see proposed §1.139E-1(e)); (5) clarification of the

audit suspension required by section 4(a) of the Act (proposed §1.139E-1(f)); and (6)

the proposed date of applicability of the final regulations (see proposed §1.139E-1(g)).

The Treasury Department and the IRS will publish final regulations under section 139E

after consideration of oral and written comments received in connection with Tribal

consultation on these proposed regulations, consideration of any other comments

received in response to the proposed regulations, and further consultation with the

TTAC, including through the GWE Subcommittee.

I. Section 139E Definitions

        Section 139E(a) provides that gross income does not include the value of any

Tribal general welfare benefit. Section 139E(b) defines a Tribal general welfare benefit,

in relevant part, as any payment made or services provided to or on behalf of a member

of a Tribe (or any spouse or dependent of such a member) pursuant to a program that is

established by an Indian Tribal government and that satisfies specified requirements.

Proposed §1.139E-1(b) would define an Indian Tribal government, a Tribe, and the

individuals, including a Tribal member, spouse, and dependent, who may be determined

by the Indian Tribal government to be eligible for a general welfare benefit under section

139E.

A. Definition of Indian Tribal government

        Section 139E(c)(1) provides that the term “Indian Tribal government” includes

any agencies or instrumentalities of an Indian Tribal government and any Alaska Native

regional or village corporation, as defined in, or established pursuant to, the Alaska
Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (Alaska Native

Corporations). Revenue Procedure 2014-35 provides that the term “Indian Tribal

government” has the same meaning as in section 7701(a)(40)(A) but for purposes of the

revenue procedure includes agencies or instrumentalities of the Indian Tribal

government. The TTAC Report and the Tribal Comments did not provide any

recommendations on the definition of Indian Tribal government and did not specifically

address Alaska Native Corporations.

       If used in a provision of the Code and not otherwise distinctly expressed or

manifestly incompatible with the intent thereof, section 7701(a)(40)(A) defines the term

“Indian Tribal government” to mean the governing body of any Tribe, band, community,

village, or group of Indians, or (if applicable) Alaska Natives, which is determined by the

Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, to exercise governmental

functions. Under the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, Public Law

103-454, 108 Stat. 4791 (List Act), the Secretary of the Interior is required to publish

annually a list of all Federally-recognized Tribes. In Revenue Procedure 2008-55

(2008-39 I.R.B. 768), after consultation with the Department of Interior (DOI), the

Treasury Department and the IRS determined that the Indian Tribal entities that appear

on the current or future lists of Federally-recognized Tribes published annually under

the List Act by the DOI, Bureau of Indian Affairs, are designated as Indian Tribal

governments for purposes of section 7701(a)(40). See 89 FR 944 (January 8, 2024) for

the most current list published by the DOI, Bureau of Indian Affairs.

       Proposed §1.139E-1(b)(4) would define the term “Indian Tribal Government” by

reference to section 7701(a)(40). In addition, in accordance with section 139E(c)(1), the

definition of Indian Tribal government for purposes of proposed §1.139E-1(b)(4) also

would include agencies and instrumentalities of the Indian Tribal government. This

definition is consistent with Revenue Procedure 2014-35.
       Although the definition of Indian Tribal government under section 139E(c)(1)

includes Alaska Native Corporations, these proposed regulations would not include

Alaska Native Corporations in the definition of Indian Tribal government for purposes of

these rules and instead reserve proposed §1.139E-2 for the rules to apply section 139E

to benefits provided by Alaska Native Corporations. The Treasury Department and the

IRS intend on holding consultation before issuing future guidance on issues related to

the application of section 139E to benefits provided by Alaska Native Corporations.

B. Definition of Tribe

       Section 139E does not define the term “Indian Tribe,” but section 4(c)(2) of the

Act defines it by cross-reference to that term as defined in section 45A(c)(6) of the

Code. Revenue Procedure 2014-35 also defines “Indian Tribe” by cross-reference to

section 45A(c)(6). The TTAC Report and the Tribal Comments did not provide any

recommendations on the definition of “Indian Tribe,” which, for purposes of these

proposed regulations, is referred to as simply ”Tribe.”

       Section 45A relates to the Indian employment credit, which was applicable for

taxable years prior to January 1, 2022. Section 45A(c)(6) defines “Indian Tribe” to

mean any Indian Tribe, band, nation, pueblo, or other organized group or community,

including any Alaska Native village, or regional or village corporation, as defined in, or

established pursuant to, ANCSA that is recognized as eligible for the special programs

and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as

Indians.

       Proposed §1.139E-1(b)(7) generally would define “Tribe” using the definition of

Indian Tribe in section 45A(c)(6). However, for ease of readability and to prevent

confusion arising from citing to an expired Code provision, the proposed regulations

would recite the language of section 45A(c)(6) rather than incorporating the definition by

cross-reference. As noted, proposed §1.139E-2 is reserved because the Treasury
Department and the IRS intend to issue future guidance under section 139E applicable

to benefits provided by Alaska Native Corporations. Accordingly, the proposed

regulations would exclude section 45A(c)(6)’s reference to Alaska Native regional and

village corporations as defined in and established pursuant to ANCSA for purposes of

these rules.

C. Definition of Tribal program participant

       Section 139E(b) provides that a Tribal general welfare benefit means any

payment made or services provided to or on behalf of a member of the Tribe (or any

spouse or dependent of such a member) pursuant to a program that satisfies specified

requirements. Revenue Procedure 2014-35 allows benefits to be provided to a member

of the Tribe, as well as a “qualified nonmember,” meaning a spouse, former spouse,

legally recognized domestic partner or former domestic partner, ancestor, descendant,

or dependent of a member of a Tribe.

       The TTAC Report and many Tribal Comments recommend that the proposed

regulations provide that individuals eligible for benefits not be limited to Tribal members

and their spouses and dependents, instead supporting the use of the more expansive

term “qualified nonmember” from Revenue Procedure 2014-35. The TTAC Report and

many Tribal Comments state that using this more expansive definition of “qualified

nonmember” would be consistent with the House Debate and Senate Colloquy that

explain the Act, and that section 139E should be viewed no less favorably than

Revenue Procedure 2014-35. Moreover, several Tribal Comments suggest that the

language “to or on behalf of” in section 139E(b) is ambiguous and thus supports the

proposed regulations adopting the definition of “qualified nonmember” from Revenue

Procedure 2014-35. In addition, the TTAC Report explains that depending on Tribal

culture, custom, or tradition, a member of a Tribe may have obligations to care for

extended family, and that existing Tribal general welfare programs may provide
assistance to these extended family members.

      The Treasury Department and the IRS have considered the TTAC Report and

the Tribal Comments and agree that an expansive definition of eligible individuals is

appropriate. Accordingly, proposed §1.139E-1(b)(8) would define the term “Tribal

Program Participant” to mean a Tribal member, spouse of a Tribal member (including a

spouse of a Tribal member within the meaning of §301.7701-18, or a spouse of a Tribal

member under applicable Tribal law), dependent of a Tribal member, or other individual

who has been determined by the Indian Tribal government to be eligible for a Tribal

general welfare benefit because such individual is, with respect to a Tribal member, an

ancestor, descendant, former spouse, widow or widower, or legally recognized domestic

partner or former domestic partner. This definition is intended to encompass the

categories of “qualified nonmember” that are covered by Revenue Procedure 2014-35,

with the clarification that a spouse may be a spouse under applicable Tribal law.

      The Treasury Department and the IRS note that the phrase “on behalf of” in

section 139E(b) does not make the section 139E exclusion applicable to the direct

recipient of a payment which was made by the Indian Tribal government “on behalf of”

the Tribal program participant. For example, a Tribal program participant who receives

a Tribal general welfare benefit from an Indian Tribal government program to provide

rental assistance can exclude the payment from the Tribal program participant's gross

income under section 139E regardless of whether the assistance is paid directly to the

Tribal program participant or paid to the landlord on behalf of the Tribal program

participant. In either case, however, section 139E does not apply to permit the landlord

to exclude the rental assistance payment from the landlord’s gross income.

D. Definition of Tribal member

      Section 139E does not define who is a “member of an Indian Tribe” or “Tribal

member.” Revenue Procedure 2014-35 defines who is a member of a Tribe by cross-
reference to 25 CFR 290.2, which defines a member of a Tribe as an individual who

meets the requirements established by applicable Tribal law for enrollment in the Tribe

and (1) is listed on the Tribal rolls of that Tribe if such rolls are kept, or (2) is recognized

as a member by the Tribal governing body if Tribal rolls are not kept. The TTAC Report

and the Tribal Comments did not provide any recommendations on the definition of a

member of a Tribe.

       Proposed §1.139E-1(b)(9) would define the term “Tribal Member” in a manner

similar to Revenue Procedure 2014-35’s definition of “member of an Indian Tribe.” The

proposed regulations would adopt the same definition but, for ease of readability, would

incorporate the language from 25 CFR 290.2 rather than providing a cross-reference.

Thus, the proposed regulations would define “Tribal Member” as an individual who is a

member or citizen of the Tribe that establishes or maintains the Indian Tribal

government program because the individual meets the requirements established by

applicable Tribal law for enrollment in the Tribe and (1) is listed on the Tribal rolls of that

Tribe if such rolls are kept, or (2) is recognized as a member by the Tribal governing

body if Tribal rolls are not kept. In addition, the Treasury Department and the IRS are

aware that some Tribes temporarily close their rolls for enrollment or do not enroll

children until they reach a certain age. These Tribes may provide benefits to an

individual on the basis that the individual may be eligible for benefits, even though not

formally a Tribal member. In particular, Tribes may provide benefits to an Indian child

under the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, Public Law 95-608, 92 Stat. 3069 (1978),

codified at 25 U.S.C. 1903(4). The Indian Child Welfare Act defines “Indian child” as

any unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a member of a Tribe

or (b) is eligible for membership in a Tribe and is the biological child of a member of a

Tribe. To ensure that Indian Tribal governments may provide general welfare benefits

to an Indian child under section 139E, the proposed regulations also would include in
the definition of Tribal member an “Indian child” as defined in 25 U.S.C. 1903.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS recognize that an Indian Tribal

government generally develops programs with the intention of providing general welfare

benefits to or for the benefit of its own Tribal members. The Treasury Department and

the IRS interpret section 139E(b) as providing a relationship nexus between the Indian

Tribal government providing the general welfare benefit and the individual receiving the

benefit. Thus, the proposed regulations would define the term Tribal member to mean a

member of the Tribe that establishes or maintains the Indian Tribal government

program. However, solely for purposes of the rule in section 139E(c)(5) relating to

benefits provided for participation in ceremonial or cultural activities, proposed §1.139E-

1(b)(8)(ii) would provide that the recipient of such benefits may be a member of a Tribe

that is different from the Tribe that establishes or maintains the program.

E. Definition of spouse

       Section 139E does not define the term “spouse,” nor does Revenue Procedure

2014-35. The TTAC Report and the Tribal Comments did not provide any

recommendations on the definition of spouse for purposes of section 139E.

       Section 301.7701-18(a) of the Procedure and Administration Regulations (26

CFR part 301) provides that, for Federal tax purposes, the term spouse means an

individual lawfully married to another individual. Section 301.7701-18(b) generally

provides that a marriage of two individuals is recognized for Federal tax purposes if the

marriage is recognized by the state, possession, or territory of the United States in

which the marriage is entered into, regardless of domicile. Section 301.7701-18(a)

does not specifically refer to a marriage recognized under Tribal law because Tribal

lands are not states, possessions or territories of the United States or foreign

jurisdictions. However, the term "spouse" would include individuals married under

Tribal law if the marriage would be recognized under the laws of any state, possession,
or territory of the United States. See also 1 U.S.C. 7.

       Because §301.7701-18(a) defines spouse for Federal tax purposes, that

definition applies for purposes of section 139E and would apply by default under

proposed regulations. However, as noted in part I.C. of this Explanation of Provisions

section, the proposed regulations would include in the definition of Tribal program

participant the spouse of a Tribal member, as determined under applicable Tribal law,

whether or not recognized under §301.7701-18(a) and 1 U.S.C. 7.

F. Definition of dependent

       Section 139E(c)(2) defines the term “dependent” to mean a dependent as

defined in section 152 of the Code, determined without regard to section 152(b)(1),

(b)(2), and (d)(1)(B). Revenue Procedure 2014-35 does not define dependent, and the

TTAC Report and the Tribal Comments did not provide any recommendations on the

definition of dependent for purposes of section 139E.

       Section 152(a) defines dependent to mean an individual who is a qualifying child

or qualifying relative of the taxpayer. Section 152(b) provides that an individual who is a

qualifying child or a qualifying relative of a taxpayer is not a taxpayer’s dependent in

certain circumstances. Section 152(b)(1) provides that if an individual is a dependent of

a taxpayer, that individual is treated as having no dependents. Section 152(b)(2)

provides that, to be a dependent of a taxpayer, an individual must not have filed a joint

return with his or her spouse. Section 152(d)(1)(B) provides that qualifying relative does

not include an individual whose income is not less than the exemption amount set forth

in section 151(d) of the Code.3 For purposes of section 139E, an individual who for the

year is a dependent of a taxpayer who is him or herself a dependent, who files a joint

return with the individual’s spouse, or whose income is not less than the applicable limit


3 For taxable years in which the exemption amount is zero, the section 151(d) exemption amount is
generally the inflation-adjusted section 152(d)(1)(B) exemption amount in the annual revenue procedure
setting forth inflation-adjusted items that is published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.
for section 152(d)(1)(B) ($5,050 for 2024) is a dependent of a Tribal member if the other

requirements of section 152 are satisfied, pursuant to section 139E(c)(2).

       Proposed §1.139E-1(b)(10) would define the term “dependent” in accordance

with the definition in section 139E(c)(2). However, for ease of readability, the proposed

regulations would not cite the specific Code sections, but instead would describe the

rules for determining who is a dependent under section 152 without regard to section

152(b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B).

II. Indian Tribal Government Program

       Under section 139E(b), a benefit is a Tribal general welfare benefit if it meets

certain requirements and is provided pursuant to an Indian Tribal government program,

but only if the program is administered under specified guidelines and does not

discriminate in favor of members of the governing body of the Tribe. Section 139E(c)(4)

provides that a program will not fail to be treated as an Indian Tribal government

program solely by reason of the program being established by Tribal custom or

government practice. Revenue Procedure 2014-35 provides that, to qualify for the safe

harbors provided therein, there must be a specific Tribal program, the program must

have written guidelines specifying how an individual qualifies for the benefit, and the

program cannot discriminate in favor of members of the governing body.

       Some Tribal Comments suggest that programs established by Tribal custom or

government practice without written documentation (that is, programs established under

oral and unwritten customs or traditions) should satisfy the statutory requirement in

section 139E(b)(1) that the program be administered under specified guidelines. These

Tribal Comments recommend that the proposed regulations allow Indian Tribal

governments to demonstrate the existence of “specified guidelines” for these programs

through statements, affidavits, or declarations that describe how the Tribe has operated

the program in the past. Other Tribal Comments argue that section 139E(b)(1) neither
specifies who establishes the “specified guidelines” nor defines the term “specified,” and

that the proposed regulations should presume that a program administered by or

pursuant to Tribal resolution or other action by a Tribe’s governing body is “administered

under specified guidelines.” The TTAC Report and the Tribal Comments did not

specifically address the requirement that the program not discriminate in favor of

members of the governing body.

      The Treasury Department and the IRS read section 139E(b) as requiring both

that a program be established by an Indian Tribal government, and that the program be

administered under specified guidelines. This reading is similar to the requirements in

Revenue Procedure 2014-35 that there must be a specific Tribal program, and that the

program must have guidelines specifying how an individual qualifies for the benefit.

Proposed §1.139E-1(c) generally would adopt these two requirements and would

explain how an Indian Tribal government program can meet these requirements. The

proposed regulations also would address the requirement that the program not

discriminate in favor of members of the governing body.

A. Program must be established

      Proposed §1.139E-1(c)(2) would provide that a program must be established by

an Indian Tribal government and that the program may be established by Tribal custom,

government practice, or formal action of the Indian Tribal government under applicable

Tribal law. The proposed regulations also would provide that to the extent permitted by

applicable Tribal law, an Indian Tribal government may delegate authority to establish

general welfare programs to a designated individual or entity of the Indian Tribal

government.

      While an Indian Tribal government may find it helpful to set forth the creation of a

program through a written document, the proposed regulations would not specifically

require a written document to memorialize the establishment of the program. However,
the proposed regulations would refer to applicable Tribal law to determine whether a

writing is required for formal actions of the Indian Tribal government. For example, if

Tribal law requires all formal actions of the Indian Tribal government to be in writing,

then proposed §1.139E-1(c)(2) would also require the establishment of the program to

be in writing. If written documentation of the Indian Tribal government program is not

required under Tribal law, and the Indian Tribal government does not provide written

documentation of the Indian Tribal government program, the use of affidavits or Indian

Tribal government declarations, whether oral or written, may be used to substantiate the

establishment of the program. For example, the transcript of the minutes of an Indian

Tribal government session that describe the creation of the program may be sufficient to

establish an Indian Tribal government program under these proposed regulations.

B. Program must be administered under specified guidelines

       Proposed §1.139E-1(c)(3) would provide the requirements for the administration

of the program under specified guidelines. In general, the specified guidelines of the

program represent the framework for the program’s operations. Thus, the proposed

regulations would provide that the specified guidelines of the program must include, at a

minimum, a description of the program to provide Tribal general welfare benefits, the

benefits provided by the program (including how benefits are determined), the eligibility

requirements for the program, and the process for receiving benefits under the program.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS agree with the TTAC Report and the

Tribal Comments that section 139E does not require the specified guidelines of the

program to be memorialized in a written document. However, Indian Tribal

governments are encouraged to set forth the specified guidelines in writing to assist

recipients in determining whether a benefit received under the program is excludable

from gross income under section 139E. In particular, recipients of Tribal general

welfare benefits who are contacted by the IRS will need to substantiate that the benefit
is excludable from gross income under section 139E and may not have any written

documentation in their possession to do so. If the Indian Tribal government has

documented in writing the specific guidelines of the program, the individual recipient of

the benefit may use the written documentation to substantiate that the benefit received

is intended to be a Tribal general welfare benefit that is excludable from gross income

under section 139E.

C. Program cannot discriminate in favor of members of the governing body

       In accordance with section 139E(b)(1), proposed §1.139E-1(c)(4) would provide

that one of the requirements for an Indian Tribal government program is that the

program not discriminate in favor of members of the governing body of the Tribe (non-

discrimination requirement). Proposed §1.139E-1(c)(4)(i) would generally define a

governing body as the legislative body of the Tribe, such as the Tribal Council, or the

representative equivalent of the legislative body of the Tribe. However, the Treasury

Department and the IRS are aware that the form and membership of the governing

body of a Tribe may vary between Tribes. For example, a Tribe may form its governing

body to include all Tribal members, known as a general council Tribe. To ensure that a

general council Tribe is not prevented from satisfying this requirement, proposed

§1.139E-1(c)(4)(ii) would provide that a program is treated as being in compliance with

the non-discrimination requirement if the governing body of the Tribe consists of the

entire adult membership of the Tribe.

       Proposed §1.139E-1(c)(4)(iii) would provide a facts and circumstances test to

determine whether a program, either by its terms or in its administration, discriminates

in favor of members of the governing body of the Tribe. For example, the administration

of a program would discriminate in favor of members of the governing body if, based on

the facts and circumstances, the benefits provided during the taxable year

disproportionately favor members of the governing body of the Tribe because of their
status as members of the governing body. Thus, for example, a program established to

provide benefits solely to the children of members of the governing body of the Tribe

(unless the Tribe is a general council Tribe) and thus defrays costs otherwise borne by

members of the governing body would fail to satisfy the non-discrimination requirement.

D. No limitation on source of funds

       Section 139E does not provide restrictions on how an Indian Tribal government

may fund an Indian Tribal government program. Section 2.03 of Revenue Procedure

2014-35 provides that revenues that the Indian Tribal government derives from levies,

taxes, service fees, tribally-owned businesses, or other sources are permissible to fund

a Tribal general welfare program.

       The TTAC Report and the Tribal Comments argue that the source of funds used

for general welfare benefits does not matter for compliance with section 139E. The

TTAC Report and the Tribal Comments request that the proposed regulations confirm

that the source of funding is irrelevant and, in particular, that a Tribe’s gaming revenues

may be used to fund Tribal general welfare benefits under an Indian Tribal government

program.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS agree with the TTAC Report and the

Tribal Comments that section 139E does not prohibit an Indian Tribal government from

funding a general welfare program with net gaming revenues, or revenues from any

other particular source. Thus, proposed §1.139E-1(c)(5) would provide that benefits

under the Indian Tribal government program may be funded by any source of revenue

or funds, including net gaming revenues. However, an Indian Tribal government is

permitted to restrict the source and amount of funds available to provide benefits under

an Indian Tribal government program.

E. Benefits funded by net gaming revenues

       Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. 2701-2721 (IGRA), a
Federally-recognized Tribe is permitted to engage in gaming activities and provide

net gaming revenues to its members. See 25 U.S.C. 2710(b). Section 25 CFR

502.16 defines “net gaming revenue” as gross gaming revenues of an “Indian

gaming operation” less: (a) amounts paid out as, or paid for, prizes; and (b) total

gaming-related operating expenses, including all those expenses of the gaming

operation commonly known as operating expenses and non-operating expenses

consistent with professional accounting pronouncements, excluding management

fees. IGRA allows Tribes to use their net gaming revenues consistent with one or

more of the following purposes: (1) to fund Tribal government operations or programs;

(2) to provide for the general welfare of the Tribe or its members; (3) to promote Tribal

economic development; (4) to donate to charitable organizations; or (5) to help fund

operations of local government.

       IGRA also allows Tribes to use their net gaming revenues to distribute per

capita payments. See 25 U.S.C. 2710(b)(3). Under 25 CFR 290.2, “per capita

payment” means the distribution of money or other thing of value to all members of the

Tribe, or to identified groups of members, which is paid directly from the net revenues of

any Tribal gaming activity, but does not include payments that have been set aside by a

Tribe for special purposes or programs, such as payments made for social welfare,

medical assistance, education, housing, or other similar, specifically identified needs.

       Under IGRA, a Tribe cannot distribute per capita payments unless it has a

Revenue Allocation Plan (RAP) that is approved by the DOI prior to distributing per

capita payments. See 25 U.S.C. 2710(b)(3) and 25 CFR 290.11. A Tribe does not

need a RAP if no per capita payments are made or planned to be made to its

members. See 25 CFR 290.10. Thus, no RAP is required if a Tribe intends to use

its gaming revenues solely for special purposes or programs, such as payments made

for social welfare, medical assistance, education, housing, or other similar, specifically
identified needs. These types of payments are not per capita payments as defined

under IGRA.

       Section 25 U.S.C. 2710(b)(3)(D) provides that net revenues may be used to

make per capita payments to members of the Tribe only if the per capita payments

are subject to Federal taxation and Tribes notify members of such tax liability when

payments are made. Under section 6041 and §1.6041-1, the Tribe generally is

required to report per capita payments of $600 or more in any taxable year on Form

1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Information.

       Section 3402(r)(1) requires every person, including an Indian Tribe, making a

payment to a member of an Indian Tribe from the net revenues of any class II or class

III gaming activity conducted or licensed by such tribe to deduct and withhold from such

payment a tax in an amount equal to such payment's proportionate share of the

annualized tax. A payment that constitutes a per capita payment under IGRA is gross

income under section 61 and continues to be subject to withholding under section

3402(r)(1) to the extent not otherwise excepted. See 25 U.S.C. 2701-2721 and 25 CFR

part 290. These provisions, which are intended to ensure adequate withholding on

gross income arising from the distribution of class II and class III gaming activity, are not

intended to and do not extend the scope of what is gross income. Thus, withholding

under section 3402(r) is not imposed merely by reason of the payment being sourced in

class II or class III gaming activities but rather by reason of the payment being gross

income and made in the form described in section 3402(r). Accordingly, if a payment is

made under an Indian Tribal government program and meets the requirements to

qualify as an excludable Tribal general welfare benefit under section 139E and these

proposed regulations, then such payment is not subject to the withholding requirements

of section 3402(r).

       Section 139E does not address IGRA or the Federal tax treatment of per capita
payments. Revenue Procedure 2014-35, however, specifically provides that per capita

payments are gross income under section 61, and are subject to the information

reporting and withholding requirements of sections 6041 and 3402(r). Thus, under the

revenue procedure, per capita payments are not excludable from income under the

administrative general welfare exclusion.

      The TTAC Report argues that a distribution with a general welfare purpose under

IGRA should be presumed to be a Tribal general welfare benefit under section 139E

and not be treated as a taxable per capita payment under IGRA. In addition, the TTAC

Report provides that a Tribe’s RAP should be relied upon when determining whether a

payment is a per capita payment or a general welfare payment under section 139E.

Finally, the TTAC Report states that the IRS should not be allowed to challenge an

approved RAP with respect to any perceived conflict with IGRA and section 139E.

Rather, the TTAC Report argues, the IRS must engage in consultation with the Tribe to

resolve the perceived conflict. Finally, the TTAC Report requests that any enforcement

by the IRS contrary to the RAP be prospective only, and that Tribes be given time to

amend their RAPs with the DOI.

      Some Tribal Comments argue that IGRA makes clear that not all equal

distributions of gaming revenue are necessarily “per capita payments” to the extent that

they are set aside for social welfare, medical assistance, education, housing, or similar

purposes. Some Tribal Comments recommend that the proposed regulations focus on

the purpose and methodology used to calculate the distributions, rather than the source

of the funding or the value of the benefit. Finally, some Tribal Comments request that

the IRS defer to a Tribe’s RAP and not recharacterize general welfare payments as per

capita payments.

      The Treasury Department and the IRS are of the view that IGRA defines per

capita payments and provides that those payments are includible in gross income for
Federal income tax purposes. However, the Treasury Department and the IRS agree

with the TTAC Report and the Tribal Comments noting that IGRA distinguishes between

taxable per capita payments and other types of payments, such as general welfare

payments. The Treasury Department and the IRS also are of the view that Indian Tribal

governments are in the best position to determine whether net gaming revenues should

be used to fund per capita payments or general welfare payments.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS do not agree with the TTAC Report that a

distribution with a general welfare purpose under IGRA should be presumed to be a

Tribal general welfare benefit under section 139E. Even if a payment is treated as

having a general welfare purpose under IGRA, as designated in a RAP or otherwise,

that purpose, by itself, is not sufficient to conclude that the payment is excludable from

gross income under section 139E. Instead, the Indian Tribal government program must

satisfy the requirements of section 139E (or other exclusion provision) for the payment

to be excluded from the recipient’s gross income.

       Accordingly, proposed §1.139E-1(c)(5)(ii) would provide that benefits under the

Indian Tribal government program may be funded by net gaming revenues as permitted

under IGRA. However, per capita payments, as defined under IGRA, are subject to

Federal taxation under IGRA and are not excludable from gross income under section

139E or these proposed regulations. Proposed §1.139E-1(c)(5)(ii) would further provide

that, for purposes of section 139E and the proposed regulations, a payment is a per

capita payment if it is identified by the Indian Tribal government as a per capita payment

in a RAP that is approved by the DOI. This language is intended to mean that, if the

Indian Tribal government has an approved RAP, the provisions of the RAP determine

whether a payment is a per capita payment for purposes of Federal income taxation. In

contrast, if the Indian Tribal government does not have a RAP, the determination of the

Indian Tribal government that payments are not per capita payments is controlling for
Federal income tax purposes. Whether or not the Indian Tribal government has a RAP,

deference will be given to the Indian Tribal government’s determination of whether net

gaming revenues are being used to make payments. The DOI is the Federal agency

with sole authority to approve the use of net gaming revenues by an Indian Tribal

government, including whether per capita payments may be made under a RAP.

       In drafting these proposed regulations, the Treasury Department and the IRS

have considered recent litigation addressing per capita payments made by one Tribe to

its members. In United States v. Jim, 891 F.3d 1242 (2018), the 11th Circuit affirmed

the district court’s conclusion that section 139E did not apply to exclude per capita

payments from a Tribal member’s gross income. The court held that per capita

payments are taxable under IGRA, a specific statute addressing Tribal net gaming

revenues. The court also held that section 139E, a more general statute, does not

control or nullify IGRA. The Treasury Department and the IRS agree that section 139E

does not control or nullify IGRA, and that per capita payments under IGRA cannot be

excluded from gross income under section 139E. However, as noted in parts II.D and

III.A.3 of this Explanation of Provisions, there is no prohibition in section 139E on Tribal

general welfare benefits being paid from net gaming revenues, nor is there is a

prohibition on Tribal general welfare benefits being paid in equal amounts to Tribal

members. Thus, an Indian Tribal government may use net gaming revenues to provide

benefits, whether or not uniform, to Tribal members. Further, those benefits may be

excluded from gross income as Tribal general welfare benefits if (1) they are not

designated, including under a RAP, as per capita payments by the Indian Tribal

government, and (2) they otherwise meet the requirements in section 139E. For

example, to be an excludable Tribal general welfare benefit, the benefit cannot be lavish

or extravagant and must be provided under a program that is established by the Indian

Tribal government and administered under specified guidelines.
III. Tribal General Welfare Benefits

       Under section 139E(b), benefits provided under an Indian Tribal government

program are Tribal general welfare benefits only if the benefits (1) are for the promotion

of general welfare; (2) are available to any Tribal member who meets the guidelines;

(3) are not lavish or extravagant; and (4) are not compensation for services. Proposed

§1.139E-1(d) would describe each of these requirements.

A. Benefits must be for the promotion of general welfare

1. Deference to Tribes in Determining Promotion of General Welfare

       Section 139E(b)(2)(B) requires that a benefit provided under an Indian Tribal

government program be for the promotion of general welfare but does not define

“promotion of general welfare.” The TTAC Report recommends that promotion of

general welfare should be presumed when the Indian Tribal government can

substantiate that the benefit meets general welfare needs or purpose, and the method

of distributing the benefit is expected to achieve program goals. Further, the TTAC

Report states that an Indian Tribal government may substantiate that benefits meet

general welfare needs or purposes by relying on data or studies corroborating the

expenses. In addition, the TTAC Report recommends that an Indian Tribal government

may show that the method of distribution is expected to achieve program goals by

establishing Indian Tribal government-approved verification procedures such as direct

pay arrangements, applications in which recipients agree to specified program

requirements, or end-of-year certifications. Finally, the TTAC Report states that Indian

Tribal governments must be afforded flexibility with regard to substantiating expenses

that relate to Tribal cultural traditions, religious expenses, or historical need (such as

benefits paid to elders to make up for historic economic deprivation and shorter life

expectancy).

       Many Tribal Comments request that deference be given to Tribes and Indian
Tribal governments on whether the types and amounts of benefits are for the promotion

of general welfare. These Tribal Comments state that the Indian Tribal government is

best suited to address the unique needs of its members, with many insisting that such

discretion should be unfettered. The Tribal Comments noted that many programs may

not reflect how the Treasury Department and the IRS would traditionally view general

welfare, including benefits such as wellness centers, health coaches, and access to

dieticians.

       Other Tribal Comments state that an official determination by the Indian Tribal

government, such as a Tribal resolution or other formal action, should be sufficient to

demonstrate that a benefit or program is for the promotion of general welfare. With

respect to benefits provided, some Tribal Comments request that the regulations defer

to Indian Tribal governments on determining whether benefits provided to Tribal

members are considered “for the promotion of general welfare,” particularly when the

Indian Tribal government relies on its own data or other empirical data (for example,

private studies, or based on Federal or state statistics). Many Tribal Comments argue

that the Treasury Department and the IRS should avoid listing specific criteria required

for a benefit to satisfy the promotion of general welfare requirement.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS agree with the TTAC Report and the

Tribal Comments that deference should be given to the Indian Tribal government in

determining whether a benefit is for the promotion of the general welfare of its Tribal

members or other eligible individuals. The Indian Tribal government is in the best

position to determine which general welfare benefits are best suited to meet the needs

of its Tribal members and other eligible individuals. As a result, these proposed

regulations would not define the term “for the promotion of general welfare” or

specifically provide requirements that a benefit must meet in order to satisfy section

139E(b)(2)(B). Instead, proposed §1.139E-1(d)(2) would provide deference to the
Indian Tribal government to determine, at the time the program is established, whether

a benefit is for the promotion of general welfare of its Tribal members or other eligible

individuals. Proposed §1.139E-1(d)(2) would provide further that an Indian Tribal

Government has sole discretion to determine whether a benefit is for the promotion of

general welfare and that the IRS will defer to the Indian Tribal Government’s

determination that a benefit is for the promotion of general welfare. These proposed

rules would be consistent with the specific language in section 2(c) of the Act, which

requires that deference be given to Indian Tribal governments for the programs

administered and authorized by the Tribe to benefit the general welfare of the Tribal

community.

2. No Need Requirement

       The administrative general welfare exclusion requires that payments be for the

promotion of general welfare, which the IRS has interpreted to require a showing of

individual or family need, notably financial need. This interpretation generally applies

regardless of whether the benefits are provided by a Federal, State, or local government

or by an Indian Tribal government. However, Revenue Procedure 2014-35 provides

that the individual need criterion of the administrative general welfare exclusion is

presumed to be met for certain benefits provided under an Indian Tribal government

program. Section 139E(b)(2)(B) requires that a benefit be for the promotion of general

welfare but does not specifically define that term nor mention whether it incorporates a

needs-based requirement.

       The TTAC Report and majority of the Tribal Comments contend that the

proposed regulations should not incorporate a needs-based requirement for the

promotion of general welfare requirement in section 139E(b). The Tribal Comments

note that section 139E is silent on an individual need requirement. Also, the Tribal

Comments point to the language in Revenue Procedure 2014-35, which conclusively
presumed individual need was satisfied, as support for not including a requirement for

the showing of individual need in section 139E.

       As noted in part III.A.1 of this Explanation of Provisions, proposed §1.139E-

1(d)(2) would provide that an Indian Tribal Government has sole discretion to determine

whether a benefit is for the promotion of general welfare and that the IRS will defer to

the Indian Tribal Government’s determination that a benefit is for the promotion of

general welfare. Consistent with this approach, Indian Tribal Governments thus would

have sole discretion as to whether to consider individual need or not in designing a

general welfare program. In addition, the Treasury Department and the IRS agree with

the TTAC Report and the Tribal Comments that section 139E was intended by

Congress to generally codify Revenue Procedure 2014-35, which conclusively

presumed that individual need was satisfied if the program met certain requirements.

This conclusion is also consistent with the legislative history of section 139E. See

House Debate, at H7601 (Representative Devin Nunes stating “that the IRS will not

interpret the statute as requiring individualized determinations of financial need where a

tribal government has established a program consistent with the statute”); see also

Senate Colloquy, at S5686 (Senator Jerry Moran asking Senator Ron Wyden, and

Senator Wyden agreeing, that the IRS will “in no event require an individualized

determination of financial need” if a Tribal program meets the other requirements of

section 139E).

       Accordingly, proposed §1.139E-1(d)(2) specifically states that Tribal general

welfare benefits may be provided without regard to the financial or other need of Tribal

program participants. However, Indian Tribal governments have broad discretion to

establish and administer general welfare programs and may choose to limit a program

or its benefits to Tribal program participants based on a showing of individual need.

3. Benefits may be in Equal Amounts
        Section 139E does not address whether Tribal general welfare benefits may be

provided to recipients in equal amounts. However, in considering the enactment of

section 139E, Representative Nunes expressed an intent that section 139E apply to pro

rata payments. In addressing the IRS’s frequent insistence that Tribal benefits be

based on a stipulation based on individualized financial need, he stated, “This

stipulation prevents the general welfare exclusion from covering programs designed to

provide substantially equal benefits to all qualifying members of a tribe or to provide

benefits based on determinations of needs that are not financial in nature.” See House

Debate, at H7601. Revenue Procedure 2014-35 does not directly address this issue of

whether general welfare benefits under its safe harbors could be provided equally to all

eligible individuals, but states that per capita payments to Tribal members of Tribal

gaming revenues that are subject to IGRA are gross income under section 61, are

subject to the information reporting and withholding requirements of sections 6041 and

3402(r), and are not excludable from gross income.

        The TTAC Report correctly notes that section 139E does not prohibit general

welfare benefits from being distributed in uniform amounts. The Tribal Comments

recommend that the Treasury Department and the IRS defer to Tribes in determining

whether pro rata payments (that is, uniform payments to each recipient) are appropriate.

In general, several Tribal Comments, when referring to net gaming revenues under

IGRA, argue that IGRA does not treat all pro rata payments as taxable, but instead

looks to the purpose and methodology used to calculate the payments.4 The Tribal

Comments also request that the proposed regulations permit pro rata payments under

an Indian Tribal government program, as several Tribal Comments emphasized that

distributing benefits in equal amounts is often the most efficient method to provide



4 See part II.E. of this Explanation of Provisions for a fuller discussion of IGRA and general welfare

payments made from net gaming revenues.
benefits, such as for health and wellness and broadband internet access.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS agree with the TTAC Report and the

Tribal Comments that section 139E does not prohibit an Indian Tribal government

program from providing Tribal general welfare benefits to recipients in equal amounts.

Accordingly, proposed §1.139E-1(d)(2) would provide that Tribal general welfare

benefits may be provided on a uniform or pro-rata basis to Tribal program participants.

4. Specific Types of Benefits

       The TTAC Report and the Tribal Comments recommend clarification on whether

payment of benefits for disaster relief and similar assistance qualify under section 139E.

In addition, both the TTAC Report and many Tribal Comments request that an Indian

Tribal government disaster declaration qualify to establish the existence of a disaster for

purposes of identifying relief payments under section 139E.

       Section 139 generally provides an exclusion from gross income for qualified

disaster relief payments. Qualified disaster relief payments generally include certain

amounts paid to or for the benefit of an individual in connection with a qualified disaster,

including a Federally declared disaster. Specifically, section 139(b)(4) includes as a

qualified disaster relief payment an amount paid by a Federal, State, or local

government, or agency or instrumentality thereof, in connection with a qualified

disaster in order to promote the general welfare. Section 139(b)(4) was enacted to

codify the administrative general welfare exclusion for certain disaster relief payments,

but does not supplant it. See Notice 2002-76 (2002-2 C.B. 917). Thus, benefits paid by

Indian Tribal governments to individuals affected by a disaster may be excluded from

the individuals’ gross income if the requirements of the administrative general welfare

exclusion are met. Similarly, these disaster relief benefits may be excluded from gross

income if they qualify as Tribal general welfare benefits under section 139E.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS recognize that Indian Tribal governments
have broad discretion to provide benefits to individuals who are affected by a disaster or

other emergency situation that does not meet the requirements of a qualified disaster

under section 139. Thus, proposed §1.139E-1(d)(2) would include as a permissible

general welfare purpose “assistance for disasters or emergency situations.” The Indian

Tribal government need not make a specific Tribal disaster declaration.

       In addition, the TTAC Report requests that the proposed regulations specifically

provide that wellness and health-related programs may be Tribal general welfare

benefits. The TTAC Report acknowledges that section 139D applies to certain health

care expenses but requests clarification that section 139E operates independent of, and

is not limited by, section 139D of the Code. In particular, the concern is that wellness

and health-related programs may not fall within the section 139D exclusion.

       Section 139D generally provides an exclusion from gross income for any

qualified Indian health care benefit. Qualified Indian health care benefits include

medical care provided by an Indian Tribe or Tribal organization, or coverage under

insurance or a plan provided by an Indian Tribe or Tribal organization for medical care.

See section 139D(b)(2)-(4). For purposes of section 139D, “medical care” has the

same meaning as when used in section 213 of the Code. Amounts paid for benefits

that are merely beneficial to the general health of an individual, such as certain wellness

and health-related programs, as well as care by an unlicensed spouse or relative, are

not amounts paid for medical care and thus are not excluded under section 139D. See

section 213(d) and §1.213-1(e)(1)(ii).

       The Treasury Department and the IRS agree that section 139E operates

independently of, and is not limited by, section 139D. Thus, in accordance with the

deference provided to Indian Tribal Governments in proposed §1.139E-1(d)(2), an

Indian Tribal Government may determine that wellness and health-related programs are

for the promotion of general welfare under section 139E.
B. Benefits must be available to any Tribal program participant

       Section 139E(b)(2) provides, in relevant part, that a benefit provided under the

program must be available to any Tribal member who meets the specified guidelines of

the program. Revenue Procedure 2014-35 requires that the benefit be available to any

eligible individual who satisfies the program guidelines, subject to budgetary constraints.

The TTAC Report and the Tribal Comments do not specifically address this

requirement.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that this requirement

should be interpreted in a manner similar to Revenue Procedure 2014-35. Thus,

proposed §1.139E-1(d)(3) would provide that a benefit under the Indian Tribal

government program must be available to any Tribal program participant who meets the

specified guidelines of the program, subject to budgetary constraints.

C. Benefits cannot be lavish or extravagant

       Section 139E(b)(2) provides, in relevant part, that benefits provided under the

program cannot be lavish or extravagant. Section 139E(c)(3) provides that the

Secretary, in consultation with the TTAC, must establish guidelines for what constitutes

lavish or extravagant benefits with respect to Indian Tribal government programs. The

Treasury Department and the IRS have consulted with the TTAC during the drafting of

these proposed regulations. In addition, the Treasury Department and the IRS will hold

Tribal consultation before finalizing the proposed regulations.

       Like section 139E, Revenue Procedure 2014-35 prohibits benefits that are lavish

or extravagant. It does not define “lavish or extravagant” but does provide that the

benefits cannot be “lavish or extravagant under the facts and circumstances.”

       The TTAC Report recommends that the term “lavish or extravagant” be defined

as a relative term that depends on the unique circumstances of the Tribe, and also

depends on the type of benefit being provided (such as, one-time payment or monthly
assistance). The TTAC Report sets forth a non-exclusive list of circumstances that

should be considered when determining if a benefit is lavish or extravagant: an Indian

Tribal government’s economic circumstances or factors, culture and cultural practices,

history, geographic area, traditions, and resources. The TTAC Report recommends

deference to Indian Tribal governments and proposes a rebuttable presumption that the

benefit is not lavish or extravagant if the Indian Tribal government program meets

general welfare needs or purposes, and the method of distribution is expected to

achieve program goals.

       Several Tribal Comments recommend that the proposed regulations defer to the

Tribes or their Indian Tribal governments for determining whether a benefit is lavish or

extravagant. Most Tribal Comments provide that the term is relative and depends on

the unique circumstances of each Tribe and the type of benefit provided. Some Tribal

Comments recommend deference to an Indian Tribal government’s definition of lavish

or extravagant as established by official actions, such as Tribal ordinances, resolutions,

and policies. In addition, some Tribal Comments propose that a facts and

circumstances standard, similar to Revenue Procedure 2014-35, be applied to define

lavish or extravagant. Under such a standard, a benefit would not be lavish or

extravagant if based upon a particular Tribe’s political, socio-economic and cultural facts

and circumstances as determined by that Tribe. Some Tribal Comments argue that the

definition should be subject to the Tribal canon, as opposed to the traditional canons of

statutory construction, and that any ambiguity be construed in favor of the Tribe.

       Some Tribal Comments describe what the proposed regulations should not do

when defining lavish or extravagant. For example, some Tribal Comments urge that the

proposed regulations should define lavish or extravagant in a way that targets egregious

abuse but otherwise does not affect Indian Tribal government programs that are

designed and administered in good faith. Other Tribal Comments suggest that the term
lavish or extravagant not be defined by reference to dollar amounts, and specifically

highlighted cost of living variations (for example, geographic differences). Some Tribal

Comments emphasize that the proposed regulations should not use examples that may

suggest limitations on the eligibility of program benefits. Specifically, these commenters

suggest that it would be more helpful to include examples of benefits that are not

considered lavish or extravagant. Finally, some Tribal Comments argue that the

Treasury Department and the IRS should not refer to other Code provisions for

guidance on interpreting the phrase “lavish or extravagant” under section 139E.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS generally agree with the TTAC Report

and the Tribal Comments. Accordingly, proposed §1.139E-1(d)(4) would provide a facts

and circumstances test to determine whether a Tribal general welfare benefit is lavish or

extravagant under section 139E. Under proposed §1.139E-1(d)(4), whether a benefit is

lavish or extravagant would be based on the facts and circumstances at the time the

benefit is provided. Relevant facts and circumstances would include a Tribe’s culture

and cultural practices, history, geographic area, traditions, resources, and economic

conditions or factors. A facts and circumstances test is consistent with Revenue

Procedure 2014-35, as well as the TTAC Report and the Tribal Comments suggesting

that the Tribe’s unique circumstances should be considered when evaluating whether

the Indian Tribal government determined a Tribal general welfare benefit to be lavish or

extravagant at the time the benefit is provided. However, proposed §1.139E-1(d)(4)

also would provide a presumption that a benefit is not lavish or extravagant if it is

described in, and provided in accordance with, the written specified guidelines of the

Indian Tribal government program.

       The TTAC Report and some Tribal Comments mention that the frequency of

benefit (for example, lump sum or monthly payment) should be considered when

evaluating whether a program’s benefit is lavish or extravagant. The Treasury
Department and the IRS agree that the frequency of payment should be considered

when determining whether a Tribal general welfare benefit is lavish or extravagant.

Under a facts and circumstances test, an Indian Tribal government may establish a

program that provides the types of benefits, including frequency of payment, that best

meet the needs of its Tribal members.

D. Benefits cannot be compensation for services

        Section 139E(b)(2)(D) provides that a Tribal general welfare benefit paid under

an Indian Tribal government program cannot be compensation for services, with

exceptions discussed in part IV of this Explanation of Provisions.5 Section

139E(b)(2)(D) does not provide a specific definition for the term compensation for

services for purposes of section 139E. Revenue Procedure 2014-35 also provides that

benefits under the safe harbors cannot be compensation for services but does not

specifically define compensation for services. The prohibition on compensation for

services is a long-standing core principle of the administrative general welfare

exclusion. See Revenue Ruling 75-246 (1975-1 C.B. 24).

        The TTAC Report acknowledges that section 139E prohibits compensation for

services from being treated as Tribal general welfare benefits. The TTAC Report and

the Tribal Comments do not recommend a specific definition of compensation for

services, but the TTAC Report recommends that the proposed regulations confirm that

(1) a benefit in connection with Tribal custom or tradition regarding community service is

not compensation for services; (2) compensation for services does not include cultural

or ceremonial gifts and payments, as determined by the Tribe; and (3) payments as part

of training programs are not compensation for services. Similar to this third issue, one




5 Section 139E(c)(5) provides an exception under which any items of cultural significance, reimbursement

of costs, or cash honorarium for participation in cultural or ceremonial activities for the transmission of
Tribal culture “shall not be treated as compensation for services.” This exception to the general
prohibition on compensation for services is addressed in part IV of this Explanation of Provisions.
Tribal Comment argues that on-the-job training, apprenticeships, and other classes for

job skills for which participants receive payment should not be treated as compensation

for services. Finally, one Tribal Comment argues that the rule in section 139E(b)(2)(D)

should be read narrowly to cover services that are traditionally provided under an

employment or contracted-vendor relationship.

       The first two issues raised in the TTAC Report overlap with the rules in section

139E(c)(5), which provides that certain benefits provided for participation in cultural or

ceremonial activities are not treated as compensation for services. These issues from

the TTAC Report are addressed in part IV of this Explanation of Provisions. The third

issue, relating to whether payments made to individuals in various types of training

programs are compensation for services, is addressed under section 61 and current law

relating to gross income generally.

       Section 61(a) generally provides that, except as otherwise provided in the Code,

gross income means all income from whatever source derived, and this includes

compensation for services, including fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and similar

items, whether paid in money or property. Section 1.61-2(a)(1) of the Income Tax

Regulations provides additional examples of payments that are included in gross

income because they are compensation for services, such as wages, salaries, and

commissions paid salesmen. However, compensation for services also includes

amounts that are not paid in an employment or contracted-vendor relationship. Thus,

the proposed regulations do not adopt the Tribal Comment arguing that compensation

for services should be read narrowly to cover only services that are traditionally

provided under an employment or contracted-vendor relationship.

       In the context of training, apprenticeships, and other skills training programs,

existing IRS guidance on the administrative general welfare exclusion provides

assistance on how to distinguish whether a payment is a general welfare payment or is
compensation for services. See Revenue Ruling 63-136 (1963-2 C.B. 19) (excluding

from income the payments for on-the-job career training or retraining where such

payments are “intended to aid the recipients in their efforts to acquire new skills that

would enable them to obtain better employment opportunities”); Revenue Ruling 65-139

(1965-1 C.B. 31) (as clarified by Revenue Ruling 66-240 (1966-2 C.B. 19)). In general,

the determination as to whether payments under training programs are includible in a

participant’s gross income rests on whether the activity for which the payments are

received is in exchange for the performance of services (compensation for services) or

is for participation in a training program that promotes the general welfare (general

welfare payment). Revenue Ruling 75-246 (1975-1 C.B. 24).

       Because existing guidance addresses the long-standing distinction between

compensation for services and general welfare payments, the Treasury Department and

the IRS have determined that the proposed regulations should define compensation for

services by reference to current law. Thus, proposed §1.139E-1(d)(5) would define the

term compensation for services by referring to the rules in section 61(a). These rules

encompass all the regulations and other IRS guidance under section 61(a) that interpret

the meaning of compensation for services.

IV. Exception to Prohibition on Compensation for Services

       As noted in part III.D. of this Explanation of Provisions, section 139E(b)(2)(D)

generally provides that a Tribal general welfare benefit cannot be compensation for

services. However, section 139E(c)(5) contains an exception to that general rule and

provides that any items of cultural significance, reimbursement of costs, or cash

honorarium for participation in cultural or ceremonial activities for the transmission of

Tribal culture will not be treated as compensation for services. Accordingly, such items

may, if the other requirements of section 139E are satisfied, be Tribal general welfare

benefits that are excluded from gross income.
       Revenue Procedure 2014-35 contains a similar exception. Specifically, section

5.03 of the revenue procedure provides that the safe harbors apply to “benefits provided

under an Indian Tribal governmental program that are items of cultural significance that

are not lavish or extravagant under the facts and circumstances, or nominal cash

honoraria provided to religious or spiritual officials or leaders. . . to recognize their

participation in cultural, religious, and social events.”

A. Participation in cultural or ceremonial activities

       The exception in section 139E(c)(5) applies only if specific benefits are “for

participation in cultural or ceremonial activities for the transmission of tribal culture.”

Revenue Procedure 2014-35 contains a similar exception, but that exception is limited

to specific benefits “provided to religious or spiritual officials or leaders (including but not

limited to medicine men, medicine women, and shamans) to recognize their

participation in cultural, religious, and social events (including but not limited to pow-

wows [sic], rite of passage ceremonies, funerals, wakes, burials, other bereavement

events, and honoring events).” As the TTAC Report points out, Revenue Procedure

2014-35 refers only to event participation by religious or spiritual leaders and does not

describe larger Indian Tribal-wide cultural, ceremonial, and community service general

welfare programs. The TTAC Report recommends that the proposed regulations

provide that the IRS must defer to Tribal determinations on what it means to participate

in cultural or ceremonial activities for the transmission of Tribal culture. Some Tribal

Comments request that the exclusion apply to attendance at Tribal gatherings and

participation in community service or tribal meetings. Some Tribal Comments provide

examples of services that should not be considered compensation for services, such as

blessings provided by Tribal members, preparation of traditional foods at events,

support for sponsoring Tribal events, and the activities of traditional healers performed

at or for official Tribal events like ceremonial or traditional gatherings. Finally, some
Tribal Comments state that the proposed regulations should apply the section

139E(c)(5) exception to services that are traditionally provided through employment or

contracted-vendor arrangements.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS recognize that the language in section

139E(c)(5) is broader than Revenue Procedure 2014-35 in that the section 139E(c)(5)

exception is not limited to religious or spiritual officials or leaders. The Treasury

Department and the IRS also agree with the TTAC Report that Tribes are in the best

position to determine what it means to participate in cultural or ceremonial activities for

the transmission of Tribal culture. Thus, proposed §1.139E-1(e) would provide that the

Indian Tribal government determines what it means to participate in cultural or

ceremonial activities for the transmission of Tribal culture and would include the list of

examples from Revenue Procedure 2014-35 (powwows, rite of passage ceremonies,

funerals, wakes, burials, other bereavement events, and honoring events). It would

further provide that the IRS will defer to the Indian Tribal government’s determination of

whether an activity is a cultural or ceremonial activity for the transmission of Tribal

culture.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS do not agree with the Tribal Comments

stating that the exception in section 139E(c)(5) broadly applies to services that are

traditionally provided under an employment or contracted-vendor relationship because

section 139E is an exclusion from gross income for individuals and families, not

businesses. For example, a corporation owned by a Tribal member that contracts with

the Indian Tribal government to cater a Tribal ceremony is not within the section

139E(c)(5) exception. In this case, any payment received by the corporation from the

Tribe to provide catered food at a Tribal ceremony is business income. However, a

Tribal member that volunteers to make traditional foods for a Tribal ceremony and

receives an item of cultural significance, cash honorarium, or reimbursement of costs is
within the exception of section 139E(c)(5).

B. Items of cultural significance

       Section 139E(c)(5) provides, in part, that “items of cultural significance” that are

provided for participation in cultural or ceremonial activities for the transmission of Tribal

culture are not treated as compensation for services. Revenue Procedure 2014-35 also

contains an exception for items of cultural significance that are not lavish or extravagant

under the facts and circumstances. The term “items of cultural significance” is not

defined in section 139E or in Revenue Procedure 2014-35. The TTAC Report and the

Tribal Comments recommend that deference should be given to Indian Tribal

governments and Tribes to determine what are items of cultural significance for their

Tribe. One Tribal Comment provides a list of examples of items with cultural

significance, including blankets, cash, food, regalia items, fabric, beads, drums, pelts,

feathers, artwork, baskets, clothing, household items, tobacco, gift cards, animals, and

vehicles.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS agree that Indian Tribal governments are

in the best position to determine items of cultural significance. Thus, proposed

§1.139E-1(e)(2) would provide that the Indian Tribal government determines items of

cultural significance and that the IRS will defer to the Indian Tribal government’s

determination. Unlike the similar rule in Revenue Procedure 2014-35, the proposed

regulations would not limit the items of cultural significance to those that are not lavish

or extravagant. However, the prohibition on lavish or extravagant benefits in proposed

§1.139E-1(d)(4) would apply broadly to all Tribal general welfare benefits, including

those that are provided under section 139E(c)(5) for participation in cultural or

ceremonial activities. In addition, the Treasury Department and the IRS do not view

cash, gift cards, or vehicles themselves as items with cultural significance, although

such items may be used to reimburse costs for participation in cultural or ceremonial
activities without being considered compensation for services.

C. Cash honorarium

       Section 139E(c)(5) provides, in part, that cash honoraria provided for

participation in cultural or ceremonial activities for the transmission of Tribal culture is

not treated as compensation for services. Revenue Procedure 2014-35 contains a

similar exception, although it is limited to nominal cash honoraria. The term “cash

honoraria” is not defined in section 139E or in Revenue Procedure 2014-35. The TTAC

Report and the Tribal Comments request that the proposed regulations recognize

Congress’s decision to eliminate the qualifier that honoraria be “nominal” and provide

that a Tribe’s determination of the proper amount of the honorarium should be

presumed to be reasonable and fair.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS agree with the TTAC Report and the

Tribal Comments that section 139E is broader than Revenue Procedure 2014-35 by not

limiting the exception to the compensation for services requirement to nominal cash

honoraria. Thus, proposed §1.139E-1(e) would not provide that the compensation for

services exception in section 139E(c)(5) is limited to nominal cash honoraria.

D. Reimbursement of costs

       Section 139E(c)(5) provides, in part, that reimbursement of costs provided for

participation in cultural or ceremonial activities for the transmission of Tribal culture is

not treated as compensation for services. Revenue Procedure 2014-35 does not

contain a similar exception. Section 139E(c)(5) does not define the term

“reimbursement of costs.” However, the Treasury Department and the IRS expect that

the usual usage of the term applies for purposes of section 139E. Thus, the

reimbursement of costs generally would include amounts paid by the Indian Tribal

government to an individual to reimburse specific amounts paid by the individual to

participate in the cultural or ceremonial activity.
E. Members of other Tribes

       As noted in part I.D. of this Explanation of Provisions, the proposed regulations

generally would define the term Tribal member to mean a member of the Tribe that

establishes or maintains the Indian Tribal government program. Some Tribal

Comments highlight that some Tribes may provide benefits to individuals who are Tribal

members of a different Tribe than the one establishing the general welfare program.

For example, an Indian Tribal government may provide benefits to a cultural, spiritual, or

ceremonial leader of another Tribe who teaches shared Tribal cultural practices or

ceremonial functions.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS agree that, solely for purposes of the

exception in section 139E(c)(5) relating to benefits provided for participation in

ceremonial or cultural activities, the recipient may be a member of a Tribe that is

different from the Tribe that establishes or maintains the program. Thus, proposed

§1.139E-1(b)(8)(ii) would provide that, solely for purposes of proposed §1.139E-1(e),

the definition of Tribal program participant may include a member of a Tribe that is

different from the Tribe that establishes the Indian Tribal government program and

provides the Tribal general welfare benefit. For example, if a cultural leader from one

Tribe performs at another Tribe’s powwow, a cash honorarium given to the cultural

leader is not compensation for services under section 139E(c)(5).

V. Issues Not Addressed in Proposed Regulations

A. Interaction with other Federal programs

       The TTAC Report requests that the proposed regulations provide that individual

need be presumed for all Tribal general welfare benefits that meet the requirements of

section 139E. Moreover, the TTAC Report and many Tribal Comments request that the

Treasury Department and the IRS coordinate with other Federal agencies, including the

Social Security Administration, to ensure that Tribal general welfare benefits are not
treated as income or a disqualifying resource for purposes of program eligibility, such as

supplemental security income benefits under 42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS have authority to interpret and provide

rules under section 139E to determine whether a benefit is excludible from gross

income for Federal income tax purposes. However, the issue of whether a Tribal

general welfare benefit is taken into account for purposes of determining other Federal

benefits is outside the authority of the Treasury Department and the IRS, and therefore

beyond the scope of these proposed regulations. The Treasury Department and the

IRS are willing to work with the TTAC and Tribes to confer with other Federal agencies

and provide advice on how the Federal tax law applies to Tribal general welfare

benefits.

B. Grants to Indian-owned enterprises

       The TTAC Report requests that the proposed regulations provide that grants to

establish or expand Indian-owned enterprises are excludible from gross income under

section 139E. The TTAC Report cites Revenue Ruling 77-77 (1977-1 C.B. 11), for the

proposition that non-reimbursable grants made under the Indian Financing Act of 1974

to Indians to expand profit-making Indian-owned economic enterprises on or near

reservations are excludable from gross income under the administrative general welfare

exclusion. The TTAC Report also requests that the guidance clarify that “expanding” a

business includes assistance to help a business remain in operation or recover from

losses, and also to allow the Tribe to be able to determine what it means to be an

Indian-owned enterprise. One Tribal Comment also requests that grants for

establishing and assisting Indian-owned enterprises should be excluded from gross

income.

       The administrative general welfare exclusion generally does not apply to

payments made to businesses, including sole proprietors. Instead, the exclusion is
intended to address benefits that promote the general welfare of families and

individuals. See also Revenue Procedure 2014-35, which applies only to individuals

and not to businesses. Section 139E also applies only to individuals and not to

businesses. Thus, these proposed regulations do not address grants to Indian-owned

enterprises. However, these proposed regulations do not affect the validity of Revenue

Ruling 77-77, which provides a limited exception to the rule that the administrative

general welfare doctrine does not apply to businesses. Under that revenue ruling, a

grant made by an Indian Tribal government to a Tribal member to expand an Indian-

owned business on or near a reservation is excluded from the Tribal member’s gross

income under the administrative general welfare exclusion.

C. Trust arrangements and deferred benefits

       The TTAC Report states that an Indian Tribal government program may

distribute general welfare benefits from trust arrangements, including payments that are

set aside for the health, education, and welfare of trust beneficiaries under IGRA. The

TTAC Report recommends that the proposed regulations provide that the determination

of whether a payment is a general welfare benefit is made at the time the trust

distributes the payment to the beneficiary from the trust. Some Tribal Comments asked

that the proposed regulations expressly recognize that health, education, and welfare

payments under a minor’s trust can be structured in a way to qualify payments for

exclusion under section 139E.

       The TTAC Report requests that the proposed regulations provide that an Indian

Tribal government program may permit Tribal members and other recipients to defer

and accumulate benefits for future payment. The TTAC Report suggests that if the

amount is not lavish or extravagant at the time the beneficiary defers receipt of the

payment, then section 139E is satisfied at the time the Indian Tribal government

distributes the funds to the beneficiary. The TTAC Report also recommends that
section 139E not be limited by constructive receipt and economic benefit restrictions on

the deferral of taxable income or benefits. Many Tribal Comments support the TTAC

Report on the issue of deferred benefits, and request that the proposed regulations

provide examples of deferred benefits.

       Section 139E does not specifically address trust arrangements or deferred

benefits. Section 139E addresses whether a benefit that is generally includible in gross

income under section 61 may be excluded from gross income under section 139E. It

does not address the taxable year in which a benefit may be includible in gross income,

in particular if a benefit is put into a trust or its receipt is deferred through some other

arrangement. Most individuals use the cash receipts and disbursements method of

accounting, which incorporates numerous rules addressing when amounts must be

included in gross income. Those rules generally apply in determining when a benefit

must be included in the gross income and include the concepts of constructive receipt

and economic benefit. In addition, there is existing authority addressing trusts under

IGRA that is not affected by these proposed regulations. See Revenue Procedure

2011-56 (2011-49 I.R.B. 834), which provides a safe harbor under which the IRS treats

a Tribe as the grantor and owner of a trust for the receipt of Tribal gaming revenues

under IGRA for the benefit of minors and certain other individuals. However, as

described in the Comments and Public Hearing section of this preamble, the Treasury

Department and the IRS request comments on whether additional guidance is needed

under section 139E or other Code sections to address the tax treatment of deferred

benefits or benefits paid from trust arrangements and, if so, what specific fact patterns

should be addressed.

D. Advance rulings

       Some Tribal Comments propose that the Treasury Department and the IRS allow

Tribes to request advance rulings at the option of the Tribe to address the tax status of
general welfare programs. These comments request, however, that any procedure

involving advance rulings requests must be implemented with narrow parameters to

avoid becoming a de facto audit of Tribal programs. In addition, these Tribal Comments

suggest that these advance rulings be binding on states and other Federal agencies.

The Treasury Department and the IRS appreciate that Indian Tribal governments have

been awaiting guidance under section 139E and have concerns about how the IRS may

view existing general welfare programs. The IRS has a general process in place for

entities and individuals to request a letter ruling on the tax treatment of a particular

transaction or program, but that process generally does not apply if the request

presents an issue that cannot be readily resolved before a regulation or any other

published guidance is issued. See Revenue Procedure 2024-1 (2024-1 I.R.B. 1). If an

Indian Tribal government or a Tribal member receives a letter ruling from the IRS, the

ruling generally is binding on the IRS. However, a letter ruling would address only

Federal tax law and would not be binding in any way on any other Federal agency or

any state agency.

       As discussed in part VIII of this Explanation of Provisions, section 4(a) of the Act

requires the IRS to suspend all audits or examinations to the extent the audit or

examination relates to the exclusion from gross income of benefits under the general

welfare exclusion. After soliciting public comments and holding Tribal consultation on

these proposed regulations, the Treasury Department and the IRS intend to issue final

regulations that provide clear and helpful guidance on Tribal general welfare benefits.

Further, in accordance with section 3(b)(2) of the Act, the Secretary of the Treasury, in

consultation with the TTAC, will establish certain training and education, which

specifically includes the provision of training and technical assistance to Tribal financial

officers about implementation of section 139E. The Treasury Department and the IRS

will continue to work with the TTAC and Tribes throughout this rulemaking process to
ensure that the final rules are comprehensive and provide as much clarity and certainty

as possible within the parameters of the section 139E.

VI. Safe Harbors and Examples

       The Tribal Comments were not uniform on whether it would be helpful for the

proposed regulations to provide examples of benefits that qualify as Tribal general

welfare benefits. Some Tribal Comments recommend examples to help Indian Tribal

governments identify what types of benefits would be considered for promotion of

general welfare. In contrast, some Tribal Comments express concern that a list of

examples of permissible benefits would over time be viewed as an exhaustive list of

permissible benefits.

       The TTAC Report requests that Indian Tribal governments be given the ability to

rely on programs that meet the safe harbor requirements of Revenue Procedure 2014-

35. Some Tribal Comments argue that the safe harbors in Revenue Procedure 2014-35

were arbitrarily limiting and state that the proposed regulations should refrain from using

safe harbors to avoid establishing similar limitations under section 139E. However,

many other Tribal Comments recommend incorporating the safe harbors from Revenue

Procedure 2014-35 into the proposed regulations or expanding the safe harbors to

include payments from net gaming revenue, payments under section 139E(c)(5), and

programs developed pursuant to official determinations by Indian Tribal governments.

The Tribal Comments also request that the proposed regulations expressly state that a

safe harbor is not intended to limit the types of general welfare programs otherwise

permitted under section 139E.

       Revenue Procedure 2014-35 contains numerous safe harbors under which the

IRS will conclusively presume that the individual need requirement of the administrative

general welfare exclusion is met. As a revenue procedure, this guidance represents an

official statement of a procedure by the IRS that affects the rights or duties of taxpayers
under Federal tax law, rather than an official statement of IRS position on a substantive

tax issue like the administrative general welfare exclusion. See §601.601 of the

Statement of Procedural Rules (25 CFR part 601). Thus, the safe harbors in Revenue

Procedure 2014-35 do not represent examples of the application of the administrative

general welfare exclusion, but instead are fact patterns for which the IRS is required to

presume that the need requirement of the administrative general welfare exclusion is

met. Accordingly, taxpayers may rely upon the safe harbors in Revenue Procedure

2014-35, but the revenue procedure does not have the force and effect of Treasury

regulations.

          The enactment of section 139E provides authority for the Treasury Department

and the IRS to issue regulations to interpret section 139E. Regulations are the most

authoritative form of published guidance and generally include substantive rules

interpreting the statute. Treasury regulations often include examples in the regulatory

text to illustrate specific provisions of the regulation. These examples describe how the

regulatory rule applies to a set of facts, but examples cannot be the source of the rule

itself.

          The proposed regulations would provide examples of benefits that are for the

promotion of general welfare under section 139E(b)(2)(B). The Treasury Department

and the IRS agree that the examples in these proposed regulations are illustrations of

benefits that are for the promotion of general welfare and are not intended to represent

an exhaustive list of qualifying benefits. The examples in the proposed regulations also

would incorporate the safe harbors in Revenue Procedure 2014-35. Section 139E was

intended generally to codify Revenue Procedure 2014-35, and these proposed

regulations are intended to be no less favorable than Revenue Procedure 2014-35,

consistent with the intent of Congress reflected in the House Debate and Senate

Colloquy in enacting the Act. Therefore, the general welfare programs described as
safe harbors in Revenue Procedure 2014-35 would also be programs that satisfy the

promotion of general welfare requirement under section 139E(b)(2)(B). Thus, these

proposed regulations would include the list of programs described in section 5.02(2) of

Revenue Procedure 2014-35 as a non-exhaustive list of the types of programs that

would satisfy the general welfare requirement in section 139E and these proposed

regulations. As described in the Comments and Public Hearing section of this

preamble, the Treasury Department and the IRS request comments on whether

additional examples are necessary.

VII. Proposed Obsolescence of Revenue Procedure 2014-35

       Revenue Procedure 2014-35 generally provides principles for applying the

administrative general welfare exclusion and provides safe harbors under which the IRS

conclusively presumes that the individual need requirement of the administrative

general welfare exclusion is met for benefits provided under Indian Tribal government

programs that are described under section 5.02 or 5.03 of the revenue procedure. In

Notice 2015-34, the Treasury Department and the IRS announced that section 139E

codified (but does not supplant) the administrative general welfare exclusion for certain

benefits provided under Indian Tribal government programs, and that “Revenue

Procedure 2014-35 may be broader than section 139E in some instances.”

       Many Tribal Comments argue that the safe harbors in Revenue Procedure 2014-

35 were superseded by section 139E. Some Tribal Comments express the preference

that Revenue Procedure 2014-35 be expanded to explicitly incorporate the concept of

deference to the Tribe.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS are of the view that the proposed

regulations, if finalized, generally would provide rules that are at least as favorable as

the safe harbors provided under Revenue Procedure 2014-35 and therefore, that Indian

Tribal governments may have no further need to rely on Revenue Procedure 2014-35.
In addition, the Treasury Department and the IRS expect that Indian Tribal governments

would benefit by having a single set of rules that apply specifically to their general

welfare benefit programs, rather than having to analyze their programs under both

Revenue Procedure 2014-35 and the section 139E final regulations. Thus, the

Treasury Department and the IRS propose to obsolete and supersede Revenue

Procedure 2014-35 after the final regulations are applicable. As described in the

Comments and Public Hearing section of this preamble, the Treasury Department and

the IRS request comments on this issue.

VIII. Audit Suspension and IRS Training

       Section 4 of the Act directs the Secretary of the Treasury to suspend all audits

and examinations of Indian Tribal governments and members of Tribes (or any spouse

or dependent of such a member) to the extent such an audit or examination relates to

the exclusion of a payment or benefit from an Indian Tribal government under the

general welfare exclusion, until the education and training prescribed by section 3(b)(2)

of the Act is completed. Section 3(b)(2) of the Act directs the Secretary of the Treasury,

in consultation with the TTAC, to establish and require (A) training and education for

internal revenue field agents who administer and enforce internal revenue laws with

respect to Tribes on Federal Indian law and the Federal Government’s unique legal

treaty and trust relationship with Indian Tribal governments, and (B) training of such

internal revenue field agents, and provision of training and technical assistance to Tribal

financial officers, about implementation of the Act and the amendments made thereby.

       The TTAC Report requests that the proposed regulations refer to the audit

suspension provided in section 4 of the Act. Specifically, the TTAC Report requests

that the proposed regulations provide that all audits and examinations of Indian Tribal

governments, Tribal members, and qualified nonmembers (as defined in Revenue

Procedure 2014-35) to the extent that an audit or examination relates to the reporting or
exclusion of a Tribal general welfare benefit are suspended until a specified time related

to prospective enforcement of the final regulations. The TTAC Report further requests

that enforcement of the final regulations be delayed for one year after the training and

guidance required by section 3(b)(2) of the Act is completed (the compliance date), and

that when examinations commence, they relate only to the periods beginning on or after

the one-year period beginning on or after the compliance date. The TTAC Report further

states that guidance under section 139E must be applied prospectively and that Tribes

and Tribal citizens who have developed and administered programs in good faith will

not be audited retroactively once the audit suspension is lifted. Many Tribal Comments

agree with the TTAC Report.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS acknowledge that section 4 of the Act

provides a temporary suspension of audits and examinations of Indian Tribal

governments and Tribal members (or any spouse or dependent of such member) to the

extent that the audit or examination relates to the exclusion of a payment or benefit from

an Indian Tribal government under the general welfare exclusion. The Treasury

Department and the IRS expect that the audit suspension described in section 4 of the

Act will continue until all the requirements of section 3(b)(2) of the Act are satisfied. In

particular, the Treasury Department and the IRS contemplate that the education and

training described in section 3(b)(2) of the Act, which requires training to the Internal

revenue field agents and to Tribal financial officers about implementation of section

139E, cannot and will not take place until final regulations are issued under section

139E. Thus, once final regulations under section 139E are issued, the Treasury

Department and the IRS, in consultation with the TTAC, will conduct the required

education and training under section 3(b)(2) of the Act. Only after that education and

training is complete will the audit suspension be lifted. These proposed regulations do

not address the education and training that will be required to be complete before the
audit suspension is lifted, but the Treasury Department and the IRS will consult with the

TTAC on the requirements of section 3(b)(2) of the Act before the commencement of

the required education and training and will provide further guidance after that

consultation.

IX. Information Reporting

       If section 139E applies to exclude the value of a benefit from the Tribal program

participant’s gross income, then there is no requirement to file with the IRS or furnish to

the Tribal program participant an information return on Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous

Information, for that benefit. Indian Tribal governments should not include the amount

of any benefit that qualifies for exclusion under section 139E on a Form 1099-MISC that

is filed with the IRS and furnished to the Tribal program participant. Including such

amounts on a Form 1099-MISC when such amounts are not required to be reported on

the Tribal program participant’s individual tax return could result in IRS compliance

activity, such as inquiries from the IRS automated underreporting (AUR) program.

X. Tribal Consultation

       Some Tribal Comments request that the Treasury Department and the IRS

engage in consultation with Tribes throughout the development and implementation of

the regulations, and any additional guidance. In addition, several of these Tribal

Comments request additional consultation before the proposed regulations are

published in the Federal Register.

       The Treasury Department and the IRS agree with the Tribal Comments and

expect that consultation will continue throughout the rulemaking process that will

culminate with the publication of final regulations in the Federal Register. As noted in

the Background section of this preamble, the Treasury Department and the IRS held

consultation on the Act and the TTAC Report on December 14, 15, and 16, 2022, and

also received comments pursuant to that consultation. These proposed regulations
reflect the input from the TTAC Report and the comments received through

consultation. The Treasury Department and the IRS also plan to hold consultation after

these proposed regulations are issued and will consider comments from that

consultation when drafting final regulations. This consultation is in addition to the

standard notice and comment process for proposed regulations, which will include the

opportunity to participate in a public hearing and to provide comments through

https://www.regulations.gov. Comments received during these processes will be

considered and addressed in the final regulations. Finally, the Treasury Department

and the IRS expect to continue discussions with the GWE Subcommittee and the TTAC

on all aspects of section 139E.

Proposed Applicability Date

       These regulations are proposed to apply to taxable years of Tribal Program

Participants that begin on or after the date of publication of the final regulations in the

Federal Register.

Comments and Public Hearing

       Before these proposed amendments to the regulations are adopted as final

regulations, consideration will be given to any comments that are submitted timely to the

IRS as prescribed in the preamble under the ADDRESSES section. The Treasury

Department and the IRS request comments on all aspects of the proposed regulations.

In addition, the Treasury Department and the IRS request comments on the following

specific issues:

       (1) Should additional examples be included in the final regulations, and if so,

what specific fact patterns or rules should be addressed by the additional examples?

       (2) Should Revenue Procedure 2014-35 be obsoleted when the final regulations

become applicable? If not, why is there a continuing need for it after the publication of

final regulations?
       (3) Do Indian Tribal governments anticipate needing any transition relief to adjust

existing general welfare programs to satisfy these proposed regulations before they are

finalized? If yes, please explain the nature of the transition relief needed and provide

recommendations as to what relief would be helpful to Indian Tribal governments.

       (4) Is additional guidance needed under section 139E or other Code sections to

address the tax treatment of deferred benefits or benefits paid from trust arrangements,

and, if so, what specific fact patterns should be addressed?

       Any comments submitted will be made available at https://www.regulations.gov

or upon request. Once submitted to the Federal eRulemaking Portal, comments cannot

be edited or withdrawn.

       A public hearing will be held on January 13, 2025, beginning at 10 a.m. ET, in the

Auditorium at the Internal Revenue Building, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW.,

Washington, DC. Due to building security procedures, visitors must enter at the

Constitution Avenue entrance. In addition, all visitors must present photo identification

to enter the building. Because of access restrictions, visitors will not be admitted

beyond the immediate entrance area more than 30 minutes before the hearing starts.

Pursuant to Announcement 2023-16, 2023-20 I.R.B. 854 (May 15, 2023), the public

hearing is scheduled to be conducted in person, but the IRS will provide a telephonic

option for individuals who wish to attend or testify at the hearing by telephone.

       The rules of 26 CFR 601.601(a)(3) apply to the hearing. Persons who wish to

present oral comments at the hearing must submit an outline of the topics to be

discussed as well as the time to be devoted to each topic by [INSERT DATE 90 DAYS

AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER]. A period of ten

minutes will be allocated to each person for making comments. After the deadline for

receiving outlines has passed, the IRS will prepare an agenda containing the schedule

of speakers. Copies of the agenda will be made available free of charge at the hearing.
If no outlines of the topics to be discussed at the hearing are received by [INSERT

DATE 90 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER], the

public hearing will be cancelled. If the public hearing is cancelled, a notice of

cancellation of the public hearing will be published in the Federal Register.

       Individuals who want to testify in person at the public hearing must send an email

to publichearings@irs.gov to have your name added to the building access list. The

subject line of the email must contain the regulation number REG-106851-21 and the

language TESTIFY In Person. For example, the subject line may say: “Request to

TESTIFY In Person at Hearing for REG-106851-21.”

       Individuals who want to testify by telephone at the public hearing must send an

email to publichearings@irs.gov to receive the telephone number and access code for

the hearing. The subject line of the email must contain the regulation number REG-

106851-21 and the language TESTIFY Telephonically. For example, the subject line

may say: “Request to TESTIFY Telephonically at Hearing for REG-106851-21.”

       Individuals who want to attend the public hearing in person without testifying

must also send an email to publichearings@irs.gov to have your name added to the

building access list. The subject line of the email must contain the regulation number

(REG-106851-21) and the language ATTEND In Person. For example, the subject line

may say: “Request to ATTEND Hearing In Person for REG-106851-21.” Requests to

attend the public hearing must be received by 5 p.m. ET on January 9, 2025.

       Individuals who want to attend the public hearing telephonically without testifying

must send an email to publichearings@irs.gov to receive the telephone number and

access code for the hearing. The subject line of the email must contain the regulation

number (REG-106851-21) and the language ATTEND Hearing Telephonically. For

example, the subject line may say: “Request to ATTEND Hearing Telephonically for

REG-106851-21.” Requests to attend the public hearing must be received by 5 p.m. ET
on January 9, 2025.

       The hearing will be made accessible to people with disabilities. To request

special assistance during the hearing, contact the Publications and Regulations Branch

of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel (Procedure and Administration) by sending an

Special Analyses

I. Executive Order 13175: Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal

Governments

       Executive Order 13175 (Consultation and Coordination With Indian Tribal

Governments) prohibits an agency from publishing any rule that has Tribal implications

if the rule either imposes substantial, direct compliance costs on Indian Tribal

governments and is not required by statute, or preempts Tribal law, unless the agency

meets the consultation and funding requirements of section 5 of the Executive order.

These proposed regulations have a substantial direct effect on one or more Federally-

recognized Indian Tribes and do impose substantial direct compliance costs on Indian

Tribal governments within the meaning of the Executive order. As a result, the Treasury

Department intends to comply with section 5(b)(2)(A)-(B) of Executive Order 13175. In

compliance with section 5(b)(2)(A) of Executive Order 13175 and in response to Tribal

leader requests for proposed regulations, the Treasury Department and the IRS held

consultations with Tribal leaders on December 14, 15, and 16, 2022, requesting

assistance in addressing questions related to the Act and the TTAC Report, which

informed the development of these proposed regulations. The Treasury Department

and the IRS also intend to conduct Tribal consultation on these proposed regulations.

II. Regulatory Planning and Review

       Pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreement, Review of Treasury Regulations
under Executive Order 12866 (June 9, 2023), tax regulatory actions issued by the IRS

are not subject to the requirements of section 6(b) of Executive Order 12866, as

amended. Therefore, a regulatory impact assessment is not required.

III. Paperwork Reduction Act

      The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501–3520) generally requires

that a Federal agency obtain the approval of the Office of Management and Budget

(OMB) before collecting information from the public, whether such collection of

information is mandatory, voluntary, or required to obtain or retain a benefit. An agency

may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of

information unless the collection of information displays a valid control number.

      These proposed regulations would include third-party disclosures and

recordkeeping requirements that are required to substantiate that the value of a Tribal

General Welfare Benefit is excluded from a recipient’s gross income. These collections

of information would generally be used by the IRS for tax compliance purposes and by

taxpayers to facilitate proper substantiation of the gross income exclusion. The likely

respondents to these collections are Indian Tribal governments and individuals.

      The recordkeeping requirements in proposed §1.139E-1(c)(3) would provide that

Indian Tribal government programs must be administered under specified guidelines

and would provide general requirements on the content of those guidelines. Under

proposed §1.139E-1(c)(3), the specified guidelines would need to, at a minimum,

describe the program, the benefits provided, the eligibility requirements of the program,

and the process for receiving benefits. Written specified guidelines would not be

required. However, Indian Tribal governments may keep records of affidavits or

declarations of how the program operates. These proposed regulations would not

prescribe the specific method of keeping these records. Indian Tribal governments

should keep these records in the manner they deem appropriate in order to substantiate
that the program qualifies as an Indian Tribal government program under section 139E

and these proposed regulations, and to assist Tribal program participants with

determining that a Tribal general welfare benefit may be excluded from gross income

under section 139E and these proposed regulations. Additionally, Indian Tribal

governments should keep records they deem appropriate to substantiate that the Tribal

general welfare benefits are distributed without discriminating in favor of the governing

body of the Tribe, as described in proposed §1.139E-1(c)(4), are not lavish or

extravagant, as described in proposed §1.139E-1(d)(4), and are not compensation for

services, as described in proposed §1.139E-1(d)(5). This information will generally be

used by the IRS for tax compliance purposes to ensure that Indian Tribal governments

are distributing Tribal general welfare benefits in accordance with proposed §1.139E-1.

       The recordkeeping requirements in proposed §1.139E-1(d)(4) would provide that

whether a benefit is lavish or extravagant is based on the facts and circumstances at

the time the benefit is provided. Proposed §1.139E-1(d)(4) would provide that a benefit

will be presumed not to be lavish or extravagant if the Indian Tribal government

establishes the program in writing and provides the benefit in accordance with the

program’s written specified guidelines. This presumption in proposed §1.139E-1(d)(4)

for a benefit provided in accordance with the program’s written specified guidelines

would be an optional rule and an Indian Tribal government may choose not to apply

such rule. This information will generally be used by the IRS for tax compliance

purposes to ensure that Indian Tribal governments are distributing Tribal general

welfare benefits in accordance with proposed §1.139E-1(d)(4).

       The third-party disclosure requirement may apply to Indian Tribal governments

that choose to provide notification to Tribal program participants that an Indian Tribal

government program exists for which Tribal program participants may apply for benefits.

These proposed regulations would not prescribe a specific method that Indian Tribal
governments must use to announce the existence of a program. An Indian Tribal

government may announce Indian Tribal government programs in any manner it deems

appropriate.

       These proposed regulations would not impose any additional recordkeeping

requirements on Tribal program participants. However, Tribal program participants are

required to maintain records under section 6001 sufficient to show that the value of a

Tribal general welfare benefit received from an Indian Tribal government program is

excludible from gross income. These records are required for the IRS to validate that

taxpayers have met the regulatory requirements for a Tribal general welfare benefit, and

that taxpayers are entitled to exclude the value of the benefit from gross income. The

burden associated with maintaining tax records is already approved under OMB number

1545-0074 that is used for Form 1040, Individual Tax Return. These proposed

regulations would not create or change the general recordkeeping requirement under

section 6001.

       There is limited data to calculate the burden estimates for these proposed

regulations. The Treasury Department and the IRS estimate the burden based on the

list of 574 Federally-recognized Tribes published by the Department of Interior, and

estimate an upper bound of 2,296 Indian Tribal governments, including their agencies or

instrumentalities. The estimate is based on an upper bound assumption that Indian

Tribal government programs are set up by each Indian Tribal government of a

Federally-recognized Tribe and by 3 separate agencies or instrumentalities of each

such Indian Tribal government. A summary of the Paperwork Reduction Act burden

estimates for the collections are as follows:

       Indian Tribal governments (third-party disclosure and recordkeeping burden for

Tribal entities):

                Estimated Number of Respondents: 2,296
              Estimated Time per Response: 2 hours

              Estimated Frequency of Response: Once or on occasion

              Estimated Total Burden Hours: 4,592 hours

       The collections of information contained in this notice of proposed rulemaking

has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review in accordance

with the Paperwork Reduction Act. Commenters are strongly encouraged to submit

public comments electronically. Written comments and recommendations for the

proposed information collection should be sent to www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAMain,

with copies to the Internal Revenue Service. Find this particular information collection

by selecting "Currently under Review - Open for Public Comments" then by using the

search function. Submit electronic submissions for the proposed information collection

to the IRS via email at pra.comments@irs.gov (indicate REG-106851-21 on the subject

line). Comments on the collection of information should be received by [INSERT DATE

90 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].

Comments are specifically requested concerning: Whether the proposed collection of

information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the IRS,

including whether the information will have practical utility; the accuracy of the estimated

burden associated with the proposed collection of information; how the quality, utility,

and clarity of the information to be collected may be enhanced; how the burden of

complying with the proposed collection of information may be minimized, including

through the application of automated collection techniques or other forms of information

technology; and estimates of capital or start-up costs and costs of operation,

maintenance, and purchase of services to provide information. The Paperwork

Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520) (PRA) generally requires that a Federal

agency obtain the approval of OMB before collecting information from the public,

whether such collection of information is mandatory, voluntary, or required to obtain or
retain a benefit. An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to

respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of information displays a

valid control number.

IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act

       The Secretary of the Treasury hereby certifies that the proposed regulations

would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities

pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6). These proposed

regulations would affect Indian Tribal governments that establish and administer Tribal

general welfare programs and that distribute Tribal general welfare benefits to certain

individuals. The Treasury Department and the IRS have no reliable data to determine

whether Tribal general welfare programs may be established and administered through

small entities, such as not-for-profit entities. Although data is not readily available about

the number of small entities that would potentially be affected by these proposed

regulations, it is possible that a substantial number of small entities may be affected.

However, any impact on those entities would not be economically significant and

therefore a regulatory flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not

required.

       The impact of these proposed regulations can be described in the following

categories. First, proposed § 1.139E-1(c) would provide guidance on what criteria a

program must meet in order to be an “Indian Tribal Government Program.” Specifically,

proposed §1.139E-1(c) would provide that the program must be established by the

Indian Tribal government; administered under specified guidelines; and not discriminate

in favor of members of the governing body of the Tribe. Even assuming that these

provisions would affect a substantial number of small entities, they would not have a

significant economic impact. Section 139E(b) imposes the burden of what is needed to

create an Indian Tribal government program. These proposed regulations would
provide deference to Indian Tribal governments on the types of general welfare

programs established, and generally defer to Indian Tribal governments on the form of

the program’s specified guidelines and the specific records they should maintain. As

such, it is expected that the proposed regulations would have a minimal economic

impact on Indian Tribal governments.

       Second, proposed §1.139E-1(d) would provide guidance on whether a benefit is

a “Tribal General Welfare Benefit” that is excluded from an individual’s gross income.

Specifically, proposed §1.139E-1(d) would require that the benefit be provided pursuant

to an Indian Tribal government program; be for the promotion of general welfare; be

available to any eligible Tribal program participant; not be lavish or extravagant; and,

except as provided in section 139E(c)(5), not be for compensation for services.

Proposed §1.139E-1(d) would provide deference to Indian Tribal governments on the

types of benefits that promote the general welfare, the individuals who are eligible for

benefits, and whether benefits are provided in exchange for participation in certain

cultural or ceremonial activities under section 139E(c)(5) and these proposed

regulations. It would also provide that a benefit is presumed to not be lavish or

extravagant if it is described in, and provided in accordance with, the written specified

guidelines of an Indian Tribal government program. As such, it is expected that the

proposed regulations would have a minimal economic impact on Indian Tribal

governments.

       Third, proposed § 1.139E-1(e) would permit an Indian Tribal government program

to provide to Tribal program participant benefits that are items of cultural significance,

reimbursement of costs, or cash honoraria for their participation in certain cultural or

ceremonial activities. Indian Tribal governments have broad discretion to determine

whether or not these benefits are provided. Even assuming that this provision affects a

substantial number of small entities, it would not have a significant economic impact
because benefits that are items of cultural significance, reimbursement of costs, and

cash honoraria are only a few types of the benefits that are permitted to be provided

under section 139E and proposed §1.139E-1. An Indian Tribal government is not

required to provide these types of benefits.

       For the reasons stated, a regulatory flexibility analysis under the Regulatory

Flexibility Act is not required. The Treasury Department and the IRS invite comments

on the impact of the proposed regulations on small entities.

       Pursuant to section 7805(f), this notice of proposed rulemaking has been

submitted to the Chief Counsel for the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business

Administration for comment on its impact on small business.

V. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act

       Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) requires that

agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits and take certain other actions before

issuing a final rule that includes any Federal mandate that may result in expenditures in

any one year by a State, local, or Indian Tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the

private sector, of $100 million (updated annually for inflation). These proposed

regulations do not include any Federal mandate that may result in expenditures by

State, local, or Indian Tribal governments, or by the private sector in excess of that

threshold.

VI. Executive Order 13132: Federalism

       Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) prohibits an agency from publishing any rule

that has federalism implications if the rule either imposes substantial, direct compliance

costs on State and local governments, and is not required by statute, or preempts State

law, unless the agency meets the consultation and funding requirements of section 6 of

the Executive Order. These proposed regulations do not have federalism implications

and do not impose substantial direct compliance costs on State and local governments
or preempt State law within the meaning of the Executive order.

§1.139E-2 [Reserved]

§1.139E-1 Tribal general welfare benefits.

      (a) Overview. Under section 139E of the Code and this section, the gross

income of a Tribal Program Participant for the taxable year does not include the value of

any Tribal General Welfare Benefit provided by an Indian Tribal Government Program
during the year to or on behalf of the Tribal Program Participant. Paragraph (b) of this

section provides definitions that apply for purposes of this section. Paragraph (c) of this

section provides the requirements that any program must satisfy to qualify as an Indian

Tribal Government Program for purposes of this section. Paragraph (d) of this section

provides the requirements that any benefit provided to or on behalf of a Tribal Program

Participant must satisfy to qualify as a Tribal General Welfare Benefit for purposes of

this section. Paragraph (e) of this section provides special rules related to cultural or

ceremonial activities solely for purposes of this section. Paragraph (f) of this section

describes the audit suspension provisions in section 4(a) of the Act. Paragraph (g) of

this section provides the date of applicability of this section.

       (b) Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of this section—

       (1) Act. The term Act means the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014,

Public Law 113–168, 128 Stat. 1883 (2014).

       (2) Benefit. The term benefit means any money, property, services, or other item

of value provided to or on behalf of an individual.

       (3) Code. The term Code means the Internal Revenue Code.

       (4) Indian Tribal Government. The term Indian Tribal Government means an

Indian Tribal Government as defined by section 7701(a)(40) of the Code and includes

any agencies or instrumentalities of such an Indian Tribal Government.

       (5) Indian Tribal Government Program. The term Indian Tribal Government

Program means a program that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c) of this

section.

       (6) Tribal General Welfare Benefit. The term Tribal General Welfare Benefit

means any benefit provided to or on behalf of a Tribal Program Participant that satisfies

the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section for exclusion from gross income as an

“Indian general welfare benefit” under section 139E of the Code.
       (7) Tribe. The term Tribe means any Indian Tribe, band, nation, pueblo, or other

organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village as defined in 43

U.S.C. 1602(c), that is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services

provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.

       (8) Tribal Program Participant--(i) In general. The term Tribal Program

Participant means a Tribal Member, spouse of a Tribal Member within the meaning of

§301.7701-18 of this chapter, spouse of a Tribal Member under applicable Tribal law,

dependent of a Tribal Member, or other individual who has been determined by the

Indian Tribal Government to be eligible for a Tribal General Welfare Benefit because

such individual is, with respect to a Tribal Member, an ancestor, descendant, former

spouse, widow or widower, or legally recognized domestic partner or former domestic

partner.

       (ii) Special rule for ceremonial or cultural activities. Solely for purposes of

paragraph (e) of this section, the term Tribal Program Participant may include a member

or citizen of a Tribe that is different from the Tribe that establishes or maintains the

Indian Tribal Government Program that provides the Tribal General Welfare Benefit.

       (9) Tribal Member. The term Tribal Member means an individual who is a

member or citizen of the Tribe that establishes or maintains the Indian Tribal

Government Program because the individual meets the requirements established by

applicable Tribal law for enrollment in the Tribe, and:

       (i) Is listed on the Tribal rolls of the Tribe if such rolls are kept;

       (ii) Is recognized as a member by the Tribe if Tribal rolls are not kept; or

       (iii) Is an Indian child as defined in 25 U.S.C. 1903.

       (10) Dependent. The term dependent means an individual who—

       (i) Is a qualifying child, as defined in section 152 of the Code, of a Tribal Member

for the taxable year;
       (ii) Is a qualifying relative, as defined in section 152, of a Tribal Member for the

taxable year;

       (iii) Is a qualifying child or qualifying relative of a Tribal Member described in

paragraph (b)(10)(i) or (ii) of this section for the taxable year of the Tribal Member

beginning in a calendar year without regard to whether the Tribal Member was a

qualifying child or qualifying relative, each as defined in section 152, of another taxpayer

for a taxable year of the other taxpayer beginning in that calendar year;

       (iv) Is a qualifying child or qualifying relative of a Tribal Member described in

paragraph (b)(10)(i) or (ii) of this section for the taxable year of the Tribal Member

beginning in a calendar year without regard to whether the individual filed a joint return

with the individual’s spouse (as defined in section 6013 of the Code) for the taxable year

beginning in that calendar year; or

       (v) Is a qualifying relative of a Tribal Member described in paragraph (b)(10)(ii) of

this section for the taxable year of the Tribal Member beginning in a calendar year

without regard to the individual’s gross income for the calendar year in which the

individual’s taxable year begins.

       (c) Indian Tribal Government Program--(1) In general. A program is an Indian

Tribal Government Program only if the program:

       (i) Is established by the Indian Tribal Government, as described in paragraph

(c)(2) of this section;

       (ii) Is administered under specified guidelines, as described in paragraph (c)(3) of

this section; and

       (iii) Does not discriminate in favor of members of the governing body of the Tribe,

as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

       (2) Program must be established--(i) In general. A program must be established

by an Indian Tribal Government. A program established by Tribal custom or
government practice, or by formal action of the Indian Tribal Government, is a program

established by the Indian Tribal Government. Formal action means authorization of the

program pursuant to applicable Tribal law. The formal action must be in writing to the

extent such writing is required under applicable Tribal law. For example, written

documentation that evidences the formal action of the Indian Tribal Government to

establish the program is required if such written documentation is required under

applicable Tribal law. Similarly, no written documentation of the formal action of the

Indian Tribal Government to establish the program is required if, under applicable Tribal

law, no written documentation of such action is required. As an additional example, a

program may be established by a voice vote if such voice vote would otherwise

constitute formal action of the Indian Tribal Government under applicable Tribal law. To

the extent permitted under applicable Tribal law, an Indian Tribal Government may

delegate the authority for establishing a program to a designated individual or entity of

the Indian Tribal Government.

       (ii) Examples. The requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section are illustrated

by the following examples:

       (A) Example 1. A, a Tribe, operates under the direction of its Indian Tribal
Government (the Council). According to the laws of A, all expenditures of A must be
approved by a majority of the Council at the Council’s annual meeting or by written
unanimous consent if the action is taken without a meeting. During the annual meeting
of A’s Council, a majority of the Council vote to approve establishing a program. A’s
Council has established the program under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.

       (B) Example 2. Same facts as in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (Example
1), except that, based on a recommendation from the Tribal Education office, A’s
Council determines to provide funding for a scholarship program to pay 100% of
education related expenses for any Tribal Member who graduates from high school or
receives a GED during the calendar year. Because the next Council meeting is
scheduled in December 2024, and to avoid potential impact on eligible students, in
February 2024, Council adopts by unanimous written consent the following education
program:

       (1) Approving $X of funding for the 2024 year for the scholarship program; and

       (2) Authorizing the director of the Tribal Education office to use the approved
funds for the scholarship program. A’s Council has established the education program
under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.

      (C) Example 3. Same facts as in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section (Example
2) except that A’s Council approves $X of annual funding to be provided for the
education program, and delegates to the Tribal Education office authority to establish a
scholarship program. A’s Council has established the education program under
paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.

       (3) Program must be administered under specified guidelines. A program must

be administered under specified guidelines. The specified guidelines must include, at a

minimum, a description of the program to provide Tribal General Welfare Benefits, the

benefits provided by the program (including how benefits are determined), the eligibility

requirements for the program, and the process for receiving benefits under the program.

A program is administered under specified guidelines if the program is operated in

accordance with such guidelines. Indian Tribal Governments may choose to, but are

not required to, set forth the specified guidelines of the program in writing.

       (4) Program cannot discriminate in favor of members of the governing body of

the Tribe--(i) In general. Except in the case of a program described in paragraph

(c)(4)(ii) of this section, a program cannot discriminate in favor of members of the

governing body of the Tribe. For the purposes of this paragraph (c)(4), a governing

body means the legislative body of the Tribe, such as the Tribal Council, or the

representative equivalent of the legislative body of the Tribe.

       (ii) General council Tribes. A program is treated as being in compliance with this

paragraph (c)(4) if the governing body of a Tribe consists of the entire adult membership

of the Tribe.

       (iii) Facts and circumstances test. Except in the case of a program described in

paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, a program fails to satisfy the requirements of this

paragraph (c)(4) if based on all the facts and circumstances the program either by its

terms or in its administration discriminates in favor of members of the governing body of

the Tribe. Accordingly, a program discriminates in favor of the members of the
governing body of the Tribe if the program by its terms is available only to members of

the governing body. Additionally, the administration of a program discriminates in favor

of members of the governing body of the Tribe if, based on the facts and circumstances,

the benefits provided during the year disproportionately favor members of the governing

body. Thus, for example, a program established to provide benefits solely to the

children of members of the governing body of the Tribe (unless the Tribe is a general

council Tribe) and thus defrays costs otherwise borne by members of the governing

body fails to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph (c)(4).

       (5) No limitation on source of funds—(i) In general. Benefits under the Indian

Tribal Government Program may be funded by any source of revenue or funds. For

example, an Indian Tribal Government may use funds derived from levies, taxes, and

service fees; settlements; revenues from tribally-owned businesses, including casino

revenues; funds from Federal, State, or local governments; and funds from other

sources, including grants and loans, to provide benefits under an Indian Tribal

Government Program.

       (ii) Benefits funded by net gaming revenues. Benefits under the Indian Tribal

Government Program may be funded by net gaming revenues as permitted under the

Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. 2701-2721 (IGRA). However, per capita

payments, as defined under IGRA, are subject to Federal taxation under IGRA and are

not excludable from gross income under section 139E or this section. For purposes of

section 139E and this section, a payment is a per capita payment if it is identified by the

Indian Tribal Government as a per capita payment in a Revenue Allocation Plan that is

approved by the Department of the Interior. See 25 U.S.C. 2710(b)(3) and 25 CFR

290.11.

       (d) Tribal General Welfare Benefits--(1) In general. A benefit does not qualify as

a Tribal General Welfare Benefit unless the benefit is:
       (i) Provided pursuant to an Indian Tribal Government Program, as described in

paragraph (c) of this section;

       (ii) Provided for the promotion of general welfare, as described in paragraph

(d)(2) of this section;

       (iii) Available to any eligible Tribal Program Participant, as described in

paragraph (d)(3) of this section;

       (iv) Not lavish or extravagant, as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section;

and

       (v) Not compensation for services, as described in paragraph (d)(5) of this

section.

       (2) Benefits must be for the promotion of general welfare--(i) In general. Tribal

General Welfare Benefits must be for the promotion of general welfare. For purposes of

section 139E and this paragraph (d)(2), the Indian Tribal Government determines that a

benefit is for the promotion of general welfare at the time it establishes the Tribal

General Welfare Program meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. An

Indian Tribal Government has sole discretion to determine whether a benefit is for the

promotion of general welfare and the Internal Revenue Service will defer to the Indian

Tribal Government’s determination that a benefit is for the promotion of general welfare.

Benefits may be provided without regard to the financial or other need of Tribal Program

Participants and may be provided on a uniform or pro-rata basis to Tribal Program

Participants. Thus, for example, an Indian Tribal Government determines whether

benefits are for the promotion of general welfare under programs such as cultural

programs, housing assistance programs, programs to provide education benefits,

programs for training or retraining to acquire new skills or to obtain better employment

opportunities, programs to provide assistance for disasters or emergency situations,

funeral or burial assistance programs, legal aid programs, wellness and health-related
programs, or any programs that provide benefits to specific categories of individuals,

such as elderly individuals or minors.

       (ii) Examples. The requirements of paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section are

illustrated by the following examples. For the examples in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii),

assume the Indian Tribal Government has determined that the benefits provided are for

the promotion of general welfare.

       (A) Example 1: Housing programs. Indian Tribal Government A administers a
program, B, pursuant to which the following benefits are provided in connection with A’s
Tribal Members’ principal residences and ancillary structures which are not used in any
trade or business: payments for Tribal Members to use to make mortgage payments,
down payments, and rent payments (including but not limited to security deposits);
payments for Tribal Members to enhance habitability of housing, such as by remedying
water, sewage, sanitation service, safety (including but not limited to mold remediation),
and heating or cooling issues; payments for Tribal Members to provide for basic
housing repairs or rehabilitation (including but not limited to roof repair and
replacement); and payments to Tribal Members to pay utility bills and charges (including
but not limited to water, electricity, gas, and basic communications services such as
phone, internet, and cable). The payments made by A under B are for the promotion of
general welfare as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.

        (B) Example 2: Educational programs. Indian Tribal Government C administers a
program, D, pursuant to which the following benefits are provided: provision to students
(including but not limited to post-secondary students) of transportation to and from
school, tutors, and supplies (including but not limited to clothing, backpacks, laptop
computers, musical instruments, and sports equipment) for use in school activities and
extracurricular activities; tuition payments for students (including but not limited to
allowances for room and board on or off campus for the student, spouse, domestic
partner, and dependents) to attend preschool, school, college or university, online
school, educational seminars, vocational education, technical education, adult
education, continuing education, or alternative education; provision of care of children
away from their homes to help their parents or other relatives responsible for their care
to be gainfully employed or to pursue education; and provision of job counseling and
programs for which the primary objective is job placement or training, including but not
limited to allowances for expenses for interviewing or training away from home
(including but not limited to travel, auto expenses, lodging, and food), tutoring, and
appropriate clothing for a job interview or training (including but not limited to an
interview suite or a uniform required during a period of training). The payments made
by C under D are for the promotion of general welfare as described in paragraph
(d)(2)(i) of this section.

        (C) Example 3: Elder and disabled programs. Indian Tribal Government E
administers a program, F, pursuant to which the following benefits are provided to Tribal
Members who have attained age 55 or are mentally or physically disabled (as defined
under applicable law, including but not limited to an Indian Tribal Government’s
disability laws): meals through home-delivered meals programs or at a community
center or similar facility; home care such as assistance with preparing meals or doing
chores, or day care outside the home; local transportation assistance; and
improvements to adapt housing to special needs (including but not limited to grab bars
and ramps). The payments made by E under F are for the promotion of general welfare
as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.

       (D) Example 4: Transportation programs. Indian Tribal Government G
administers a program, H, pursuant to which the following benefits are provided:
payment of transportation costs such as rental cars, substantiated mileage, and fares
for bus, taxi, and public transportation between an Indian reservation (as defined in
section 168(j)), service area (as defined in 25 CFR 20.100), or service unit area
(meaning an area designated for purposes of administration of Indian Health Service
programs under 42 CFR 136.21(1)) and facilities that provide essential services to the
public (such as medical facilities and grocery stores). The payments made by G under
H are for the promotion of general welfare as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this
section.

       (E) Example 5: Medical programs. Indian Tribal Government J administers a
program, K, pursuant to which the following benefits are provided: payments for the cost
of transportation, temporary meals, and lodging of a Tribal Program Participant while
the individual is receiving medical care away from home, or to pay the cost of
nonprescription drugs (including but not limited to traditional Tribal medicines). The
payments made by J under K are for the promotion of general welfare as described in
paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.

        (F) Example 6: Emergency programs. Indian Tribal Government L administers a
program, M, pursuant to which the following benefits are provided: assistance to
individuals in exigent circumstances (including but not limited to victims of abuse),
including but not limited to the costs of food, clothing, shelter, transportation, auto repair
bills, and similar expenses; payment of costs for temporary relocation and shelter for
individuals involuntarily displaced from their homes (including but not limited to
situations in which a home is destroyed by a fire or natural disaster); and assistance for
transportation emergencies (for example, when stranded away from home) in the form
of transportation costs, a hotel room, and meals. The payments made by L under M are
for the promotion of general welfare as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.

        (G) Example 7: Cultural and religious programs. Indian Tribal Government N
administers a program, P, pursuant to which the following benefits are provided:
payment of expenses (including but not limited to admission fees, transportation, food,
and lodging) to attend or participate in a Tribe’s cultural, social, religious, or community
activities, such as powwows, ceremonies, and traditional dances; payment of expenses
(including but not limited to admission fees, transportation, food, and lodging) to visit
sites that are culturally or historically significant for the Tribe, including but not limited to
other Indian reservations (as defined in section 168(j)); payment of the costs of
receiving instruction about a Tribe’s culture, history, and traditions (including but not
limited to traditional language, music, and dances); payment of funeral and burial
expenses and expenses of hosting or attending wakes, funerals, burials, other
bereavement events, and subsequent honoring events; and payment of transportation
costs and admission fees to attend educational, social, or cultural programs offered or
supported by the Tribe or another Tribe. The payments made by N under P are for the
promotion of general welfare as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.

       (3) Benefits must be available. The benefits provided under an Indian Tribal
Government Program must be available to any Tribal Program Participant who meets

the specified guidelines of the program required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section,

subject to budgetary constraints. However, the Indian Tribal Government has discretion

to determine the category of individuals who are Tribal Program Participants under the

Indian Tribal Government Program, provided that such determination is consistent with

the specified guidelines described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and subject to the

prohibition on discrimination under paragraph (c)(4) of this section. Thus, for example,

an Indian Tribal Government is permitted to limit eligibility for an Indian Tribal

Government Program to dependents of Tribal Members who have attained a specified

age, or, as another example, to a Tribal Member’s household.

       (4) Benefits cannot be lavish or extravagant. The benefit provided by an Indian

Tribal Government Program cannot be lavish or extravagant. Whether a benefit is

lavish or extravagant for purposes of this section is based on the facts and

circumstances at the time the benefit is provided. Relevant facts and circumstances

include a Tribe’s culture and cultural practices, history, geographic area, traditions,

resources, and economic conditions or factors. A benefit will be presumed to not be

lavish or extravagant if it is described in, and provided in accordance with, the written

specified guidelines of an Indian Tribal Government Program.

       (5) Benefits cannot be compensation for services. Except as provided in

paragraph (e) of this section, a Tribal General Welfare Benefit does not include benefits

that are provided as compensation for services to any person. Under section 61(a) of

the Code, compensation for services includes fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and

similar items, whether paid in money or property.

       (e) Cultural or ceremonial activities--(1) In general. For purposes of section 139E

and paragraph (d)(5) of this section, a benefit is not compensation for services if:

       (i) The benefit is provided to a Tribal Program Participant for their participation in
cultural or ceremonial activities for the transmission of Tribal culture as determined by

the Indian Tribal Government (including, but not limited to, powwows, rite of passage

ceremonies, funerals, wakes, burials, other bereavement events, and honoring events);

and

       (ii) The benefit consists of an item of cultural significance as determined by the

Indian Tribal Government, the reimbursement of costs, or a cash honorarium.

       (2) Application. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(2), an Indian

Tribal Government has sole discretion to determine whether an item is an item of

cultural significance and whether an activity is a cultural or ceremonial activity, and the

Internal Revenue Service will defer to these determinations by the Indian Tribal

Government. However, cash, gift cards, or vehicles are generally not items of cultural

significance.

       (3) Examples. The application of this paragraph (e) is illustrated by the following

examples:

       (i) Example 1: Benefits for cultural or ceremonial activities not compensation for
services. Tribe B regularly holds a gathering during the fall season to celebrate its
cultural traditions. During the gathering, Tribal Members of B, as well as Tribal
members of other Tribes from around the region, are invited to participate. The Indian
Tribal Government of B (ITG-B) allocates funds for the gathering, some of which are
used for the following payments:

       (A) Tribal Member of B. Individual 1, a Tribal Member of B, provides traditional
blessings on the first and final days of the gathering. ITG-B gives Individual 1 a cash
honorarium in recognition of providing the blessings. The cash honorarium that
Individual 1 receives from ITG-B is not compensation for services under this paragraph
(e).

        (B) Tribal Member of different Tribe. Individual 2, a Tribal Member of Tribe C,
participates as a drummer for a ceremonial dance on the second day of the gathering.
ITG-B gives Individual 2 a piece of culturally significant jewelry. Under paragraph
(a)(7)(ii) of this section, Individual 2 is a Tribal Program Participant solely for purposes
of this paragraph (e). The jewelry that Individual 2 receives from ITG-B is not
compensation for services under this paragraph (e).

       (ii) Example 2: Benefits for cultural or ceremonial activities not compensation for
services. Tribe C operates a language preservation center in which Individual 3, a
Tribal Member of C, who speaks the traditional language that is common to C and other
regional Tribes, volunteers to come in every Saturday to discuss and teach the
traditional language of C to other Tribal Members of C. The Indian Tribal Government
of C (ITG-C), reimburses Individual 3 for travel expenses and teaching supplies used in
Individual 3’s language lessons. The reimbursement of costs that Individual 3 receives
from ITG-C is not compensation for services under this paragraph (e).

       (f) Audit suspension. After [date of publication of the final regulations in the

Federal Register], the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service

(IRS) will, in consultation with the Treasury Tribal Advisory Committee, establish and
