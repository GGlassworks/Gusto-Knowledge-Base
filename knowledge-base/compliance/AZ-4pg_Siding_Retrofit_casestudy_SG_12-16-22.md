Siding & Window Retrofit Case Study

Block Walls

                                             Rigid foam exterior insulation and solar screens were among the energy-saving retrofits
                                             to this 1950s concrete block home in Phoenix.


Builder Profile                           Concrete block homes were built across the southwest and in Florida, especially from

Phoenix, AZ                               are concrete block homes, known locally as “slump block” homes. Some home owners
Jonathan Waterworth                       have upgraded their homes by adding framing plus drywall inside and siding, usually

                                          The U.S. Department of Energy’s Building Technologies Office is working in partnership with national laboratories,
                                          the building industry, and other stakeholders to develop cost-effective energy-saving technologies and strategies
                                          to reduce building energy consumption. In support of this effort, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, in
                                          partnership with Building Science Corporation and Earth Advantage, conducted a series of techno-economic
                                          studies to evaluate the home performance contractor business case for including window and wall insulation
                                          upgrades as part of conventional home siding replacement projects. Five existing homes were selected for study
                                          that were already scheduled for siding replacement. These homes represented a variety of U.S. climate zones
                                          and existing wall assemblies. DOE management oversight was provided by Marc LaFrance, Manager for DOE’s
                                          Residential Buildings Integration Market Transformation Program.

     The original home had no insulation,
     no exterior siding, no interior framed
     wall, and no drywall. The entire wall
     assembly consisted of uninsulated
     concrete block that was painted on the
     interior and exterior. In this retrofit, 2
     inches of foil-faced polyisocyanurate
     rigid foam was added to the exterior
     of the home then covered with metal
     lath and two-part stucco. The added
     insulation greatly improved the comfort
     of the home, especially on the east side
     of the home where a driveway reflected
     heat into the home.



  Wall-Window Retrofit Decision Tree                A primary concern of the homeowner was the east-facing side of the house, where
