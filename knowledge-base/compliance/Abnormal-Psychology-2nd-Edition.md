Alexis and I want to offer a special thank you to Ms. Celeste Ernst, undergraduate within the
online Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology program, for her edits of the 1st edition during
the spring 2020. Her changes, and our own, are integrated into the 2nd edition of the book and are
a dramatic improvement over the 1st edition. Thank you, Celeste.



We would also like to extend a special thank you to Madeleine Stewart and Matt Meier, PsyD.,
of the Department of Psychology at Arizona State University for the development of the lecture
slides for this book. They did this work unsolicited and produced top quality presentations which
we will include in a password protected page, along with additional ancillaries such as an
Instructor’s Manual and test banks, in the very near future (i.e. hopefully by mid fall semester at
the latest but the slides in August) and for Instructors (Not students. Sorry). Thank you again for
your excellent work, Madeleine and Matt. It is more appreciated than you could ever imagine.



And now to our reader. We hope you enjoy the book and please, if you see any issues whether
typographical, factual, or just want to suggest some type of addition to the material or another
way to describe a concept, general formatting suggestion, etc. please let us know. The beauty of
Open Education Resources (OER) is that we can literally make a minor change immediately and
without the need for expensive printings of a new edition. And it’s available for everyone right
away. If you have suggestions, please email them to either Alexis or myself (Lee Daffin) using
the emails on the title page.



Enjoy the 2nd edition of Abnormal Psychology.

                   Module 1: What is Abnormal Psychology?


Module Overview

        Cassie is an 18-year-old female from suburban Seattle, WA. She was a successful student

in high school, graduating valedictorian and obtaining a National Merit Scholarship for her

performance on the PSAT during her junior year. She was accepted to a university on the

opposite side of the state, where she received additional scholarships giving her a free ride for

her entire undergraduate education. Excited to start this new chapter in her life, Cassie’s parents

begin the 5-hour commute to Pullman, where they will leave their only daughter for the first time

in her life.

        The semester begins as it always does in late August. Cassie meets the challenge with

enthusiasm and does well in her classes for the first few weeks of the semester, as expected.

Sometime around Week 6, her friends notice she is despondent, detached, and falling behind in

her work. After being asked about her condition, she replies that she is “just a bit homesick,” and

her friends accept this answer as it is a typical response to leaving home and starting college for

many students. A month later, her condition has not improved but worsened. She now regularly

shirks her responsibilities around her apartment, in her classes, and on her job. Cassie does not

hang out with friends like she did when she first arrived for college and stays in bed most of the

day. Concerned, Cassie’s friends contact Health and Wellness for help.

        Cassie’s story, though hypothetical, is true of many Freshmen leaving home for the first

time to earn a higher education, whether in rural Washington state or urban areas such as

Chicago and Dallas. Most students recover from this depression and go on to be functional

members of their collegiate environment and accomplished scholars. Some students learn to cope

on their own while others seek assistance from their university’s health and wellness center or

from friends who have already been through the same ordeal. These are normal reactions.

However, in cases like Cassie's, the path to recovery is not as clear. Instead of learning how to

cope, their depression increases until it reaches clinical levels and becomes an impediment to

success in multiple domains of life such as home, work, school, and social circles.

       In Module 1, we will explore what it means to display abnormal behavior, what mental

disorders are, and how society views it both today and has throughout history. Then we will

review research methods used by psychologists in general and how they are adapted to study

abnormal behavior/mental disorders. We will conclude with an overview of what mental health

professionals do.

1.1.1. Understanding Abnormal Behavior

       To understand what abnormal behavior is, we first have to understand what normal

behavior is. Normal really is in the eye of the beholder, and most psychologists have found it

easier to explain what is wrong with people then what is right. How so?

       Psychology worked with the disease model for over 60 years, from about the late 1800s

into the middle part of the 19th century. The focus was simple – curing mental disorders - and

included such pioneers as Freud, Adler, Klein, Jung, and Erickson. These names are synonymous

with the psychoanalytical school of thought. In the 1930s, behaviorism, under B.F. Skinner,

presented a new view of human behavior. Simply, human behavior could be modified if the

correct combination of reinforcements and punishments were used. This viewpoint espoused the

dominant worldview of the time – mechanism – which presented the world as a great machine

explained through the principles of physics and chemistry. In it, human beings serve as smaller

machines in the larger machine of the universe.

       Moving into the mid to late 1900s, we developed a more scientific investigation of

mental illness, which allowed us to examine the roles of both nature and nurture and to develop

drug and psychological treatments to “make miserable people less miserable.” Though this was

an improvement, there were three consequences as pointed out by Martin Seligman in his 2008

TED Talk entitled, “The new era of positive psychology.” These are:

       •   “The first was moral; that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists,

           pathologizers; that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble, bricks

           fell on you. And we forgot that people made choices and decisions. We forgot

           responsibility. That was the first cost.”



                                                1-5
                                                                         2nd edition as of August 2020


       •   “The second cost was that we forgot about you people. We forgot about improving

           normal lives. We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people

           happier, more fulfilled, more productive. And "genius," "high-talent," became a dirty

           word. No one works on that.”

       •   “And the third problem about the disease model is, in our rush to do something about

           people in trouble, in our rush to do something about repairing damage, it never

           occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier -- positive

           interventions.”

       Starting in the 1960s, figures such as Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers sought to

overcome the limitations of psychoanalysis and behaviorism by establishing a "third force"

psychology, also known as humanistic psychology. As Maslow said,

       The science of psychology has been far more successful on the negative than on the

       positive side; it has revealed to us much about man’s shortcomings, his illnesses, his sins,

       but little about his potentialities, his virtues, his achievable aspirations, or his full

       psychological height. It is as if psychology had voluntarily restricted itself to only half its

       rightful jurisdiction, and that the darker, meaner half. (Maslow, 1954, p. 354).

Humanistic psychology instead addressed the full range of human functioning and focused on

personal fulfillment, valuing feelings over intellect, hedonism, a belief in human perfectibility,

emphasis on the present, self-disclosure, self-actualization, positive regard, client centered

therapy, and the hierarchy of needs. Again, these topics were in stark contrast to much of the

work being done in the field of psychology up to and at this time.

       In 1996, Martin Seligman became the president of the American Psychological

Association (APA) and called for a positive psychology or one that had a more positive

                                                  1-6
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


conception of human potential and nature. Building on Maslow and Roger’s work, he ushered in

the scientific study of such topics as happiness, love, hope, optimism, life satisfaction, goal

setting, leisure, and subjective well-being. Though positive and humanistic psychology have

similarities, their methodology was much different. While humanistic psychology generally

relied on qualitative methods, positive psychology utilizes a quantitative approach and aims to

help people make the most out of life’s setbacks, relate well to others, find fulfillment in

creativity, and find lasting meaning and satisfaction

(http://www.positivepsychologyinstitute.com.au/what_is_positive_psychology.html).

       So, to understand what normal behavior is, do we look to positive psychology for an

indication, or do we first define abnormal behavior and then reverse engineer a definition of what

normal is? Our preceding discussion gave suggestions about what normal behavior is, but could

the darker elements of our personality also make up what is normal to some extent? Possibly.

The one truth is that no matter what behavior we display, if taken to the extreme, it can become

disordered – whether trying to control others through social influence or helping people in an

altruistic fashion. As such, we can consider abnormal behavior to be a combination of personal

distress, psychological dysfunction, deviance from social norms, dangerousness to self and

others, and costliness to society.



1.1.2. How do we determine what abnormal behavior is?

       In the previous section we showed that what we might consider normal behavior is

difficult to define. Equally challenging is understanding what abnormal behavior is, which may

be surprising to you. A publication which you will become intimately familiar with throughout

this book, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental

                                                 1-7
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5), states that though "no definition can capture all aspects of all

disorders in the range contained in the DSM-5" certain aspects are required. These include:

       •   Dysfunction – Includes “clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s

           cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the

           psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning”

           (pg. 20). Abnormal behavior, therefore, has the capacity to make well-being difficult

           to obtain and can be assessed by looking at an individual’s current performance and

           comparing it to what is expected in general or how the person has performed in the

           past. As such, a good employee who suddenly demonstrates poor performance may

           be experiencing an environmental demand leading to stress and ineffective coping

           mechanisms. Once the demand resolves itself, the person’s performance should return

           to normal according to this principle.

       •   Distress – When the person experiences a disabling condition “in social,

           occupational, or other important activities” (pg. 20). Distress can take the form of

           psychological or physical pain, or both concurrently. Alone though, distress is not

           sufficient enough to describe behavior as abnormal. Why is that? The loss of a loved

           one would cause even the most “normally” functioning individual pain. An athlete

           who experiences a career-ending injury would display distress as well. Suffering is

           part of life and cannot be avoided. And some people who exhibit abnormal behavior

           are generally positive while doing so.

       •   Deviance – Closer examination of the word abnormal indicates a move away from

           what is normal, or the mean (i.e., what would be considered average and in this case

           in relation to behavior), and so is behavior that infrequently occurs (sort of an outlier

                                                1-8
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


           in our data). Our culture, or the totality of socially transmitted behaviors, customs,

           values, technology, attitudes, beliefs, art, and other products that are particular to a

           group, determines what is normal. Thus, a person is said to be deviant when he or she

           fails to follow the stated and unstated rules of society, called social norms. Social

           norms changes over time due to shifts in accepted values and expectations. For

           instance, homosexuality was taboo in the U.S. just a few decades ago, but today, it is

           generally accepted. Likewise, PDAs, or public displays of affection, do not cause a

           second look by most people unlike the past when these outward expressions of love

           were restricted to the privacy of one’s own house or bedroom. In the U.S., crying is

           generally seen as a weakness for males. However, if the behavior occurs in the

           context of a tragedy such as the Vegas mass shooting on October 1, 2017, in which 58

           people were killed and about 500 were wounded while attending the Route 91

           Harvest Festival, then it is appropriate and understandable. Finally, consider that

           statistically deviant behavior is not necessarily negative. Genius is an example of

           behavior that is not the norm.

       Though not part of the DSM conceptualization of what abnormal behavior is, many

clinicians add dangerousness to this list when behavior represents a threat to the safety of the

person or others. It is important to note that having a mental disorder does not imply a person is

automatically dangerous. The depressed or anxious individual is often no more a threat than

someone who is not depressed, and as Hiday and Burns (2010) showed, dangerousness is more

the exception than the rule. Still, mental health professionals have a duty to report to law

enforcement when a mentally disordered individual expresses intent to harm another person or



                                                 1-9

themselves. It is important to point out that people seen as dangerous are also not automatically

mentally ill.



1.1.3. The Costs of Mental Illness

        This leads us to wonder what the cost of mental illness is to society. The National

Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) indicates that depression is the number one cause of

disability across the world “and is a major contributor to the global burden of disease.” Serious

mental illness costs the United States an estimated $193 billion in lost earnings each year. They

also point out that suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S., and 90% of those who

die due to suicide have an underlying mental illness. Regarding children and teens, 37% of

students with a mental disorder age 14 and older drop out of school, which is the highest dropout

rate of any disability group, and 70% of youth in state and local juvenile justice systems have at

least one mental disorder. Source: https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-By-the-

Numbers. In terms of worldwide impact, the World Economic Forum used 2010 data to estimate

$2.5 trillion in global costs in 2010 and projected costs of $6 trillion by 2030. The costs for

mental illness are greater than the combined costs of cancer, diabetes, and respiratory disorders

(Whiteford et al., 2013). And finally, “The Social Security Administration reports that in 2012,

2.6 and 2.7 million people under age 65 with a mental illness-related disability received SSI and

SSDI payments, respectively, which represents 43 and 27 percent of the total number of people

receiving such support, respectively” (Source:

https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/directors/thomas-insel/blog/2015/mental-health-awareness-

month-by-the-numbers.shtml). So as you can see, the cost of mental illness is quite staggering

for both the United States and other countries.

1.1.4. Definition of abnormal psychology or psychopathology

       Our discussion so far has concerned what normal and abnormal behavior is. We saw that

the study of normal behavior falls under the providence of positive psychology. Similarly, the

scientific study of abnormal behavior, with the intent to be able to predict reliably, explain,

diagnose, identify the causes of, and treat maladaptive behavior, is what we refer to as abnormal

psychology. Abnormal behavior can become pathological and has led to the scientific study of

psychological disorders, or psychopathology. From our previous discussion we can fashion the

following definition of a psychological or mental disorder: mental disorders are characterized

by psychological dysfunction, which causes physical and/or psychological distress or impaired

functioning, and is not an expected behavior according to societal or cultural standards.

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   Abnormal behavior is a combination of personal distress, psychological
       dysfunction, deviance from social norms, dangerousness to self and others,
       and costliness to society.
   •   Abnormal psychology is the scientific study of abnormal behavior, with the
       intent to be able to predict reliably, explain, diagnose, identify the causes
       of, and treat maladaptive behavior.
   •   The study of psychological disorders is called psychopathology.
   •   Mental disorders are characterized by psychological dysfunction, which
       causes physical and/or psychological distress or impaired functioning, and
       is not an expected behavior according to societal or cultural standards.

                               1.2. Classifying Mental Disorders



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Define and exemplify classification.

       •   Define nomenclature.

       •   Define epidemiology.

       •   Define the presenting problem and clinical description.

       •   Differentiate prevalence, incidence, and any subtypes.

       •   Define comorbidity.

       •   Define etiology.

       •   Define course.

       •   Define prognosis.

       •   Define treatment.



       Classification is not a foreign concept and as a student you have likely taken at least one

biology class that discussed the taxonomic classification system of Kingdom, Phylum, Class,

Order, Family, Genus, and Species revolutionized by Swedish botanist, Carl Linnaeus. You

probably even learned a witty mnemonic such as ‘King Phillip, Come Out For Goodness Sake’

to keep the order straight. The Library of Congress uses classification to organize and arrange

their book collections and includes such categories as B – Philosophy, Psychology, and Religion;

H – Social Sciences; N – Fine Arts; Q – Science; R – Medicine; and T – Technology.

       Simply, classification is how we organize or categorize things. The second author’s wife

has been known to color-code her DVD collection by genre, movie title, and release date. It is
                                               1-13

useful for us to do the same with abnormal behavior, and classification provides us with a

nomenclature, or naming system, to structure our understanding of mental disorders in a

meaningful way. Of course, we want to learn as much as we can about a given disorder so we

can understand its cause, predict its future occurrence, and develop ways to treat it.

       Epidemiology is the scientific study of the frequency and causes of diseases and other

health-related states in specific populations such as a school, neighborhood, a city, country, and

the world. Psychiatric or mental health epidemiology refers to the occurrence of mental

disorders in a population. In mental health facilities, we say that a patient presents with a specific

problem, or the presenting problem, and we give a clinical description of it, which includes

information about the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that constitute that mental disorder. We

also seek to gain information about the occurrence of the disorder, its cause, course, and

treatment possibilities.

       Occurrence can be investigated in several ways. First, prevalence is the percentage of

people in a population that has a mental disorder or can be viewed as the number of cases

divided by the total number of people in the sample. For instance, if 20 people out of 100 have

bipolar disorder, then the prevalence rate is 20%. Prevalence can be measured in several ways:

       •   Point prevalence indicates the proportion of a population that has the characteristic

           at a specific point in time. In other words, it is the number of active cases.

       •   Period prevalence indicates the proportion of a population that has the characteristic

           at any point during a given period of time, typically the past year.

       •   Lifetime prevalence indicates the proportion of a population that has had the

           characteristic at any time during their lives.

       According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), in 2015 there was

an estimated 9.8 million U.S. adults aged 18 years or older with a serious mental illness, or 4%

of all U.S. adults, and 43.4 million adults aged 18 years or older with any mental illness, or

17.9% of all U.S. adults.

            Source: https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/index.shtml



       Incidence indicates the number of new cases in a population over a specific period. This

measure is usually lower since it does not include existing cases as prevalence does. If you wish

to know the number of new cases of social phobia during the past year (going from say Aug 21,

2015 to Aug 20, 2016), you would only count cases that began during this time and ignore cases

before the start date, even if people are currently afflicted with the mental disorder. Incidence is

often studied by medical and public health officials so that causes can be identified, and future

cases prevented.

       Finally, comorbidity describes when two or more mental disorders are occurring at the

same time and in the same person. The National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) study

conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and published in the June 6, 2005

issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, sought to discover trends in prevalence, impairment,

and service use during the 1990s. The first study, conducted from 1980 to 1985, surveyed 20,000

people from five different geographical regions in the U.S. A second study followed from 1990-

1992 and was called the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS). The third study, the NCS-R, used

a new nationally representative sample of the U.S. population, and found that 45% of those with

one mental disorder met the diagnostic criteria for two or more disorders. The authors also found

that the severity of mental illness, in regard to disability, is strongly related to comorbidity, and

that substance use disorders often result from disorders such as anxiety and bipolar mood

disorders. The implications of this are significant as services to treat substance abuse and mental

disorders are often separate, despite the disorders appearing together.

        The etiology is the cause of the disorder. There may be social, biological, or

psychological explanations for the disorder which need to be understood to identify the

appropriate treatment. Likewise, the effectiveness of a treatment may give some hint at the cause

of the mental disorder. More on this later.

        The course of the disorder is its particular pattern. A disorder may be acute, meaning that

it lasts a short time, or chronic, meaning it persists for a long time. It can also be classified as

time-limited, meaning that recovery will occur after some time regardless of whether any

treatment occurs.

        Prognosis is the anticipated course the mental disorder will take. A key factor in

determining the course is age, with some disorders presenting differently in childhood than

adulthood.

        Finally, we will discuss several treatment strategies in this book in relation to specific

disorders, and in a general fashion in Module 3. Treatment is any procedure intended to modify

abnormal behavior into normal behavior. The person suffering from the mental disorder seeks

the assistance of a trained professional to provide some degree of relief over a series of therapy

sessions. The trained mental health professional may prescribe medication or utilize

psychotherapy to bring about this change. Treatment may be sought from the primary care

provider, in an outpatient facility, or through inpatient care or hospitalization at a mental hospital

or psychiatric unit of a general hospital.

                              1.3. The Stigma of Mental Illness



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Clarify the importance of social cognition theory in understanding why people do not

           seek care.

       •    Define categories and schemas.

       •   Define stereotypes and heuristics.

       •   Describe social identity theory and its consequences.

       •   Differentiate between prejudice and discrimination.

       •   Contrast implicit and explicit attitudes.

       •   Explain the concept of stigma and its three forms.

       •   Define courtesy stigma.

       •   Describe what the literature shows about stigma.



       In the previous section, we discussed the fact that care can be sought out in a variety of

ways. The problem is that many people who need care never seek it out. Why is that? We

already know that society dictates what is considered abnormal behavior through culture and

social norms, and you can likely think of a few implications of that. But to fully understand

society’s role in why people do not seek care, we need to determine the psychological processes

underlying this phenomenon in the individual.

       Social cognition is the process through which we collect information from the world

around us and then interpret it. The collection process occurs through what we know as sensation

– or detecting physical energy emitted or reflected by physical objects. Detection occurs courtesy
                                                1-18
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


of our eyes, ears, nose, skin and mouth; or via vision, hearing, smell, touch, and taste,

respectfully. Once collected, the information is relayed to the brain through the neural impulse

where it is processed and interpreted, or meaning is added to this raw sensory data which we call

perception.

       One way meaning is added is by taking the information we just detected and using it to

assign people to categories, or groups. For each category, we have a schema, or a set of beliefs

and expectations about a group of people, believed to apply to all members of the group, and

based on experience. You might think of them as organized ways of making sense of experience.

So it is during our initial interaction with someone that we collect information about him/her,

assign the person to a category for which we have a schema, and then use that to affect how we

interact with her or him. First impressions, called the primacy effect, are important because even

if we obtain new information that should override an incorrect initial assessment, the initial

impression is unlikely to change. We call this the perseverance effect, or belief perseverance.

       Stereotypes are special types of schemas that are very simplistic, very strongly held, and

not based on firsthand experience. They are heuristics, or mental shortcuts, that allow us to

assess this collected information very quickly. One piece of information, such as skin color, can

be used to assign the person to a schema for which we have a stereotype. This can affect how we

think or feel about the person and behave toward them. Again, human beings tend to imply

things about an individual solely due to a distinguishing feature and disregard anything

inconsistent with the stereotype.

       Social identity theory (Tajfel, 1982; Turner, 1987) states that people categorize their

social world into meaningfully simplistic representations of groups of people. These

representations are then organized as prototypes, or “fuzzy sets of a relatively limited number of

                                                1-19
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


category-defining features that not only define one category but serve to distinguish it from other

categories” (Foddy and Hogg, as cited in Foddy et al., 1999). We construct in-groups and out-

groups and categorize the self as an in-group member. The self is assimilated into the salient in-

group prototype, which indicates what cognitions, affect, and behavior we may exhibit.

Stereotyping, out-group homogeneity, in-group/out-group bias, normative behavior, and

conformity are all based on self-categorization.

       How so? Out-group homogeneity occurs when we see all members of an outside group as

the same. This leads to a tendency to show favoritism to, and exclude or hold a negative view of,

members outside of, one’s immediate group, called the in-group/out-group bias. The negative

view or set of beliefs about a group of people is what we call prejudice, and this can result in

acting in a way that is negative against a group of people, called discrimination. It should be

noted that a person can be prejudicial without being discriminatory since most people do not act

on their attitudes toward others due to social norms against such behavior. Likewise, a person or

institution can be discriminatory without being prejudicial. For example, when a company

requires that an applicant have a certain education level or be able to lift 80 pounds as part of

typical job responsibilities. Individuals without a degree or ability to lift will be removed from

consideration for the job, but this discriminatory act does not mean that the company has

negative views of people without degrees or the inability to lift heavy weight. You might even

hold a negative view of a specific group of people and not be aware of it. An attitude we are

unaware of is called an implicit attitude, which stands in contrast to explicit attitudes, which are

the views within our conscious awareness.

       We have spent quite a lot of space and time understanding how people gather information

about the world and people around them, process this information, use it to make snap

                                                1-20
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


judgements about others, form groups for which stereotypes may exist, and then potentially hold

negative views of this group and behave negatively toward them as a result. Just one piece of

information can be used to set this series of mental events into motion. Outside of skin color, the

label associated with having a mental disorder can be used. Stereotypes about people with a

mental disorder can quickly and easily transform into prejudice when people in a society

determine the schema to be correct and form negative emotions and evaluations of this group

(Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). This, in turn, can lead to discriminatory practices such as an employer

refusing to hire, a landlord refusing to rent an apartment, or avoiding a romantic relationship, all

due to the person having a mental illness.

       Overlapping with prejudice and discrimination in terms of how people with mental

disorders are treated is stigma, or when negative stereotyping, labeling, rejection, and loss of

status occur. Stigma takes on three forms as described below:

       •   Public stigma – When members of a society endorse negative stereotypes of people

           with a mental disorder and discriminate against them. They might avoid them

           altogether, resulting in social isolation. An example is when an employer

           intentionally does not hire a person because their mental illness is discovered.

       •   Label avoidance –To avoid being labeled as “crazy” or “nuts” people needing care

           may avoid seeking it altogether or stop care once started. Due to these labels, funding

           for mental health services could be restricted and instead, physical health services

           funded.

       •   Self-stigma – When people with mental illnesses internalize the negative stereotypes

           and prejudice, and in turn, discriminate against themselves. They may experience

           shame, reduced self-esteem, hopelessness, low self-efficacy, and a reduction in

                                                1-21
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


           coping mechanisms. An obvious consequence of these potential outcomes is the why

           try effect, or the person saying ‘Why should I try and get that job? I am not worthy of

           it’ (Corrigan, Larson, & Rusch, 2009; Corrigan, et al., 2016).

       Another form of stigma that is worth noting is that of courtesy stigma or when stigma

affects people associated with a person who has a mental disorder. Karnieli-Miller et al. (2013)

found that families of the afflicted were often blamed, rejected, or devalued when others learned

that a family member had a serious mental illness (SMI). Due to this, they felt hurt and betrayed,

and an important source of social support during a difficult time had disappeared, resulting in

greater levels of stress. To cope, some families concealed their relative’s illness, and some

parents struggled to decide whether it was their place to disclose their child’s condition. Others

fought with the issue of confronting the stigma through attempts at education versus just ignoring

it due to not having enough energy or desiring to maintain personal boundaries. There was also a

need to understand the responses of others and to attribute it to a lack of knowledge, experience,

and/or media coverage. In some cases, the reappraisal allowed family members to feel

compassion for others rather than feeling put down or blamed. The authors concluded that each

family “develops its own coping strategies which vary according to its personal experiences,

values, and extent of other commitments” and that “coping strategies families employ change

over-time.”

       Other effects of stigma include experiencing work-related discrimination resulting in

higher levels of self-stigma and stress (Rusch et al., 2014), higher rates of suicide especially

when treatment is not available (Rusch, Zlati, Black, and Thornicroft, 2014; Rihmer & Kiss,

2002), and a decreased likelihood of future help-seeking intention (Lally et al., 2013). The results

of the latter study also showed that personal contact with someone with a history of mental

                                                1-22
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


illness led to a decreased likelihood of seeking help. This is important because 48% of the

university sample stated that they needed help for an emotional or mental health issue during the

past year but did not seek help. Similar results have been reported in other studies (Eisenberg,

Downs, Golberstein, & Zivin, 2009). It is also important to point out that social distance, a result

of stigma, has also been shown to increase throughout the life span, suggesting that anti-stigma

campaigns should focus on older people primarily (Schomerus, et al., 2015).

        One potentially disturbing trend is that mental health professionals have been shown to

hold negative attitudes toward the people they serve. Hansson et al. (2011) found that staff

members at an outpatient clinic in the southern part of Sweden held the most negative attitudes

about whether an employer would accept an applicant for work, willingness to date a person who

had been hospitalized, and hiring a patient to care for children. Attitudes were stronger when

staff treated patients with a psychosis or in inpatient settings. In a similar study,

Martensson, Jacobsson, and Engstrom (2014) found that staff had more positive attitudes

towards persons with mental illness if their knowledge of such disorders was less stigmatized;

their workplaces were in the county council where they were more likely to encounter patients

who recover and return to normal life in society, rather than in municipalities where patients

have long-term and recurrent mental illness; and they have or had one close friend with mental

health issues.

        To help deal with stigma in the mental health community, Papish et al. (2013)

investigated the effect of a one-time contact-based educational intervention compared to a four-

week mandatory psychiatry course on the stigma of mental illness among medical students at the

University of Calgary. The curriculum included two methods requiring contact with people

diagnosed with a mental disorder: patient presentations, or two one-hour oral presentations in

                                                 1-23
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


which patients shared their story of having a mental illness, and "clinical correlations" in which a

psychiatrist mentored students while they interacted with patients in either inpatient or outpatient

settings. Results showed that medical students held a stigma towards mental illness and that

comprehensive medical education reduced this stigma. As the authors stated, “These results

suggest that it is possible to create an environment in which medical student attitudes towards

mental illness can be shifted in a positive direction.” That said, the level of stigma was still

higher for mental illness than it was for the stigmatized physical illness, type 2 diabetes mellitus.

       What might happen if mental illness is presented as a treatable condition? McGinty,

Goldman, Pescosolido, and Barry (2015) found that portraying schizophrenia, depression, and

heroin addiction as untreated and symptomatic increased negative public attitudes towards

people with these conditions. Conversely, when the same people were portrayed as successfully

treated, the desire for social distance was reduced, there was less willingness to discriminate

against them, and belief in treatment effectiveness increased among the public.

       Self-stigma has also been shown to affect self-esteem, which then affects hope, which

then affects the quality of life among people with SMI. As such, hope should play a central role

in recovery (Mashiach-Eizenberg et al., 2013). Narrative Enhancement and Cognitive Therapy

(NECT) is an intervention designed to reduce internalized stigma and targets both hope and self-

esteem (Yanos et al., 2011). The intervention replaces stigmatizing myths with facts about illness

and recovery, which leads to hopefulness and higher levels of self-esteem in clients. This may

then reduce susceptibility to internalized stigma.

       Stigma leads to health inequities (Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, & Link, 2013), prompting calls

for stigma change. Targeting stigma involves two different agendas: The services agenda

attempts to remove stigma so people can seek mental health services, and the rights agenda tries

                                                 1-24

to replace discrimination that “robs people of rightful opportunities with affirming attitudes and

behavior” (Corrigan, 2016). The former is successful when there is evidence that people with

mental illness are seeking services more or becoming better engaged. The latter is successful

when there is an increase in the number of people with mental illnesses in the workforce who are

receiving reasonable accommodations. The federal government has tackled this issue with

landmark legislation such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, Mental

Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of

1990. However, protections are not uniform across all subgroups due to “1) explicit language

about inclusion and exclusion criteria in the statute or implementation rule, 2) vague statutory

language that yields variation in the interpretation about which groups qualify for protection, and

3) incentives created by the legislation that affect specific groups differently” (Cummings,

Lucas, and Druss, 2013). More on this in Module 15.




   You should have learned the following in this section:
       •    Stigma is when negative stereotyping, labeling, rejection, and loss of status occur
            and take the form of public or self-stigma, and label avoidance.

       As we have seen so far, what is considered abnormal behavior is often dictated by the

culture/society a person lives in, and unfortunately, the past has not treated the afflicted very

well. In this section, we will examine how past societies viewed and dealt with mental illness.



1.4.1. Prehistoric and Ancient Beliefs

       Prehistoric cultures often held a supernatural view of abnormal behavior and saw it as the

work of evil spirits, demons, gods, or witches who took control of the person. This form of
                                                1-26

demonic possession often occurred when the person engaged in behavior contrary to the

religious teachings of the time. Treatment by cave dwellers included a technique called

trephination, in which a stone instrument known as a trephine was used to remove part of the

skull, creating an opening. Through it, the evil spirits could escape, thereby ending the person’s

mental affliction and returning them to normal behavior. Early Greek, Hebrew, Egyptian, and

Chinese cultures used a treatment method called exorcism in which evil spirts were cast out

through prayer, magic, flogging, starvation, having the person ingest horrible tasting drinks, or

noisemaking.



1.4.2. Greco-Roman Thought

       Rejecting the idea of demonic possession, Greek physician Hippocrates (460-377 B.C.)

said that mental disorders were akin to physical ailments and had natural causes. Specifically,

they arose from brain pathology, or head trauma/brain dysfunction or disease, and were also

affected by heredity. Hippocrates classified mental disorders into three main categories –

melancholia, mania, and phrenitis (brain fever) – and gave detailed clinical descriptions of each.

He also described four main fluids or humors that directed normal brain functioning and

personality – blood which arose in the heart, black bile arising in the spleen, yellow bile or choler

from the liver, and phlegm from the brain. Mental disorders occurred when the humors were in a

state of imbalance such as an excess of yellow bile causing frenzy and too much black bile

causing melancholia or depression. Hippocrates believed mental illnesses could be treated as any

other disorder and focused on the underlying pathology.

       Also noteworthy was the Greek philosopher Plato (429-347 B.C.), who said that the

mentally ill were not responsible for their actions and should not be punished. It was the

                                                1-27
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


responsibility of the community and their families to care for them. The Greek physician Galen

(A.D. 129-199) said mental disorders had either physical or psychological causes, including fear,

shock, alcoholism, head injuries, adolescence, and changes in menstruation.

       In Rome, physician Asclepiades (124-40 BC) and philosopher Cicero (106-43 BC)

rejected Hippocrates’ idea of the four humors and instead stated that melancholy arises from

grief, fear, and rage; not excess black bile. Roman physicians treated mental disorders with

massage or warm baths, the hope being that their patients would be as comfortable as they could

be. They practiced the concept of contrariis contrarius, meaning opposite by opposite, and

introduced contrasting stimuli to bring about balance in the physical and mental domains. An

example would be consuming a cold drink while in a warm bath.



1.4.3. The Middle Ages – 500 AD to 1500 AD

       The progress made during the time of the Greeks and Romans was quickly reversed

during the Middle Ages with the increase in power of the Church and the fall of the Roman

Empire. Mental illness was yet again explained as possession by the Devil and methods such as

exorcism, flogging, prayer, the touching of relics, chanting, visiting holy sites, and holy water

were used to rid the person of demonic influence. In extreme cases, the afflicted were exposed to

confinement, beatings, and even execution. Scientific and medical explanations, such as those

proposed by Hippocrates, were discarded.

       Group hysteria, or mass madness, was also seen when large numbers of people displayed

similar symptoms and false beliefs. This included the belief that one was possessed by wolves or

other animals and imitated their behavior, called lycanthropy, and a mania in which large

numbers of people had an uncontrollable desire to dance and jump, called tarantism. The latter

                                                1-28
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


was believed to have been caused by the bite of the wolf spider, now called the tarantula, and

spread quickly from Italy to Germany and other parts of Europe where it was called Saint

Vitus’s dance.

       Perhaps the return to supernatural explanations during the Middle Ages makes sense

given events of the time. The black death (bubonic plague) killed up to a third, or according to

other estimates almost half, of the population. Famine, war, social oppression, and pestilence

were also factors. The constant presence of death led to an epidemic of depression and fear. Near

the end of the Middle Ages, mystical explanations for mental illness began to lose favor, and

government officials regained some of their lost power over nonreligious activities. Science and

medicine were again called upon to explain psychopathology.



1.4.4. The Renaissance - 14th to 16th centuries

       The most noteworthy development in the realm of philosophy during the Renaissance

was the rise of humanism, or the worldview that emphasizes human welfare and the uniqueness

of the individual. This perspective helped continue the decline of supernatural views of mental

illness. In the mid to late 1500s, German physician Johann Weyer (1515-1588) published his

book, On the Deceits of the Demons, that rebutted the Church’s witch-hunting handbook, the

Malleus Maleficarum, and argued that many accused of being witches and subsequently

imprisoned, tortured, and/or burned at the stake, were mentally disturbed and not possessed by

demons or the Devil himself. He believed that like the body, the mind was susceptible to illness.

Not surprisingly, the book was vehemently protested and banned by the Church. It should be

noted that these types of acts occurred not only in Europe, but also in the United States. The most

famous example, the Salem Witch Trials of 1692, resulted in more than 200 people accused of

practicing witchcraft and 20 deaths.

       The number of asylums, or places of refuge for the mentally ill where they could receive

care, began to rise during the 16th century as the government realized there were far too many

people afflicted with mental illness to be left in private homes. Hospitals and monasteries were

converted into asylums. Though the intent was benign in the beginning, as the facilities

overcrowded, the patients came to be treated more like animals than people. In 1547, the

Bethlem Hospital opened in London with the sole purpose of confining those with mental

disorders. Patients were chained up, placed on public display, and often heard crying out in pain.

The asylum became a tourist attraction, with sightseers paying a penny to view the more violent

patients, and soon was called “Bedlam” by local people; a term that today means “a state of

uproar and confusion” (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bedlam).



1.4.5. Reform Movement – 18th to 19th centuries

       The rise of the moral treatment movement occurred in Europe in the late 18th century

and then in the United States in the early 19th century. The earliest proponent was Francis Pinel

(1745-1826), the superintendent of la Bicetre, a hospital for mentally ill men in Paris. Pinel

stressed respectful treatment and moral guidance for the mentally ill while considering their

individual, social, and occupational needs. Arguing that the mentally ill were sick people, Pinel

ordered that chains be removed, outside exercise be allowed, sunny and well-ventilated rooms

replace dungeons, and patients be extended kindness and support. This approach led to

considerable improvement for many of the patients, so much so, that several were released.



                                               1-30
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


        Following Pinel’s lead, William Tuke (1732-1822), a Quaker tea merchant, established a

pleasant rural estate called the York Retreat. The Quakers believed that all people should be

accepted for who they are and treated kindly. At the retreat, patients could work, rest, talk out

their problems, and pray (Raad & Makari, 2010). The work of Tuke and others led to the passage

of the Country Asylums Act of 1845, which required that every county provide asylum to the

mentally ill. This sentiment extended to English colonies such as Canada, India, Australia, and

the West Indies as word of the maltreatment of patients at a facility in Kingston, Jamaica spread,

leading to an audit of colonial facilities and their policies.

        Reform in the United States started with the figure largely considered to be the father of

American psychiatry, Benjamin Rush (1745-1813). Rush advocated for the humane treatment of

the mentally ill, showing them respect, and even giving them small gifts from time to time.

Despite this, his practice included treatments such as bloodletting and purgatives, the invention

of the “tranquilizing chair,” and reliance on astrology, showing that even he could not escape

from the beliefs of the time.

        Due to the rise of the moral treatment movement in both Europe and the United States,

asylums became habitable places where those afflicted with mental illness could recover.

Regrettably, its success was responsible for its decline. The number of mental hospitals greatly

increased, leading to staffing shortages and a lack of funds to support them. Though treating

patients humanely was a noble endeavor, it did not work for some patients and other treatments

were needed, though they had not been developed yet. Staff recognized that the approach worked

best when the facility had 200 or fewer patients, but waves of immigrants arriving in the U.S.

after the Civil War overwhelmed the facilities, and patient counts soared to 1,000 or more.

Prejudice against the new arrivals led to discriminatory practices in which immigrants were not

afforded the same moral treatments as native citizens, even when the resources were available to

treat them.

       The moral treatment movement also fell due to the rise of the mental hygiene

movement, which focused on the physical well-being of patients. Its leading proponent in the

United States was Dorothea Dix (1802-1887), a New Englander who observed the deplorable

conditions suffered by the mentally ill while teaching Sunday school to female prisoners. Over

the next 40 years, from 1841 to 1881, she motivated people and state legislators to do something

about this injustice and raised millions of dollars to build over 30 more appropriate mental

hospitals and improve others. Her efforts even extended beyond the U.S. to Canada and

Scotland.

       Finally, in 1908 Clifford Beers (1876-1943) published his book, A Mind that Found

Itself, in which he described his struggle with bipolar disorder and the “cruel and inhumane

treatment people with mental illnesses received. He witnessed and experienced horrific abuse at

the hands of his caretakers. At one point during his institutionalization, he was placed in a

straightjacket for 21 consecutive nights” (http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/our-history). His

story aroused sympathy from the public and led him to found the National Committee for Mental

Hygiene, known today as Mental Health America, which provides education about mental illness

and the need to treat these people with dignity. Today, MHA has over 200 affiliates in 41 states

and employs 6,500 affiliate staff and over 10,000 volunteers.

               “In the early 1950s, Mental Health America issued a call to asylums

               across the country for their discarded chains and shackles. On April 13,

               1953, at the McShane Bell Foundry in Baltimore, Md., Mental Health

               America melted down these inhumane bindings and recast them into a

               sign of hope: the Mental Health Bell.

               Now the symbol of Mental Health America, the 300-pound Bell serves as

               a powerful reminder that the invisible chains of misunderstanding and

               discrimination continue to bind people with mental illnesses. Today, the

               Mental Health Bell rings out hope for improving mental health and

               achieving victory over mental illnesses.”

1.4.6. 20th – 21st Centuries

       The decline of the moral treatment approach in the late 19th century led to the rise of two

competing perspectives – the biological or somatogenic perspective and the psychological or

psychogenic perspective.

   1.4.6.1. Biological or Somatogenic Perspective. Recall that Greek physicians Hippocrates

and Galen said that mental disorders were akin to physical disorders and had natural causes.

Though the idea fell into oblivion for several centuries, it re-emerged in the late 19th century for

two reasons. First, German psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) discovered that symptoms

occurred regularly in clusters, which he called syndromes. These syndromes represented a

unique mental disorder with a distinct cause, course, and prognosis. In 1883 he published his

textbook, Compendium der Psychiatrie (Textbook of Psychiatry), and described a system for

classifying mental disorders that became the basis of the American Psychiatric Association’s

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) that is currently in its 5th edition

(published in 2013).

                                                1-33
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


       Secondly, in 1825, the behavioral and cognitive symptoms of advanced syphilis were

identified to include a belief that everyone is plotting against you or that you are God (a delusion

of grandeur), and were termed general paresis by French physician A.L.J. Bayle. In 1897,

Viennese psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebbing injected patients suffering from general paresis

with matter from syphilis spores and noted that none of the patients developed symptoms of

syphilis, indicating they must have been previously exposed and were now immune. This led to

the conclusion that syphilis was the cause of the general paresis. In 1906, August von

Wassermann developed a blood test for syphilis, and in 1917 a cure was found. Julius von

Wagner-Jauregg noticed that patients with general paresis who contracted malaria recovered

from their symptoms. To test this hypothesis, he injected nine patients with blood from a soldier

afflicted with malaria. Three of the patients fully recovered while three others showed great

improvement in their paretic symptoms. The high fever caused by malaria burned out the

syphilis bacteria. Hospitals in the United States began incorporating this new cure for paresis

into their treatment approach by 1925.

       Also noteworthy was the work of American psychiatrist John P. Grey. Appointed as

superintendent of the Utica State Hospital in New York, Grey asserted that insanity always had a

physical cause. As such, the mentally ill should be seen as physically ill and treated with rest,

proper room temperature and ventilation, and a nutritive diet.

       The 1930s also saw the use of electric shock as a treatment method, which was stumbled

upon accidentally by Benjamin Franklin while experimenting with electricity in the early 18th

century. He noticed that after suffering a severe shock his memories had changed, and in

published work, he suggested physicians study electric shock as a treatment for melancholia.



                                                1-34
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


       1.4.6.2. Psychological or Psychogenic Perspective. The psychological or psychogenic

perspective states that emotional or psychological factors are the cause of mental disorders and

represented a challenge to the biological perspective. This perspective had a long history but did

not gain favor until the work of Viennese physician Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815).

Influenced heavily by Newton’s theory of gravity, he believed that the planets also affected the

human body through the force of animal magnetism and that all people had a universal magnetic

fluid that determined how healthy they were. He demonstrated the usefulness of his approach

when he cured Franzl Oesterline, a 27-year-old woman suffering from what he described as a

convulsive malady. Mesmer used a magnet to disrupt the gravitational tides that were affecting

his patient and produced a sensation of the magnetic fluid draining from her body. This

procedure removed the illness from her body and provided a near-instantaneous recovery. In

reality, the patient was placed in a trancelike state which made her highly suggestible. With other

patients, Mesmer would have them sit in a darkened room filled with soothing music, into which

he would enter dressed in a colorful robe and pass from person to person touching the afflicted

area of their body with his hand or a rod/wand. He successfully cured deafness, paralysis, loss of

bodily feeling, convulsions, menstrual difficulties, and blindness.

       His approach gained him celebrity status as he demonstrated it at the courts of English

nobility. However, the medical community was hardly impressed. A royal commission was

formed to investigate his technique but could not find any proof for his theory of animal

magnetism. Though he was able to cure patients when they touched his “magnetized” tree, the

result was the same when “non-magnetized” trees were touched. As such, Mesmer was deemed a

charlatan and forced to leave Paris. His technique was called mesmerism, better known today as

hypnosis.

                                               1-35
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


       The psychological perspective gained popularity after two physicians practicing in the

city of Nancy in France discovered that they could induce the symptoms of hysteria in perfectly

healthy patients through hypnosis and then remove the symptoms in the same way. The work of

Hippolyte-Marie Bernheim (1840-1919) and Ambroise-Auguste Liebault (1823-1904) came to

be part of what was called the Nancy School and showed that hysteria was nothing more than a

form of self-hypnosis. In Paris, this view was challenged by Jean Charcot (1825-1893), who

stated that hysteria was caused by degenerative brain changes, reflecting the biological

perspective. He was proven wrong and eventually turned to their way of thinking.

       The use of hypnosis to treat hysteria was also carried out by fellow Frenchman Pierre

Janet (1859-1947), and student of Charcot, who believed that hysteria had psychological, not

biological causes. Namely, these included unconscious forces, fixed ideas, and memory

impairments. In Vienna, Josef Breuer (1842-1925) induced hypnosis and had patients speak

freely about past events that upset them. Upon waking, he discovered that patients sometimes

were free of their symptoms of hysteria. Success was even greater when patients not only

recalled forgotten memories but also relived them emotionally. He called this the cathartic

method, and our use of the word catharsis today indicates a purging or release, in this case, of

pent-up emotion.

       By the end of the 19th century, it had become evident that mental disorders were caused

by a combination of biological and psychological factors, and the investigation of how they

develop began. Sigmund Freud’s development of psychoanalysis followed on the heels of the

work of Bruner, and others who came before him.

1.4.7. Current Views/Trends

       1.4.7.1. Mental illness today. An article published by the Harvard Medical School in

March 2014 called “The Prevalent and Treatment of Mental Illness Today” presented the results

of the National Comorbidity Study Replication of 2001-2003, which included a sample of more

than 9,000 adults. The results showed that nearly 46% of the participants had a psychiatric

disorder at some time in their lives. The most commonly reported disorders were:

       •   Major depression – 17%

       •   Alcohol abuse – 13%

       •   Social anxiety disorder – 12%

       •   Conduct disorder – 9.5%

Also of interest was that women were more likely to have had anxiety and mood disorders while

men showed higher rates of impulse control disorders. Comorbid anxiety and mood disorders

were common, and 28% reported having more than one co-occurring disorder (Kessler,

Berglund, et al., 2005; Kessler, Chiu, et al., 2005; Kessler, Demler, et al., 2005).

       About 80% of the sample reported seeking treatment for their disorder, but with as much

as a 10-year gap after symptoms first appeared. Women were more likely than men to seek help

while whites were more likely than African and Hispanic Americans (Wang, Berglund, et al.,

2005; Wang, Lane, et al., 2005). Care was sought primarily from family doctors, nurses, and

other general practitioners (23%), followed by social workers and psychologists (16%),

psychiatrists (12%), counselors or spiritual advisers (8%), and complementary and alternative

medicine providers (CAMs; 7%).

       In terms of the quality of the care, the article states:



                                                 1-37
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


               Most of this treatment was inadequate, at least by the standards applied in

               the survey. The researchers defined minimum adequacy as a suitable

               medication at a suitable dose for two months, along with at least four visits

               to a physician; or else eight visits to any licensed mental health

               professional. By that definition, only 33% of people with a psychiatric

               disorder were treated adequately, and only 13% of those who saw general

               medical practitioners.

In comparison to the original study conducted from 1991-1992, the use of mental health services

has increased over 50% during this decade. This may be attributed to treatment becoming more

widespread and increased attempts to educate the public about mental illness. Stigma, discussed

in Section 1.3, has reduced over time, diagnosis is more effective, community outreach programs

have increased, and most importantly, general practitioners have been more willing to prescribe

psychoactive medications which themselves are more readily available now. The article

concludes, “Survey researchers also suggest that we need more outreach and voluntary

screening, more education about mental illness for the public and physicians, and more effort to

treat substance abuse and impulse control disorders.” We will explore several of these issues in

the remainder of this section, including the use of psychiatric drugs and deinstitutionalization,

managed health care, private psychotherapy, positive psychology and prevention science,

multicultural psychology, and prescription rights for psychologists.

       1.4.7.2. Use of psychiatric drugs and deinstitutionalization. Beginning in the 1950s,

psychiatric or psychotropic drugs were used for the treatment of mental illness and made an

immediate impact. Though drugs alone cannot cure mental illness, they can improve symptoms

and increase the effectiveness of treatments such as psychotherapy. Classes of psychiatric drugs

include anti-depressants used to treat depression and anxiety, mood-stabilizing medications to

treat bipolar disorder, anti-psychotic drugs to treat schizophrenia, and anti-anxiety drugs to treat

generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder

       Frank (2006) found that by 1996, psychotropic drugs were used in 77% of mental health

cases and spending on these drugs grew from $2.8 billion in 1987 to about $18 billion in 2001

(Coffey et al., 2000; Mark et al., 2005), representing over a sixfold increase. The largest classes

of psychotropic drugs are anti-psychotics and anti-depressants, followed closely by anti-anxiety

medications. Frank, Conti, and Goldman (2005) point out, “The expansion of insurance coverage

for prescription drugs, the introduction and diffusion of managed behavioral health care

techniques, and the conduct of the pharmaceutical industry in promoting their products all have

influenced how psychotropic drugs are used and how much is spent on them.” Is it possible then

that we are overprescribing these mediations? Davey (2014) provides ten reasons why this may

be so, including leading suffers from believing that recovery is in their hands but instead in the

hands of their doctors; increased risk of relapse; drug companies causing the “medicalization of

perfectly normal emotional processes, such as bereavement” to ensure their survival; side effects;

and a failure to change the way the person thinks or the socioeconomic environments that may be

the cause of the disorder. For more on this article, please see:

prescribing. He cites the approval of Prozac by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in

1987 as when the issue began and the overmedication/overdiagnosis of children with ADHD as a

more recent example.

       A result of the use of psychiatric drugs was deinstitutionalization, or the release of

patients from mental health facilities. This shifted resources from inpatient to outpatient care and

placed the spotlight back on the biological or somatogenic perspective. When people with

severe mental illness do need inpatient care, it is typically in the form of short-term

hospitalization.

       1.4.7.3. Managed health care. Managed health care is a term used to describe a type of

health insurance in which the insurance company determines the cost of services, possible

providers, and the number of visits a subscriber can have within a year. This is regulated through

contracts with providers and medical facilities. The plans pay the providers directly, so

subscribers do not have to pay out-of-pocket or complete claim forms, though most require co-

pays paid directly to the provider at the time of service. Exactly how much the plan costs

depends on how flexible the subscriber wants it to be; the more flexibility, the higher the cost.

Managed health care takes three forms:

       •   Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) – Typically only pay for care within the

           network. The subscriber chooses a primary care physician (PCP) who coordinates the

           majority of their care. The PCP refers the subscriber to specialists or other health care

           providers as is necessary. This is the most restrictive option.

       •   Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO) - Usually pay more if the subscriber obtains

           care within the network, but if care outside the network is sought, they cover part of

           the cost.

                                                1-40
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


        •   Point of Service (POS) – These plans provide the most flexibility and allow the

            subscriber to choose between an HMO or a PPO each time care is needed.

        Regarding the treatment needed for mental illness, managed care programs regulate the

pre-approval of treatment via referrals from the PCP, determine which mental health providers

can be seen, and oversee which conditions can be treated and what type of treatment can be

delivered. This system was developed in the 1980s to combat the rising cost of mental health

care and took responsibility away from single practitioners or small groups who could charge

what they felt was appropriate. The actual impact of managed care on mental health services is

still questionable at best.

        1.4.7.4. Multicultural psychology. As our society becomes increasingly diverse, medical

practitioners and psychologists alike have to take into account the patient’s gender, age, race,

ethnicity, socioeconomic (SES) status, and culture and how these factors shape the individual’s

thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Additionally, we need to understand how the various groups,

whether defined by race, culture, or gender, differ from one another. This approach is called

multicultural psychology.

        In August 2002, the American Psychological Association’s (APA) Council of

Representatives put forth six guidelines based on the understanding that “race and ethnicity can

impact psychological practice and interventions at all levels” and the need for respect and

inclusiveness. They further state, “psychologists are in a position to provide leadership as agents

of prosocial change, advocacy, and social justice, thereby promoting societal understanding,

affirmation, and appreciation of multiculturalism against the damaging effects of individual,

institutional, and societal racism, prejudice, and all forms of oppression based on stereotyping

and discrimination.” The guidelines from the 2002 document are as follows:

                                               1-41
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


       •   “Guideline #1: Psychologists are encouraged to recognize that, as cultural beings,

           they may hold attitudes and beliefs that can detrimentally influence their perceptions

           of and interactions with individuals who are ethnically and racially different from

           themselves.

       •   Guideline #2: Psychologists are encouraged to recognize the importance of

           multicultural sensitivity/responsiveness, knowledge, and understanding about

           ethnically and racially different individuals.

       •   Guideline #3: As educators, psychologists are encouraged to employ the constructs of

           multiculturalism and diversity in psychological education.

       •   Guideline #4: Culturally sensitive psychological researchers are encouraged to

           recognize the importance of conducting culture–centered and ethical psychological

           research among persons from ethnic, linguistic, and racial minority backgrounds.

       •   Guideline #5: Psychologists strive to apply culturally-appropriate skills in clinical and

           other applied psychological practices.

       •   Guideline #6: Psychologists are encouraged to use organizational change processes to

           support culturally informed organizational (policy) development and practices.”

       This type of sensitivity training is vital because bias based on ethnicity, race, and culture

has been found in the diagnosis and treatment of autism (Harrison et al., 2017; Burkett, 2015),

borderline personality disorder (Jani et al., 2016), and schizophrenia (Neighbors et al., 2003;

Minsky et al., 2003). Despite these findings, Schwartz and Blankenship (2014) state, “It should

also be noted that although clear evidence supports a longstanding trend in differential diagnoses

                                               1-42
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


according to consumer race, this trend does not imply that one race (e.g., African Americans)

actually demonstrate more severe symptoms or higher prevalence rates of psychosis compared

with other races (e.g., Euro-Americans). Because clinicians are the diagnosticians and

misinterpretation, bias or other factors may play a role in this trend caution should be used when

making inferences about actual rates of psychosis among ethnic minority persons.” Additionally,

white middle-class help seekers were offered appointments with psychotherapists almost three

times as often as their black working-class counterparts. Women were offered an appointment

time in their preferred time range more than men were, though average appointment offer rates

were similar between genders (Kugelmass, 2016). These findings collectively show that though

we are becoming more culturally sensitive, we have a lot more work to do.

       1.4.7.5. Prescription rights for psychologists. To reduce inappropriate prescribing as

described in 1.4.7.2, it has been proposed to allow appropriately trained psychologists the right to

prescribe. Psychologists are more likely to utilize both therapy and medication, and so can make

the best choice for their patient. The right has already been granted in New Mexico, Louisiana,

Guam, the military, the Indian Health Services, and the U.S. Public Health Services. Measures in

other states “have been opposed by the American Medical Association and American Psychiatric

Association over concerns that inadequate training of psychologists could jeopardize patient

safety. Supporters of prescriptive authority for psychologists are quick to point out that there is

no evidence to support these concerns” (Smith, 2012).

       1.4.7.6. Prevention science. As a society, we used to wait for a mental or physical health

issue to emerge, then scramble to treat it. More recently, medicine and science has taken a

prevention stance, identifying the factors that cause specific mental health issues and

implementing interventions to stop them from happening, or at least minimize their deleterious

effects. Our focus has shifted from individuals to the population. Mental health promotion

programs have been instituted with success in schools (Shoshani & Steinmetz, 2014; Weare &

Nind, 2011; Berkowitz & Beer, 2007), in the workplace (Czabała, Charzyńska, & Mroziak, B.,

2011), with undergraduate and graduate students (Conley et al., 2017; Bettis et al., 2016), in

relation to bullying (Bradshaw, 2015), and with the elderly (Forsman et al., 2011). Many

researchers believe it is the ideal time to move from knowledge to action and to expand public

mental health initiatives (Wahlbeck, 2015). The growth of positive psychology in the late 1990s

has further propelled this movement forward. For more on positive psychology, please see

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   Some of the earliest views of mental illness saw it as the work of evil
       spirts, demons, gods, or witches who took control of the person, and in the
       Middle Ages it was seen as possession by the Devil and methods such as
       exorcism, flogging, prayer, the touching of relics, chanting, visiting holy
       sites, and holy water were used to rid the person of demonic influence.
   •   During the Renaissance, humanism was on the rise which emphasized
       human welfare and the uniqueness of the individual and led to an increase
       in the number of asylums as places of refuge for the mentally ill.
   •   The 18th to 19th centuries saw the rise of the moral treatment movement
       followed by the mental hygiene movement.
   •   The psychological or psychogenic perspective states that emotional or
       psychological factors are the cause of mental disorders and represented a
       challenge to the biological perspective which said that mental disorders
       were akin to physical disorders and had natural causes.
   •   Psychiatric or psychotropic drugs used to treat mental illness became
       popular beginning in the 1950s and led to deinstitutionalization or a shift
       from inpatient to outpatient care.


Section 1.4 Review Questions

   1. How has mental illness been viewed across time?
   2. Contrast the moral treatment and mental hygiene movements.
   3. Contrast the biological or somatogenic perspective with that of the
      psychological or psychogenic perspective.
   4. Discuss contemporary trends in relation to the use of drugs to treat mental
      illness, deinstitutionalization, managed health care, multicultural
      psychology, prescription rights for psychologists, and prevention science.

1.5.1. The Scientific Method

       Psychology is the “scientific study of behavior and mental processes.” We will spend

quite a lot of time on the behavior and mental processes part throughout this book and in relation

to mental disorders. Still, before we proceed, it is prudent to further elaborate on what makes

psychology scientific. It is safe to say that most people outside of our discipline or a sister

science would be surprised to learn that psychology utilizes the scientific method at all. That may

be even truer of clinical psychology, especially in light of the plethora of self-help books found

at any bookstore. But yes, the treatment methods used by mental health professionals are based

on empirical research and the scientific method.

        As a starting point, we should expand on what the scientific method is.



  The scientific method is a systematic method for gathering knowledge about the world
  around us.


The keyword here is systematic, meaning there is a set way to use it. What is that way? Well,

depending on what source you look at, it can include a varying number of steps. I like to use the

following:



Table 1.1: The Steps of the Scientific Method

 Step               Name                                     Description
   0         Ask questions and be    To study the world around us, you have to wonder about it.
              willing to wonder.     This inquisitive nature is the hallmark of critical thinking —
                                     our ability to assess claims made by others and make
                                     objective judgments that are independent of emotion and
                                     anecdote and based on hard evidence —and a requirement to

             problem to investigate. require further investigation to arrive at an answer. This
                                     investigation usually starts with a literature review, or when
                                     we conduct a literature search through our university library
                                     or a search engine such as Google Scholar to see what
                                     questions have been investigated already and what answers
                                     have been found, so that we can identify gaps or holes in this
                                     body of work.
   2         Attempt to explain the We now attempt to formulate an explanation of why the
             phenomena we wish to event occurs as it does. This systematic explanation of a
                     study.          phenomenon is a theory and our specific, testable prediction
                                     is the hypothesis. We will know if our theory is correct
                                     because we have formulated a hypothesis that we can now
                                     test.

   3          Test the hypothesis.    It goes without saying that if we cannot test our hypothesis,
                                      then we cannot show whether our prediction is correct or not.
                                      Our plan of action of how we will go about testing the
                                      hypothesis is called our research design. In the planning

                                   stage, we will select the appropriate research method to
                                   answer our question/test our hypothesis.
   4        Interpret the results. With our research study done, we now examine the data to
                                   see if the pattern we predicted exists. We need to see if a
                                   cause and effect statement can be made, assuming our
                                   method allows for this inference. More on this in Section 2.3.
                                   For now, it is essential to know that statistics have two
                                   forms. First, there are descriptive statistics which provide a
                                   means of summarizing or describing data and presenting the
                                   data in a usable form. You likely have heard of mean or
                                   average, median, and mode. Along with standard deviation
                                   and variance, these are ways to describe our data. Second,
                                   there are inferential statistics that allow for the analysis of
                                   two or more sets of numerical data to determine the
                                   statistical significance of the results. Significance is an
                                   indication of how confident we are that our results are due to
                                   our manipulation or design and not chance.
   5         Draw conclusions      We need to interpret our results accurately and not overstate
                 carefully.        our findings. To do this, we need to be aware of our biases
                                   and avoid emotional reasoning so that they do not cloud our
                                   judgment. How so? In our effort to stop a child from
                                   engaging in self-injurious behavior that could cause
                                   substantial harm or even death, we might overstate the
                                   success of our treatment method.
   6         Communicate our       Once we have decided on whether our hypothesis was
          findings to the broader correct or not, we need to share this information with others
           scientific community. so that they might comment critically on our methodology,
                                   statistical analyses, and conclusions. Sharing also allows for
                                   replication or repeating the study to confirm its results.
                                   Communication occurs via scientific journals, conferences,
                                   or newsletters released by many of the organizations
                                   mentioned in Module 1.6.



       Science has at its root three cardinal features that we will see play out time and time

again throughout this book. They are:

   1. Observation – To know about the world around us, we have to be able to see it firsthand.

       When a mental disorder afflicts an individual, we can see it through their overt behavior.

       An individual with depression may withdraw from activities he/she enjoys, those with


                                               1-48
                                                                 2nd edition as of August 2020


   social anxiety disorder will avoid social situations, people with schizophrenia may

   express concern over being watched by the government, and individuals with dependent

   personality disorder may leave major decisions to trusted companions. In these examples

   and numerous others, the behaviors that lead us to a diagnosis of a specific disorder can

   easily be observed by the clinician, the patient, and/or family and friends.

2. Experimentation – To be able to make causal or cause and effect statements, we must

   isolate variables. We have to manipulate one variable and see the effect of doing so on

   another variable. Let’s say we want to know if a new treatment for bipolar disorder is as

   effective as existing treatments, or more importantly, better. We could design a study

   with three groups of bipolar patients. One group would receive no treatment and serve as

   a control group. A second group would receive an existing and proven treatment and

   would also be considered a control group. Finally, the third group would receive the new

   treatment and be the experimental group. What we are manipulating is what treatment the

   groups get – no treatment, the older treatment, and the newer treatment. The first two

   groups serve as controls since we already know what to expect from their results. There

   should be no change in bipolar disorder symptoms in the no-treatment group, a general

   reduction in symptoms for the older treatment group, and the same or better performance

   for the newer treatment group. As long as patients in the newer treatment group do not

   perform worse than their older treatment counterparts, we can say the new drug is a

   success. You might wonder why we would get excited about the performance of the new

   drug being the same as the old drug. Does it really offer any added benefit? In terms of a

   reduction of symptoms, maybe not, but it could cost less money than the older drug and

   that would be of value to patients.

   3. Measurement – How do we know that the new drug has worked? Simply, we can

       measure the person’s bipolar disorder symptoms before any treatment was implemented,

       and then again once the treatment has run its course. This pre-post test design is typical

       in drug studies.



1.5.2. Research Methods

       Step 3 called on the scientist to test his or her hypothesis. Psychology as a discipline uses

five main research designs. They are:

       1.5.2.1. Naturalistic and laboratory observation. In terms of naturalistic observation,

the scientist studies human or animal behavior in its natural environment, which could include

the home, school, or a forest. The researcher counts, measures, and rates behavior in a systematic

way and, at times, uses multiple judges to ensure accuracy in how the behavior is being

measured. The advantage of this method is that you see behavior as it happens, and the

experimenter does not taint the data. The disadvantage is that it could take a long time for the

behavior to occur, and if the researcher is detected, then this may influence the behavior of those

being observed.

       Laboratory observation involves observing people or animals in a laboratory setting.

The researcher might want to know more about parent-child interactions, and so, brings a mother

and her child into the lab to engage in preplanned tasks such as playing with toys, eating a meal,

or the mother leaving the room for a short time. The advantage of this method over the

naturalistic method is that the experimenter can use sophisticated equipment to record the session

and examine it later. The problem is that since the subjects know the experimenter is watching



                                               1-50
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


them, their behavior could become artificial. Clinical observation is a commonly employed

research method to study psychopathology; we will talk about it more throughout this course.

       1.5.2.2. Case studies. Psychology can also utilize a detailed description of one person or

a small group based on careful observation. This was the approach the founder of

psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, took to develop his theories. The advantage of this method is

that you arrive at a detailed description of the investigated behavior, but the disadvantage is that

the findings may be unrepresentative of the larger population, and thus, lacking generalizability.

Again, bear in mind that you are studying one person or a tiny group. Can you possibly make

conclusions about all people from just one person, or even five or ten? The other issue is that the

case study is subject to researcher bias in terms of what is included in the final narrative and

what is left out. Despite these limitations, case studies can lead us to novel ideas about the cause

of abnormal behavior and help us to study unusual conditions that occur too infrequently to

analyze with large sample sizes and in a systematic way.

       1.5.2.3. Surveys/Self-Report data. This is a questionnaire consisting of at least one scale

with some questions used to assess a psychological construct of interest such as parenting style,

depression, locus of control, or sensation-seeking behavior. It may be administered by paper and

pencil or computer. Surveys allow for the collection of large amounts of data quickly, but the

actual survey could be tedious for the participant and social desirability, when a participant

answers questions dishonestly so that he/she is seen in a more favorable light, could be an issue.

For instance, if you are asking high school students about their sexual activity, they may not give

genuine answers for fear that their parents will find out. You could alternatively gather this

information via an interview in a structured or unstructured fashion.



                                                1-51
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


        1.5.2.4. Correlational research. This research method examines the relationship

between two variables or two groups of variables. A numerical measure of the strength of this

relationship is derived, called the correlation coefficient. It can range from -1.00, a perfect

inverse relationship in which one variable goes up as the other goes down, to 0 indicating no

relationship at all, to +1.00 or a perfect relationship in which as one variable goes up or down so

does the other. In terms of a negative correlation we might say that as a parent becomes more

rigid, controlling, and cold, the attachment of the child to parent goes down. In contrast, as a

parent becomes warmer, more loving, and provides structure, the child becomes more attached.

The advantage of correlational research is that you can correlate anything. The disadvantage is

that you can correlate anything, including variables that do not have any relationship with one

another. Yes, this is both an advantage and a disadvantage. For instance, we might correlate

instances of making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with someone we are attracted to sitting

near us at lunch. Are the two related? Not likely, unless you make a really good PB&J, but then

the person is probably only interested in you for food and not companionship. The main issue

here is that correlation does not allow you to make a causal statement.

        A special form of correlational research is the epidemiological study in which the

prevalence and incidence of a disorder in a specific population are measured (See Section 1.2 for

definitions).

        1.5.2.5. Experiments. This is a controlled test of a hypothesis in which a researcher

manipulates one variable and measures its effect on another variable. The manipulated variable is

called the independent variable (IV), and the one that is measured is called the dependent

variable (DV). In the example under Experimentation in Section 1.5.1, the treatment for bipolar

disorder was the IV, while the actual intensity or number of symptoms serve as the DV. A

                                                1-52
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


common feature of experiments is a control group that does not receive the treatment or is not

manipulated and an experimental group that does receive the treatment or manipulation. If the

experiment includes random assignment, participants have an equal chance of being placed in

the control or experimental group. The control group allows the researcher (or teacher) to make a

comparison to the experimental group and make a causal statement possible, and stronger. In our

experiment, the new treatment should show a marked reduction in the intensity of bipolar

symptoms compared to the group receiving no treatment, and perform either at the same level as,

or better than, the older treatment. This would be the initial hypothesis made before starting the

experiment.

       In a drug study, to ensure the participants' expectations do not affect the final results by

giving the researcher what he/she is looking for (in our example, symptoms improve whether the

participant is receiving treatment or not), we might use what is called a placebo, or a sugar pill

made to look exactly like the pill given to the experimental group. This way, participants all are

given something, but cannot figure out what exactly it is. You might say this keeps them honest

and allows the results to speak for themselves.

       Finally, the study of mental illness does not always afford us a large sample of

participants to study, so we have to focus on one individual using a single-subject experimental

design. This differs from a case study in the sheer number of strategies available to reduce

potential confounding variables, or variables not originally part of the research design but

contribute to the results in a meaningful way. One type of single-subject experimental design is

the reversal or ABAB design. Kuttler, Myles, and Carson (1998) used social stories to reduce

tantrum behavior in two social environments in a 12-year old student diagnosed with autism,

Fragile-X syndrome, and intermittent explosive disorder. Using an ABAB design, they found

                                                  1-53
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


that precursors to tantrum behavior decreased when the social stories were available (B) and

increased when the intervention was withdrawn (A). A more recent study (Balakrishnan & Alias,

20174) also established the utility of social stories as a social learning tool for children with

autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using an ABAB design. During the baseline phase (A), the four

student participants were observed, and data recorded on an observation form. During the

treatment phase (B), they listened to the social story and data was recorded in the same manner.

Upon completion of the first B, the students returned to A, which was followed one more time by

B and the reading of the social story. Once the second treatment phase ended, the participation

was monitored again to obtain the outcome. All students showed improvement during the

treatment phases in terms of the number of positive peer interactions, but the number of

interactions reduced in the absence of social stories. From this, the researchers concluded that the

social story led to the increase in positive peer interactions of children with ASD.

       1.5.2.6. Multi-method research. As you have seen above, no single method alone is

perfect. All have strengths and limitations. As such, for the psychologist to provide the most

precise picture of what is affecting behavior or mental processes, several of these approaches are

typically employed at different stages of the research study. This is called multi-method

research.

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   The scientific method is a systematic method for gathering knowledge about
       the world around us.
   •   A systematic explanation of a phenomenon is a theory and our specific,
       testable prediction is the hypothesis.
   •   Replication is when we repeat the study to confirm its results.
   •   Psychology’s five main research designs are observation, case studies,
       surveys, correlation, and experimentation.
   •   No single research method alone is perfect - all have strengths and
       limitations.

       One of the functions of science is to communicate findings. Testing hypotheses,

developing sound methodology, accurately analyzing data, and drawing sound conclusions are

important, but you must tell others what you have done too. This is accomplished by joining

professional societies and submitting articles to peer-reviewed journals. Below are some of the

organizations and journals relevant to applied behavior analysis.

Module Recap

       In Module 1, we undertook a relatively lengthy discussion of what abnormal behavior is

by first looking at what normal behavior is. What emerged was a general set of guidelines

focused on mental illness as causing dysfunction, distress, deviance, and at times, being

dangerous for the afflicted and others around him/her. Then we classified mental disorders in

terms of their occurrence, cause, course, prognosis, and treatment. We acknowledged that mental

illness is stigmatized in our society and provided a basis for why this occurs and what to do

about it. This involved a discussion of the history of mental illness and current views and trends.

       Psychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes. The word scientific

is key as psychology adheres to the strictest aspects of the scientific method and uses five main

research designs in its investigation of mental disorders – observation, case study, surveys,

correlational research, and experiments. Various mental health professionals use these designs,

and societies and journals provide additional means to communicate findings or to be good

consumers of psychological inquiry.

       It is with this foundation in mind that we move to examine models of abnormality in

Module 2.

                 Module 2: Models of Abnormal Psychology


Module Overview

       In Module 2, we will discuss three models of abnormal behavior to include the biological,

psychological, and sociocultural models. Each is unique in its own right and no single model can

account for all aspects of abnormality. Hence, we advocate for a multi-dimensional and not a

uni-dimensional model.

                2.1. Uni- vs. Multi-Dimensional Models of Abnormality



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Define the uni-dimensional model.

       •   Explain the need for a multi-dimensional model of abnormality.

       •   Define model.

       •   List and describe the models of abnormality.



2.1.1. Uni-Dimensional

       To effectively treat a mental disorder, we have to understand its cause. This could be a

single factor such as a chemical imbalance in the brain, relationship with a parent,

socioeconomic status (SES), a fearful event encountered during middle childhood, or the way in

which the individual copes with life’s stressors. This single factor explanation is called a uni-

dimensional model. The problem with this approach is that mental disorders are not typically

caused by a solitary factor, but multiple causes. Admittedly, single factors do emerge during a

person’s life, but as they arise, the factors become part of the individual. In time, the cause of the

person’s psychopathology is due to all of these individual factors.



2.1.2. Multi-Dimensional

       So, it is better to subscribe to a multi-dimensional model that integrates multiple causes

of psychopathology and affirms that each cause comes to affect other causes over time. Uni-

dimensional models alone are too simplistic to explain the etiology of mental disorders fully.

       Before introducing the current main models, it is crucial to understand what a model is.

In a general sense, a model is defined as a representation or imitation of an object

(dictionary.com). For mental health professionals, models help us to understand mental illness

since diseases such as depression cannot be touched or experienced firsthand. To be considered

distinct from other conditions, a mental illness must have its own set of symptoms. But as you

will see, the individual does not have to present with the entire range of symptoms. For example,

five out of nine symptoms may be enough to be diagnosed as having dysthymia, paranoid

schizophrenia, avoidant personality disorder, or illness anxiety disorder. There will be some

variability in terms of what symptoms are displayed, but in general, all people with a specific

psychopathology have symptoms from that group.

       We can also ask the patient probing questions, seek information from family members,

examine medical records, and in time, organize and process all of this information to better

understand the person’s condition and potential causes. Models aid us with doing all of this. Still,

we must remember that the model is a starting point for the researcher, and due to this, it

determines what causes might be investigated at the exclusion of other causes. Often, proponents

of a given model find themselves in disagreement with proponents of other models. All forget

that there is no individual model that completely explains human behavior, or in this case,

abnormal behavior, and so each model contributes in its own way. Here are the models we will

examine in this module:

       •   Biological – includes genetics, chemical imbalances in the brain, the functioning of

           the nervous system, etc.

       •   Psychological – includes learning, personality, stress, cognition, self-efficacy, and

           early life experiences. We will examine several perspectives that make up the

                                                2-4

    psychological model to include psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive, and

    humanistic-existential.

•   Sociocultural – includes factors such as one’s gender, religious orientation, race,

    ethnicity, and culture.




You should have learned the following in this section:
    •   The uni-dimensional model proposes a single factor as the cause of
        psychopathology while the multi-dimensional model integrates multiple
        causes of psychopathology and affirms that each cause comes to affect other
        causes over time.
    •   There is no individual model that completely explains human behavior and so
        each model contributes in its own way.


Section 2.1 Review Questions

    1. What is the problem with a uni-dimensional model of psychopathology?
    2. Discuss the concept of a model and identify those important to understanding
       psychopathology.

                                  2.2. The Biological Model



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe how communication in the nervous system occurs.

       •   List the parts of the nervous system.

       •   Describe the structure of the neuron and all key parts.

       •   Outline how neural transmission occurs.

       •   Identify and define important neurotransmitters.

       •   List the major structures of the brain.

       •   Clarify how specific areas of the brain are involved in mental illness.

       •   Describe the role of genes in mental illness.

       •   Describe the role of hormonal imbalances in mental illness.

       •   Describe the role of viral infections in mental illness.

       •   Describe commonly used treatments for mental illness.

       •   Evaluate the usefulness of the biological model.



       Proponents of the biological model view mental illness as being a result of a malfunction

in the body to include issues with brain anatomy or chemistry. As such, we will need to establish

a foundation for how communication in the nervous system occurs, what the parts of the nervous

system are, what a neuron is and its structure, how neural transmission occurs, and what the parts

of the brain are. All while doing this, we will identify areas of concern for psychologists focused

on the treatment of mental disorders.

2.2.1. Brain Structure and Chemistry

       2.2.1.1. Communication in the nervous system. To truly understand brain structure and

chemistry, it is a good idea to understand how communication occurs within the nervous system.

See Figure 2.1 below. Simply:

       1. Receptor cells in each of the five sensory systems detect energy.

       2. This information is passed to the nervous system due to the process of transduction

          and through sensory or afferent neurons, which are part of the peripheral nervous

          system.

       3. The information is received by brain structures (central nervous system) and

          perception occurs.

       4. Once the information has been interpreted, commands are sent out, telling the body

          how to respond (Step E), also via the peripheral nervous system.

Figure 2.1. Communication in the Nervous System




        Please note that we will not cover this process in full, but just the parts relevant to our

topic of psychopathology.

        2.2.1.2. The nervous system. The nervous system consists of two main parts – the

central and peripheral nervous systems. The central nervous system (CNS) is the control center

for the nervous system, which receives, processes, interprets, and stores incoming sensory

information. It consists of the brain and spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system consists of

everything outside the brain and spinal cord. It handles the CNS’s input and output and divides

into the somatic and autonomic nervous systems. The somatic nervous system allows for

voluntary movement by controlling the skeletal muscles and carries sensory information to the

CNS. The autonomic nervous system regulates the functioning of blood vessels, glands, and

internal organs such as the bladder, stomach, and heart. It consists of sympathetic and

parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is involved when a person

is intensely aroused. It provides the strength to fight back or to flee (fight-or-flight instinct).

Eventually, the response brought about by the sympathetic nervous system must end. The

parasympathetic nervous system calms the body.



Figure 2.2. The Structure of the Nervous System




       2.2.1.3. The neuron. The fundamental unit of the nervous system is the neuron, or nerve

cell (See Figure 2.3). It has several structures in common with all cells in the body. The nucleus

is the control center of the body and the soma is the cell body. In terms of distinctive structures,

these focus on the ability of a neuron to send and receive information. The axon sends

signals/information to neighboring neurons while the dendrites, which resemble little trees,

receive information from neighboring neurons. Note the plural form of dendrite and the singular

form of axon; there are many dendrites but only one axon. Also of importance to the neuron is

the myelin sheath or the white, fatty covering which: 1) provides insulation so that signals from

adjacent neurons do not affect one another and, 2) increases the speed at which signals are

transmitted. The axon terminals are the end of the axon where the electrical impulse becomes a

chemical message and passes to an adjacent neuron.

       Though not neurons, glial cells play an important part in helping the nervous system to be

the efficient machine that it is. Glial cells are support cells in the nervous system that serve five

main functions:

       1. They act as a glue and hold the neuron in place.

       2. They form the myelin sheath.

       3. They provide nourishment for the cell.

       4. They remove waste products.

       5. They protect the neuron from harmful substances.



   Finally, nerves are a group of axons bundled together like wires in an electrical cable.

       2.2.1.4. Neural transmission. Transducers or receptor cells in the major organs of our

five sensory systems – vision (the eyes), hearing (the ears), smell (the nose), touch (the skin), and

taste (the tongue) – convert the physical energy that they detect or sense, and send it to the brain

via the neural impulse. How so? See Figure 2.4 below. We will cover this process in three parts.



Part 1. The Axon and Neural Impulse

The neural impulse follows the following steps:

       •   Step 1 – Neurons waiting to fire are said to be in resting potential and polarized, or

           having a negative charge inside the neuron and a positive charge outside.

       •   Step 2 – If adequately stimulated, the neuron experiences an action potential and

           becomes depolarized. When this occurs, voltage-gated ion channels open, allowing

           positively charged sodium ions (Na+) to enter. This shifts the polarity to positive on

           the inside and negative outside. Note that ions are charged particles found both inside

           and outside the neuron.

       •   Step 3 – Once the action potential passes from one segment of the axon to the next,

           the previous segment begins to repolarize. This occurs because the Na channels close

           and potassium (K) channels open. K+ has a positive charge, so the neuron becomes

           negative again on the inside and positive on the outside.

       •   Step 4 – After the neuron fires, it will not fire again no matter how much stimulation

           it receives. This is called the absolute refractory period. Think of it as the neuron

           ABSOLUTELY will not fire, no matter what.

       •   Step 5 – After a short time, the neuron can fire again, but needs greater than normal

           levels of stimulation to do so. This is called the relative refractory period.

                                                2-11
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


       •   Step 6 - Please note that this process is cyclical. We started at resting potential in Step

           1 and end at resting potential in Step 6.



Part 2. The Action Potential

       Let's look at the electrical portion of the process in another way and add some detail.



Figure 2.4. The Action Potential




       •   Recall that a neuron is usually at resting potential and polarized. The charge inside is

           -70mV at rest.

       •   If it receives sufficient stimulation, causing the polarity inside the neuron to rise from

           -70 mV to -55mV (threshold of excitation), the neuron will fire or send an electrical

           impulse down the length of the axon (the action potential or depolarization). It should

           be noted that it either hits -55mV and fires, or it does not fire at all. This is the all-or-

           nothing principle. The threshold must be reached.

       •   Once the electrical impulse has passed from one segment of the axon to the next, the

           neuron begins the process of resetting called repolarization.

                                                 2-12
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


       •   During repolarization the neuron will not fire no matter how much stimulation it

           receives. This is called the absolute refractory period.

       •   The neuron next moves into a relative refractory period, meaning it can fire but needs

           higher than normal levels of stimulation. Notice how the line has dropped below -

           70mV. Hence, to reach -55mV and fire, it will need more than the normal gain of

           +15mV (-70 to -55 mV).

       •   And then we return to resting potential, as you saw in Figure 2.4



Part 3. The Synapse

       The electrical portion of the neural impulse is just the start. The actual code passes from

one neuron to another in a chemical form called a neurotransmitter. The point where this

occurs is called the synapse. The synapse consists of three parts – the axon of the sending

neuron, the space in between called the synaptic space, gap, or cleft, and the dendrite of the

receiving neuron. Once the electrical impulse reaches the end of the axon, called the axon

terminal, it stimulates synaptic vesicles or neurotransmitter sacs to release the neurotransmitter.

Neurotransmitters will only bind to their specific receptor sites, much like a key will only fit

into the lock it was designed for. You might say neurotransmitters are part of a lock-and-key

system. What happens to the neurotransmitters that do not bind to a receptor site? They might go

through reuptake, which is the process of the presynaptic neuron taking up excess

neurotransmitters in the synaptic space for future use or enzymatic degradation when enzymes

destroy excess neurotransmitters in the synaptic space.

       2.2.1.5. Neurotransmitters. What exactly are some of the neurotransmitters which are so

critical for neural transmission, and are essential to our discussion of psychopathology?

       •   Dopamine – controls voluntary movements and is associated with the reward

           mechanism in the brain

       •   Serotonin – regulates pain, sleep cycle, and digestion; leads to a stable mood, so low

           levels leads to depression

       •   Endorphins – involved in reducing pain and making the person calm and happy

       •   Norepinephrine – increases the heart rate and blood pressure and regulates mood

       •   GABA – blocks the signals of excitatory neurotransmitters responsible for anxiety

           and panic

       •   Glutamate – associated with learning and memory

       The critical thing to understand here is that there is a belief in the realm of mental health

that chemical imbalances are responsible for many mental disorders. Chief among these are

neurotransmitter imbalances. For instance, people with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) have

difficulty regulating serotonin. More on this throughout the book as we discuss each disorder.

       2.2.1.6. The brain. The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord; the

former we will discuss briefly and in terms of key structures which include:

       •   Medulla – regulates breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure

       •   Pons – acts as a bridge connecting the cerebellum and medulla and helps to transfer

           messages between different parts of the brain and spinal cord

       •   Reticular formation – responsible for alertness and attention

       •   Cerebellum – involved in our sense of balance and for coordinating the body’s

           muscles so that movement is smooth and precise. Involved in the learning of certain

           kinds of simple responses and acquired reflexes.

       •   Thalamus – the major sensory relay center for all senses except smell

                                               2-14

       •   Hypothalamus – involved in drives associated with the survival of both the

           individual and the species. It regulates temperature by triggering sweating or

           shivering and controls the complex operations of the autonomic nervous system

       •   Amygdala – responsible for evaluating sensory information and quickly determining

           its emotional importance

       •   Hippocampus – our “gateway” to memory. Allows us to form spatial memories so

           that we can accurately navigate through our environment and helps us to form new

           memories about facts and events

       •   The cerebrum has four distinct regions in each cerebral hemisphere. First, the

           frontal lobe contains the motor cortex, which issues orders to the muscles of the

           body that produce voluntary movement. The frontal lobe is also involved in emotion

           and in the ability to make plans, think creatively, and take initiative. The parietal

           lobe contains the somatosensory cortex and receives information about pressure, pain,

           touch, and temperature from sense receptors in the skin, muscles, joints, internal

           organs, and taste buds. The occipital lobe contains the visual cortex for receiving and

           processing visual information. Finally, the temporal lobe is involved in memory,

           perception, and emotion. It contains the auditory cortex which processes sound.

       Of course, this is not an exhaustive list of structures found in the brain but gives you a

pretty good idea of function and which structure is responsible for it. What is important to mental

health professionals is some disorders involve specific areas of the brain. For instance,

Parkinson’s disease is a brain disorder that results in a gradual loss of muscle control and arises

when cells in the substantia nigra, a long nucleus considered to be part of the basal ganglia,

stop making dopamine. As these cells die, the brain fails to receive messages about when and

                                                2-15
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


how to move. In the case of depression, low levels of serotonin are responsible, at least partially.

New evidence suggests “nerve cell connections, nerve cell growth, and the functioning of nerve

circuits have a major impact on depression… and areas that play a significant role in depression

are the amygdala, the thalamus, and the hippocampus.” Also, individuals with borderline

personality disorder have been shown to have structural and functional changes in brain areas

associated with impulse control and emotional regulation, while imaging studies reveal

differences in the frontal cortex and subcortical structures for those suffering from OCD.

2.2.2. Genes, Hormonal Imbalances, and Viral Infections

       2.2.2.1. Genetic issues and explanations. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is our heredity

material. It exists in the nucleus of each cell, packaged in threadlike structures known as

chromosomes, for which we have 23 pairs or 46 total. Twenty-two of the pairs are the same in

both sexes, but the 23rd pair is called the sex chromosome and differs between males and

females. Males have X and Y chromosomes while females have two Xs. According to the

Genetics Home Reference website as part of NIH’s National Library of Medicine, a gene is “the

basic physical and functional unit of heredity” (https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/basics/gene). They

act as the instructions to make proteins, and it is estimated by the Human Genome Project that

we have between 20,000 and 25,000 genes. We all have two copies of each gene, one inherited

from our mother and one from our father.

       Recent research has discovered that autism, ADHD, bipolar disorder, major depression,

and schizophrenia all share genetic roots. They “were more likely to have suspect genetic

variation at the same four chromosomal sites. These included risk versions of two genes that

regulate the flow of calcium into cells.” Likewise, twin and family studies have shown that

people with first-degree relatives suffering from OCD are at higher risk to develop the disorder

themselves. The same is true of borderline personality disorder.

       WebMD adds, “Experts believe many mental illnesses are linked to abnormalities in

many genes rather than just one or a few and that how these genes interact with the environment

is unique for every person (even identical twins). That is why a person inherits a susceptibility to

a mental illness and doesn't necessarily develop the illness. Mental illness itself occurs from the

interaction of multiple genes and other factors–such as stress, abuse, or a traumatic event–which

can influence, or trigger, an illness in a person who has an inherited susceptibility to it”

       2.2.2.2. Hormonal imbalances. The body has two coordinating and integrating systems,

the nervous system and the endocrine system. The main difference between these two systems is

the speed with which they act. The nervous system moves quickly with nerve impulses moving

in a few hundredths of a second. The endocrine system moves slowly with hormones, released

by endocrine glands, taking seconds, or even minutes, to reach their target. Hormones are

important to psychologists because they manage the nervous system and body tissues at certain

stages of development and activate behaviors such as alertness or sleepiness, sexual behavior,

concentration, aggressiveness, reaction to stress, and a desire for companionship. The pituitary

gland is the “master gland” which regulates other endocrine glands. It influences blood pressure,

thirst, contractions of the uterus during childbirth, milk production, sexual behavior and interest,

body growth, the amount of water in the body’s cells, and other functions as well. The pineal

gland helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle while the thyroid gland regulates the body’s energy

levels by controlling metabolism and the basal metabolic rate (BMR). It regulates the body’s rate

of metabolism and so how energetic people are.

       Of importance to mental health professionals are the adrenal glands, located on top of

the kidneys, and which release cortisol to help the body deal with stress. Elevated levels of this

hormone can lead to several problems, including increased weight gain, interference with

learning and memory, reduced bone density, high cholesterol, and an increased risk of

depression. Similarly, the overproduction of the hormone melatonin can lead to SAD.

       2.2.2.3. Viral infections. Infections can cause brain damage and lead to the development

of mental illness or exacerbate existing symptoms. For example, evidence suggests that

contracting strep infection can lead to the development of OCD, Tourette’s syndrome, and tic

disorder in children (Mell, Davis, & Owens, 2005; Giedd et al., 2000; Allen et al., 1995;

https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-perfectionists-handbook/201202/can-infections-

result-in-mental-illness). Influenza epidemics have also been linked to schizophrenia (Brown et

                                                2-18

al., 2004; McGrath and Castle, 1995; McGrath et al., 1994; O'callaghan et al., 1991) though

more recent research suggests this evidence is weak at best (Selten & Termorshuizen, 2017;

Ebert & Kotler, 2005).



2.2.3. Treatments

       2.2.3.1. Psychopharmacology and psychotropic drugs. One option to treat severe

mental illness is psychotropic medications. These medications fall under five major categories.

Antidepressants are used to treat depression, but also anxiety, insomnia, and pain. The most

common types of antidepressants are SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and include

Citalopram, Paroxetine, and Fluoxetine (Prozac). Possible side effects include weight gain,

sleepiness, nausea and vomiting, panic attacks, or thoughts about suicide or dying.

       Anti-anxiety medications help with the symptoms of anxiety and include benzodiazepines

such as Clonazepam, Alprazolam, and Lorazepam. “Anti-anxiety medications such as

benzodiazepines are effective in relieving anxiety and take effect more quickly than the

antidepressant medications (or buspirone) often prescribed for anxiety. However, people can

build up a tolerance to benzodiazepines if they are taken over a long period of time and may need

higher and higher doses to get the same effect.” Side effects include drowsiness, dizziness,

nausea, difficulty urinating, and irregular heartbeat, to name a few.

       Stimulants increase one’s alertness and attention and are frequently used to treat ADHD.

They include Lisdexamfetamine, the combination of dextroamphetamine and amphetamine, and

Methylphenidate. Stimulants are generally effective and produce a calming effect. Possible side

effects include loss of appetite, headache, motor or verbal tics, and personality changes such as

appearing emotionless.

       Antipsychotics are used to treat psychosis or “conditions that affect the mind, and in

which there has been some loss of contact with reality, often including delusions (false, fixed

beliefs) or hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not really there).” They can be used to

treat eating disorders, severe depression, PTSD, OCD, ADHD, and Generalized Anxiety

Disorder. Common antipsychotics include Chlorpromazine, Perphenazine, Quetiapine, and

Lurasidone. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, weight gain, restlessness,

tremors, and rigidity.

       Mood stabilizers are used to treat bipolar disorder and, at times, depression,

schizoaffective disorder, and disorders of impulse control. A common example is Lithium; side

effects include loss of coordination, hallucinations, seizures, and frequent urination.

       The use of these drugs has been generally beneficial to patients. Most report that their

symptoms decline, leading them to feel better and improve their functioning. Also, long-term

hospitalizations are less likely to occur as a result, though the medications do not benefit the

individual in terms of improved living skills.

       2.2.3.2. Electroconvulsive therapy. According to Mental Health America,

“Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a procedure in which a brief application of electric stimulus

is used to produce a generalized seizure.” Patients are placed on a padded bed and administered a

muscle relaxant to avoid injury during the seizures. Annually, approximately 100,000 undergo

ECT to treat conditions such as severe depression, acute mania, suicidality, and some forms of

schizophrenia. The procedure is still the most controversial available to mental health
                                               2-20

professionals due to “its effectiveness vs. the side effects, the objectivity of ECT experts, and the

recent increase in ECT as a quick and easy solution, instead of long-term psychotherapy or

hospitalization” (http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/ect). Its popularity has declined since the

1960s and 1970s.

       2.2.3.3. Psychosurgery. Another option to treat mental disorders is to perform brain

surgeries. In the past, we have conducted trephination and lobotomies, neither of which are used

today. Today’s techniques are much more sophisticated and have been used to treat

schizophrenia, depression, and some personality and anxiety disorders. However, critics cite

obvious ethical issues with conducting such surgeries as well as scientific issues.

2.2.4. Evaluation of the Model

       The biological model is generally well respected today but suffers a few key issues. First,

consider the list of side effects given for psychotropic medications. You might make the case that

some of the side effects are worse than the condition they are treating. Second, the viewpoint that

all human behavior is explainable in biological terms, and therefore when issues arise, they can

be treated using biological methods, overlooks factors that are not fundamentally biological.

More on that over the next two sections.




     You should have learned the following in this section:
         •   Proponents of the biological model view mental illness as being a result of a
             malfunction in the body to include issues with brain anatomy or chemistry.
         •   Neurotransmitter imbalances and problems with brain structures/areas can
             result in mental disorders.
         •   Many disorders have genetic roots, are a result of hormonal imbalances, or
             caused by viral infections such as strep.
         •   Treatments related to the biological model include drugs, ECT, and
             psychosurgery.

2.3.1. Psychodynamic Theory

       In 1895, the book, Studies on Hysteria, was published by Josef Breuer (1842-1925) and

Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), and marked the birth of psychoanalysis, though Freud did not use

this actual term until a year later. The book published several case studies, including that of Anna

O., born February 27, 1859 in Vienna to Jewish parents Siegmund and Recha Pappenheim, strict

Orthodox adherents who were considered millionaires at the time. Bertha, known in published

case studies as Anna O., was expected to complete the formal education typical of upper-middle-

class girls, which included foreign language, religion, horseback riding, needlepoint, and piano.

She felt confined and suffocated in this life and took to a fantasy world she called her “private

theater.” Anna also developed hysteria, including symptoms such as memory loss, paralysis,

disturbed eye movements, reduced speech, nausea, and mental deterioration. Her symptoms

appeared as she cared for her dying father, and her mother called on Breuer to diagnosis her

condition (note that Freud never actually treated her). Hypnosis was used at first and relieved her

symptoms, as it had done for many patients (See Module 1). Breuer made daily visits and

allowed her to share stories from her private theater, which she came to call “talking cure” or

“chimney sweeping.” Many of the stories she shared were actually thoughts or events she found

troubling and reliving them helped to relieve or eliminate the symptoms. Breuer’s wife,

Mathilde, became jealous of her husband’s relationship with the young girl, leading Breuer to

terminate treatment in June of 1882 before Anna had fully recovered. She relapsed and was

admitted to Bellevue Sanatorium on July 1, eventually being released in October of the same

year. With time, Anna O. did recover from her hysteria and went on to become a prominent

member of the Jewish Community, involving herself in social work, volunteering at soup

kitchens, and becoming ‘House Mother’ at an orphanage for Jewish girls in 1895. Bertha (Anna

O.) became involved in the German Feminist movement, and in 1904 founded the League of

Jewish Women. She published many short stories; a play called Women’s Rights, in which she

criticized the economic and sexual exploitation of women; and wrote a book in 1900 called The

Jewish Problem in Galicia, in which she blamed the poverty of the Jews of Eastern Europe on

their lack of education. In 1935, Bertha was diagnosed with a tumor, and in 1936, she was

summoned by the Gestapo to explain anti-Hitler statements she had allegedly made. She died

shortly after this interrogation on May 28, 1936. Freud considered the talking cure of Anna O. to

be the origin of psychoanalytic therapy and what would come to be called the cathartic method.

       2.3.1.1. The structure of personality. Freud’s psychoanalysis was unique in the history

of psychology because it did not arise within universities as most major schools of thought did;

rather, it emerged from medicine and psychiatry to address psychopathology and examine the

unconscious. Freud believed that consciousness had three levels – 1) consciousness which was

the seat of our awareness, 2) preconscious that included all of our sensations, thoughts,

memories, and feelings, and 3) the unconscious, which was not available to us. The contents of

the unconscious could move from the unconscious to preconscious, but to do so, it had to pass a

Gate Keeper. Content that was turned away was said to be repressed.

       According to Freud, our personality has three parts – the id, superego, and ego, and from

these our behavior arises. First, the id is the impulsive part that expresses our sexual and

aggressive instincts. It is present at birth, completely unconscious, and operates on the pleasure

                                                2-25
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


principle, resulting in selfishly seeking immediate gratification of our needs no matter what the

cost. The second part of personality emerges after birth with early formative experiences and is

called the ego. The ego attempts to mediate the desires of the id against the demands of reality,

and eventually, the moral limitations or guidelines of the superego. It operates on the reality

principle, or an awareness of the need to adjust behavior, to meet the demands of our

environment. The last part of the personality to develop is the superego, which represents

society’s expectations, moral standards, rules, and represents our conscience. It leads us to adopt

our parent’s values as we come to realize that many of the id’s impulses are unacceptable. Still,

we violate these values at times and experience feelings of guilt. The superego is partly

conscious but mostly unconscious, and part of it becomes our conscience. The three parts of

personality generally work together well and compromise, leading to a healthy personality, but if

the conflict is not resolved, intrapsychic conflicts can arise and lead to mental disorders.

       Personality develops over five distinct stages in which the libido focuses on different

parts of the body. First, libido is the psychic energy that drives a person to pleasurable thoughts

and behaviors. Our life instincts, or Eros, are manifested through it and are the creative forces

that sustain life. They include hunger, thirst, self-preservation, and sex. In contrast, Thanatos,

our death instinct, is either directed inward as in the case of suicide and masochism or outward

via hatred and aggression. Both types of instincts are sources of stimulation in the body and

create a state of tension that is unpleasant, thereby motivating us to reduce them. Consider

hunger, and the associated rumbling of our stomach, fatigue, lack of energy, etc., that motivates

us to find and eat food. If we are angry at someone, we may engage in physical or relational

aggression to alleviate this stimulation.

       2.3.1.2. The development of personality. Freud’s psychosexual stages of personality

development are listed below. Please note that a person may become fixated at any stage,

meaning they become stuck, thereby affecting later development and possibly leading to

abnormal functioning, or psychopathology.

       1. Oral Stage – Beginning at birth and lasting to 24 months, the libido is focused on the

           mouth. Sexual tension is relieved by sucking and swallowing at first, and then later by

           chewing and biting as baby teeth come in. Fixation is linked to a lack of confidence,

           argumentativeness, and sarcasm.

       2. Anal Stage – Lasting from 2-3 years, the libido is focused on the anus as toilet

           training occurs. If parents are too lenient, children may become messy or

           unorganized. If parents are too strict, children may become obstinate, stingy, or

           orderly.

       3. Phallic Stage – Occurring from about age 3 to 5-6 years, the libido is focused on the

           genitals, and children develop an attachment to the parent of the opposite sex and are

           jealous of the same-sex parent. The Oedipus complex develops in boys and results in

           the son falling in love with his mother while fearing that his father will find out and

           castrate him. Meanwhile, girls fall in love with the father and fear that their mother

           will find out, called the Electra complex. A fixation at this stage may result in low

           self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness, and shyness.

       4. Latency Stage – From 6-12 years of age, children lose interest in sexual behavior, so

           boys play with boys and girls with girls. Neither sex pays much attention to the

           opposite sex.



                                               2-27

       5. Genital Stage – Beginning at puberty, sexual impulses reawaken and unfulfilled

             desires from infancy and childhood can be satisfied during lovemaking.



       2.3.1.3. Dealing with anxiety. The ego has a challenging job to fulfill, balancing both the

will of the id and the superego, and the overwhelming anxiety and panic this creates. Ego-

defense mechanisms are in place to protect us from this pain but are considered maladaptive if

they are misused and become our primary way of dealing with stress. They protect us from

anxiety and operate unconsciously by distorting reality. Defense mechanisms include the

following:

       •     Repression – When unacceptable ideas, wishes, desires, or memories are blocked

             from consciousness such as forgetting a horrific car accident that you caused.

             Eventually, though, it must be dealt with or the repressed memory can cause

             problems later in life.

       •     Reaction formation – When an impulse is repressed and then expressed by its

             opposite. For example, you are angry with your boss but cannot lash out at him, so

             you are super friendly instead. Another example is having lustful thoughts about a

             coworker than you cannot express because you are married, so you are extremely

             hateful to this person.

       •     Displacement – When we satisfy an impulse with a different object because focusing

             on the primary object may get us in trouble. A classic example is taking out your

             frustration with your boss on your wife and/or kids when you get home. If you lash

             out at your boss, you could be fired. The substitute target is less dangerous than the

             primary target.

•    Projection – When we attribute threatening desires or unacceptable motives to

     others. An example is when we do not have the skills necessary to complete a task,

     but we blame the other members of our group for being incompetent and unreliable.

•    Sublimation – When we find a socially acceptable way to express a desire. If we are

     stressed out or upset, we may go to the gym and box or lift weights. A person who

     desires to cut things may become a surgeon.

•    Denial – Sometimes, life is so hard that all we can do is deny how bad it is. An

     example is denying a diagnosis of lung cancer given by your doctor.

•    Identification – When we find someone who has found a socially acceptable way to

     satisfy their unconscious wishes and desires, and we model that behavior.

•    Regression – When we move from a mature behavior to one that is infantile. If your

     significant other is nagging you, you might regress by putting your hands over your

     ears and saying, “La la la la la la la la…”

•    Rationalization – When we offer well-thought-out reasons for why we did what we

     did, but these are not the real reason. Students sometimes rationalize not doing well in

     a class by stating that they really are not interested in the subject or saying the

     instructor writes impossible-to-pass tests.

•    Intellectualization – When we avoid emotion by focusing on the intellectual aspects

     of a situation such as ignoring the sadness we are feeling after the death of our mother

     by focusing on planning the funeral.

       2.3.1.4. Psychodynamic techniques. Freud used three primary assessment techniques—

free association, transference, and dream analysis—as part of psychoanalysis, or psychoanalytic

therapy, to understand the personalities of his patients and expose repressed material. First, free

association involves the patient describing whatever comes to mind during the session. The

patient continues but always reaches a point when he/she cannot or will not proceed any further.

The patient might change the subject, stop talking, or lose his/her train of thought. Freud said this

resistance revealed where issues persisted.

       Second, transference is the process through which patients transfer attitudes he/she held

during childhood to the therapist. They may be positive and include friendly, affectionate

feelings, or negative, and include hostile and angry feelings. The goal of therapy is to wean

patients from their childlike dependency on the therapist.

       Finally, Freud used dream analysis to understand a person’s innermost wishes. The

content of dreams includes the person’s actual retelling of the dreams, called manifest content,

and the hidden or symbolic meaning called latent content. In terms of the latter, some symbols

are linked to the person specifically, while others are common to all people.

     2.3.1.5. Evaluating psychodynamic theory. Freud’s psychodynamic theory made a lasting

impact on the field of psychology but also has been criticized heavily. First, Freud made most of

his observations in an unsystematic, uncontrolled way, and he relied on the case study method.

Second, the participants in his studies were not representative of the broader population. Despite

Freud's generalization, his theory was based on only a few patients. Third, he relied solely on

the reports of his patients and sought no observer reports. Fourth, it is difficult to empirically

study psychodynamic principles since most operate unconsciously. This begs the question of

                                                 2-30

how we can really know that they exist. Finally, psychoanalytic treatment is expensive and time

consuming, and since Freud’s time, drug therapies have become more popular and successful.

Still, Sigmund Freud developed useful therapeutic tools for clinicians and raised awareness about

the role the unconscious plays in both normal and abnormal behavior.



2.3.2. The Behavioral Model

       2.3.2.1. What is learning? The behavioral model concerns the cognitive process of

learning, which is any relatively permanent change in behavior due to experience and practice.

Learning has two main forms – associative learning and observational learning. First, associative

learning is the linking together of information sensed from our environment. Conditioning, or a

type of associative learning, occurs when two separate events become connected. There are two

forms: classical conditioning, or linking together two types of stimuli, and operant conditioning,

or linking together a response with its consequence. Second, observational learning occurs

when we learn by observing the world around us.

       We should also note the existence of non-associative learning or when there is no linking

of information or observing the actions of others around you. Types include habituation, or

when we simply stop responding to repetitive and harmless stimuli in our environment such as a

fan running in your laptop as you work on a paper, and sensitization, or when our reactions are

increased due to a strong stimulus, such as an individual who experienced a mugging and now

panics when someone walks up behind him/her on the street.

       Behaviorism is the school of thought associated with learning that began in 1913 with the

publication of John B. Watson’s article, “Psychology as the Behaviorist Views It,” in the journal

Psychological Review (Watson, 1913). Watson believed that the subject matter of psychology

was to be observable behavior, and to that end, psychology should focus on the prediction and

control of behavior. Behaviorism was dominant from 1913 to 1990 before being absorbed into

mainstream psychology. It went through three major stages – behaviorism proper under Watson

and lasting from 1913-1930 (discussed as classical/respondent conditioning), neobehaviorism

under Skinner and lasting from 1930-1960 (discussed as operant conditioning), and

sociobehaviorism under Bandura and Rotter and lasting from 1960-1990 (discussed as social

learning theory).

       2.3.2.2. Respondent conditioning. You have likely heard about Pavlov and his dogs, but

what you may not know is that this was a discovery made accidentally. Ivan Petrovich Pavlov

(1906, 1927, 1928), a Russian physiologist, was interested in studying digestive processes in

dogs in response to being fed meat powder. What he discovered was the dogs would salivate

even before the meat powder was presented. They would salivate at the sound of a bell, footsteps

in the hall, a tuning fork, or the presence of a lab assistant. Pavlov realized some stimuli

automatically elicited responses (such as salivating to meat powder) and other stimuli had to be

paired with these automatic associations for the animal or person to respond to it (such as

salivating to a bell). Armed with this stunning revelation, Pavlov spent the rest of his career

investigating the learning phenomenon.

       The important thing to understand is that not all behaviors occur due to reinforcement and

punishment as operant conditioning says. In the case of respondent conditioning, stimuli exert

complete and automatic control over some behaviors. We see this in the case of reflexes. When a

doctor strikes your knee with that little hammer, your leg extends out automatically. Another

example is how a baby will root for a food source if the mother’s breast is placed near their

mouth. And if a nipple is placed in their mouth, they will also automatically suck via the sucking

                                                2-32

reflex. Humans have several of these reflexes, though not as many as other animals due to our

more complicated nervous system.

        Respondent conditioning (also called classical or Pavlovian conditioning) occurs when

we link a previously neutral stimulus with a stimulus that is unlearned or inborn, called an

unconditioned stimulus. In respondent conditioning, learning happens in three phases:

preconditioning, conditioning, and postconditioning. See Figure 2.5 for an overview of Pavlov’s

classic experiment.

        Preconditioning. Notice that preconditioning has both an A and a B panel. All this stage

of learning signifies is that some learning is already present. There is no need to learn it again, as

in the case of primary reinforcers and punishers in operant conditioning. In Panel A, food makes

a dog salivate. This response does not need to be learned and shows the relationship between an

unconditioned stimulus (UCS) yielding an unconditioned response (UCR). Unconditioned means

unlearned. In Panel B, we see that a neutral stimulus (NS) produces no response. Dogs do not

enter the world knowing to respond to the ringing of a bell (which it hears).

        Conditioning. Conditioning is when learning occurs. By pairing a neutral stimulus and

unconditioned stimulus (bell and food, respectively), the dog will learn that the bell ringing (NS)

signals food coming (UCS) and salivate (UCR). The pairing must occur more than once so that

needless pairings are not learned such as someone farting right before your food comes out and

now you salivate whenever someone farts (…at least for a while. Eventually the fact that no food

comes will extinguish this reaction but still, it will be weird for a bit).

Figure 2.5. Pavlov’s Classic Experiment




       Postconditioning. Postconditioning, or after learning has occurred, establishes a new and

not naturally occurring relationship of a conditioned stimulus (CS; previously the NS) and

conditioned response (CR; the same response). So the dog now reliably salivates at the sound of

the bell because he expects that food will follow, and it does.

       Watson and Rayner (1920) conducted one of the most famous studies in psychology.

Essentially, they wanted to explore “the possibility of conditioning various types of emotional

response(s).” The researchers ran a series of trials in which they exposed a 9-month-old child,

known as Little Albert, to a white rat. Little Albert made no response outside of curiosity (NS–

NR not shown). Panel A of Figure 2.6 shows the naturally occurring response to the stimulus of

a loud sound. On later trials, the rat was presented (NS) and followed closely by a loud sound

(UCS; Panel B). After several conditioning trials, the child responded with fear to the mere

presence of the white rat (Panel C).

Figure 2.6. Learning to Fear




       As fears can be learned, so too they can be unlearned. Considered the follow-up to

Watson and Rayner (1920), Jones (1924; Figure 2.7) wanted to see if a child who learned to be

afraid of white rabbits (Panel B) could be conditioned to become unafraid of them. Simply, she

placed the child in one end of a room and then brought in the rabbit. The rabbit was far enough

away so as not to cause distress. Then, Jones gave the child some pleasant food (i.e., something

sweet such as cookies [Panel C]; remember the response to the food is unlearned, i.e., Panel A).

The procedure in Panel C continued with the rabbit being brought a bit closer each time until,

eventually, the child did not respond with distress to the rabbit (Panel D).

Figure 2.7. Unlearning Fears




       This process is called counterconditioning, or the reversal of previous learning.

       Another respondent conditioning way to unlearn a fear is called flooding or exposing the

person to the maximum level of stimulus and as nothing aversive occurs, the link between CS

and UCS producing the CR of fear should break, leaving the person unafraid. That is the idea, at

least. So, if you were afraid of clowns, you would be thrown into a room full of clowns. Hmm….

       Finally, respondent conditioning has several properties:

       •   Respondent Generalization – When many similar CSs or a broad range of CSs elicit

           the same CR. An example is the sound of a whistle eliciting salivation much the same

           as a ringing bell, both detected via audition.

       •   Respondent Discrimination – When a single CS or a narrow range of CSs elicits a

           CR, i.e., teaching the dog to respond to a specific bell and ignore the whistle. The

           whistle would not be followed by food, eventually leading to….

       •   Respondent Extinction – When the CS is no longer paired with the UCS. The sound

           of a school bell ringing (new CS that was generalized) is not followed by food (UCS),

           and so eventually, the dog stops salivating (the CR).

       •   Spontaneous Recovery – When the CS elicits the CR after extinction has occurred.

           Eventually, the school bell will ring, making the dog salivate. If no food comes, the

           behavior will not continue. If food appears, the salivation response will be re-

           established.

       2.3.2.3. Operant conditioning. Influential on the development of Skinner’s operant

conditioning, Thorndike (1905) proposed the law of effect or the idea that if our behavior

produces a favorable consequence, in the future when the same stimulus is present, we will be

more likely to make the response again, expecting the same favorable consequence. Likewise, if

our action leads to dissatisfaction, then we will not repeat the same behavior in the future. He

developed the law of effect thanks to his work with a puzzle box. Cats were food deprived the

night before the experimental procedure was to occur. The next morning, researchers placed a

hungry cat in the puzzle box and set a small amount of food outside the box, just close enough to

be smelled. The cat could escape the box and reach the food by manipulating a series of levers.

Once free, the cat was allowed to eat some food before being promptly returned to the box. With

each subsequent escape and re-insertion into the box, the cat became faster at correctly

manipulating the levers. This scenario demonstrates trial and error learning or making a

response repeatedly if it leads to success. Thorndike also said that stimulus and responses were

connected by the organism and this led to learning. This approach to learning was called

connectionism.

       Operant conditioning is a type of associate learning which focuses on consequences that

follow a response or behavior that we make (anything we do, say, or think/feel) and whether it

makes a behavior more or less likely to occur. This should sound much like what you just read

about in terms of Thorndike’s work. Skinner talked about contingencies or when one thing

occurs due to another. Think of it as an If-Then statement. If I do X, then Y will happen. For

operant conditioning, this means that if I make a behavior, then a specific consequence will

follow. The events (response and consequence) are linked in time.

       What form do these consequences take? There are two main ways they can present

themselves.

           o   Reinforcement – Due to the consequence, a behavior/response is strengthened

               and more likely to occur in the future.

           o   Punishment – Due to the consequence, a behavior/response is weakened and less

               likely to occur in the future.

       Reinforcement and punishment can occur as two types – positive and negative. These

words have no affective connotation to them, meaning they do not imply good or bad. Positive

means that you are giving something – good or bad. Negative means that something is being

taken away – good or bad. Check out the figure below for how these contingencies are arranged.




                                                2-38

Figure 2.8. Contingencies in Operant Conditioning




Let’s go through each:

       •   Positive Punishment (PP) – If something bad or aversive is given or added, then the

           behavior is less likely to occur in the future. If you talk back to your mother and she

           slaps your mouth, this is a PP. Your response of talking back led to the consequence

           of the aversive slap being given to your face. Ouch!!!

       •   Positive Reinforcement (PR) – If something good is given or added, then the

           behavior is more likely to occur in the future. If you study hard and receive an A on

           your exam, you will be more likely to study hard in the future. Similarly, your parents

           may give you money for your stellar performance. Cha Ching!!!

              •       Negative Reinforcement (NR) – This is a tough one for students to

           comprehend because the terms seem counterintuitive, even though we experience NR

           all the time. NR is when something bad or aversive is taken away or subtracted due to

           your actions, making it that you will be more likely to make the same behavior in the
                                              2-39
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


           future when the same stimulus presents itself. For instance, what do you do if you

           have a headache? If you take Tylenol and the pain goes away, you will likely take

           Tylenol in the future when you have a headache. NR can either result in current

           escape behavior or future avoidance behavior. What does this mean? Escape occurs

           when we are presently experiencing an aversive event and want it to end. We make a

           behavior and if the aversive event, like the headache, goes away, we will repeat the

           taking of Tylenol in the future. This future action is an avoidance event. We might

           start to feel a headache coming on and run to take Tylenol right away. By doing so,

           we have removed the possibility of the aversive event occurring, and this behavior

           demonstrates that learning has occurred.

       •   Negative Punishment (NP) – This is when something good is taken away or

           subtracted, making a behavior less likely in the future. If you are late to class and

           your professor deducts 5 points from your final grade (the points are something good

           and the loss is negative), you will hopefully be on time in all subsequent classes.



       The type of reinforcer or punisher we use is crucial. Some are naturally occurring, while

others need to be learned. We describe these as primary and secondary reinforcers and punishers.

Primary refers to reinforcers and punishers that have their effect without having to be learned.

Food, water, temperature, and sex, for instance, are primary reinforcers, while extreme cold or

hot or a punch on the arm are inherently punishing. A story will illustrate the latter. When I was

about eight years old, I would walk up the street in my neighborhood, saying, “I’m Chicken

Little and you can’t hurt me.” Most ignored me, but some gave me the attention I was seeking, a

positive reinforcer. So I kept doing it and doing it until one day, another kid grew tired of hearing

                                                2-40
                                                                         2nd edition as of August 2020


about my other identity and punched me in the face. The pain was enough that I never walked up

and down the street echoing my identity crisis for all to hear. This was a positive punisher that

did not have to be learned, and definitely not one of my finer moments in life.

        Secondary or conditioned reinforcers and punishers are not inherently reinforcing or

punishing but must be learned. An example was the attention I received for saying I was Chicken

Little. Over time I learned that attention was good. Other examples of secondary reinforcers

include praise, a smile, getting money for working or earning good grades, stickers on a board,

points, getting to go out dancing, and getting out of an exam if you are doing well in a class.

Examples of secondary punishers include a ticket for speeding, losing television or video game

privileges, ridicule, or a fee for paying your rent or credit card bill late. Really, the sky is the

limit with reinforcers in particular.

        In operant conditioning, the rule for determining when and how often we will reinforce

the desired behavior is called the reinforcement schedule. Reinforcement can either occur

continuously meaning every time the desired behavior is made the subject will receive some

reinforcer, or intermittently/partially meaning reinforcement does not occur with every behavior.

Our focus will be on partial/intermittent reinforcement.

Figure 2.9. Key Components of Reinforcement Schedules




       Figure 2.9 shows that that are two main components that make up a reinforcement

schedule – when you will reinforce and what is being reinforced. In the case of when, it will be

either fixed or at a set rate, or variable and at a rate that changes. In terms of what is being

reinforced, we will either reinforce responses or time. These two components pair up as follows:

       •   Fixed Ratio schedule (FR) – With this schedule, we reinforce some set number of

           responses. For instance, every twenty problems (fixed) a student gets correct (ratio),

           the teacher gives him an extra credit point. A specific behavior is being reinforced –

           getting problems correct. Note that if we reinforce each occurrence of the behavior,

           the definition of continuous reinforcement, we could also describe this as an FR1

           schedule. The number indicates how many responses have to be made, and in this

           case, it is one.

       •   Variable Ratio schedule (VR) – We might decide to reinforce some varying number

           of responses, such as if the teacher gives him an extra credit point after finishing


                                                 2-42
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


           between 40 and 50 correct problems. This approach is useful if the student is learning

           the material and does not need regular reinforcement. Also, since the schedule

           changes, the student will keep responding in the absence of reinforcement.

       •   Fixed Interval schedule (FI) – With a FI schedule, you will reinforce after some set

           amount of time. Let’s say a company wanted to hire someone to sell their product. To

           attract someone, they could offer to pay them $10 an hour 40 hours a week and give

           this money every two weeks. Crazy idea, but it could work. Saying the person will be

           paid every indicates fixed, and two weeks is time or interval. So, FI.

       •   Variable Interval schedule (VI) – Finally, you could reinforce someone at some

           changing amount of time. Maybe they receive payment on Friday one week, then

           three weeks later on Monday, then two days later on Wednesday, then eight days later

           on Thursday, etc. This could work, right? Not for a job, but maybe we could say we

           are reinforced on a VI schedule if we are.



       Finally, four properties of operant conditioning – extinction, spontaneous recovery,

stimulus generalization, and stimulus discrimination – are important. These are the same four

discussed under respondent conditioning. First, extinction is when something that we do, say,

think/feel has not been reinforced for some time. As you might expect, the behavior will begin to

weaken and eventually stop when this occurs. Does extinction happen as soon as the anticipated

reinforcer is removed? The answer is yes and no, depending on whether we are talking about

continuous or partial reinforcement. With which type of schedule would you expect a person to

stop responding to immediately if reinforcement is not there? Continuous or partial?



                                               2-43
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


       The answer is continuous. If a person is used to receiving reinforcement every time they

perform a particular behavior, and then suddenly no reinforcer is delivered, he or she will cease

the response immediately. Obviously then, with partial, a response continues being made for a

while. Why is this? The person may think the schedule has simply changed. ‘Maybe I am not

paid weekly now. Maybe it changed to biweekly and I missed the email.’ Due to this endurance,

we say that intermittent or partial reinforcement shows resistance to extinction, meaning the

behavior does weaken, but gradually.

       As you might expect, if reinforcement occurs after extinction has started, the behavior

will re-emerge. Consider your parents for a minute. To stop some undesirable behavior you made

in the past, they likely took away some privilege. I bet the bad behavior ended too. But did you

ever go to your grandparent’s house and grandma or grandpa—or worse, BOTH—took pity on

you and let you play your video games (or something equivalent)? I know my grandmother used

to. What happened to that bad behavior that had disappeared? Did it start again and your parents

could not figure out why?

       Additionally, you might have wondered if the person or animal will try to make the

response again in the future even though it stopped being reinforced in the past. The answer is

yes, and one of two outcomes is possible. First, the response is made, and nothing happens. In

this case, extinction continues. Second, the response is made, and a reinforcer is delivered. The

response re-emerges. Consider a rat trained to push a lever to receive a food pellet. If we stop

providing the food pellets, in time, the rat will stop pushing the lever. If the rat pushes the lever

again sometime in the future and food is delivered, the behavior spontaneously recovers. Hence,

this phenomenon is called spontaneous recovery.

       2.3.2.4. Observational learning. There are times when we learn by simply watching

others. This is called observational learning and is contrasted with enactive learning, which is

learning by doing. There is no firsthand experience by the learner in observational learning,

unlike enactive. As you can learn desirable behaviors such as watching how your father bags

groceries at the grocery store (I did this and still bag the same way today), you can learn

undesirable ones too. If your parents resort to alcohol consumption to deal with stressors life

presents, then you also might do the same. The critical part is what happens to the person

modeling the behavior. If my father seems genuinely happy and pleased with himself after

bagging groceries his way, then I will be more likely to adopt this behavior. If my mother or

father consumes alcohol to feel better when things are tough, and it works, then I might do the

same. On the other hand, if we see a sibling constantly getting in trouble with the law, then we

may not model this behavior due to the negative consequences.

       Albert Bandura conducted pivotal research on observational learning, and you likely

already know all about it. Check out Figure 2.10 to see if you do. In Bandura’s experiment,

children were first brought into a room to watch a video of an adult playing nicely or

aggressively with a Bobo doll, which provided a model. Next, the children are placed in a room

with several toys in it. The room contains a highly prized toy, but they are told they cannot play

with it. All other toys are allowed, including a Bobo doll. Children who watched the aggressive

model behaved aggressively with the Bobo doll while those who saw the gentle model, played

nice. Both groups were frustrated when deprived of the coveted toy.

Figure 2.10. Bandura’s Classic Experiment




       According to Bandura, all behaviors are learned by observing others, and we model our

actions after theirs, so undesirable behaviors can be altered or relearned in the same way.

Modeling techniques change behavior by having subjects observe a model in a situation that

usually causes them some anxiety. By seeing the model interact nicely with the fear evoking

stimulus, their fear should subside. This form of behavior therapy is widely used in clinical,

business, and classroom situations. In the classroom, we might use modeling to demonstrate to a

student how to do a math problem. In fact, in many college classrooms, this is exactly what the

instructor does. In the business setting, a model or trainer demonstrates how to use a computer

program or run a register for a new employee.

       However, keep in mind that we do not model everything we see. Why? First, we cannot

pay attention to everything going on around us. We are more likely to model behaviors by
                                                2-46
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


someone who commands our attention. Second, we must remember what a model does to imitate

it. If a behavior is not memorable, it will not be imitated. We must try to convert what we see

into action. If we are not motivated to perform an observed behavior, we probably will not show

what we have learned.

       2.3.2.5. Evaluating the behavioral model. Within the context of psychopathology, the

behavioral perspective is useful because explains maladaptive behavior in terms of learning gone

awry. The good thing is that what is learned can be unlearned or relearned through behavior

modification, the process of changing behavior. To begin, an applied behavior analyst identifies

a target behavior, or behavior to be changed, defines it, works with the client to develop goals,

conducts a functional assessment to understand what the undesirable behavior is, what causes it,

and what maintains it. With this knowledge, a plan is developed and consists of numerous

strategies to act on one or all of these elements – antecedent, behavior, and/or consequence. The

strategies arise from all three learning models. In terms of operant conditioning, strategies

include antecedent manipulations, prompts, punishment procedures, differential reinforcement,

habit reversal, shaping, and programming. Flooding and desensitization are typical respondent

conditioning procedures used with phobias, and modeling arises from social learning theory and

observational learning. Watson and Skinner defined behavior as what we do or say, but later

behaviorists added what we think or feel. In terms of the latter, cognitive behavior modification

procedures arose after the 1960s and with the rise of cognitive psychology. This led to a

cognitive-behavioral perspective that combines concepts from the behavioral and cognitive

models, the latter discussed in the next section.

       Critics of the behavioral perspective point out that it oversimplifies behavior and often

ignores inner determinants of behavior. Behaviorism has also been accused of being mechanistic

                                                2-47
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


and seeing people as machines. This criticism would be true of behaviorism’s first two stages,

though sociobehaviorism steered away from this proposition and even fought against any

mechanistic leanings of behaviorists.

        The greatest strength or appeal of the behavioral model is that its tenets are easily tested

in the laboratory, unlike those of the psychodynamic model. Also, a large number of treatment

techniques have been developed and proven to be effective over the years. For example,

desensitization (Wolpe, 1997) teaches clients to respond calmly to fear-producing stimuli. It

begins with the individual learning a relaxation technique such as diaphragmatic breathing. Next,

a fear hierarchy, or list of feared objects and situations, is constructed in which the individual

moves from least to most feared. Finally, the individual either imagines (systematic) or

experiences in real life (in-vivo) each object or scenario from the hierarchy and uses the

relaxation technique while doing so. This represents the individual pairings of a feared object or

situation and relaxation. So if there are 10 objects/situations in the list, the client will experience

ten such pairings and eventually be able to face each without fear. Outside of phobias,

desensitization has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive

Disorder symptoms (Hakimian and Souza, 2016) and limitedly with the treatment of depression

when co-morbid with OCD (Masoumeh and Lancy, 2016).



2.3.3. The Cognitive Model

        2.3.3.1. What is it? As noted earlier, the idea of people being machines, called

mechanism, was a key feature of behaviorism and other schools of thought in psychology until

about the 1960s or 1970s. In fact, behaviorism said psychology was to be the study of observable

behavior. Any reference to cognitive processes was dismissed as this was not overt, but covert

                                                 2-48
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


according to Watson and later Skinner. Of course, removing cognition from the study of

psychology ignored an important part of what makes us human and separates us from the rest of

the animal kingdom. Fortunately, the work of George Miller, Albert Ellis, Aaron Beck, and

Ulrich Neisser demonstrated the importance of cognitive abilities in understanding thoughts,

behaviors, and emotions, and in the case of psychopathology, show that people can create their

problems by how they come to interpret events experienced in the world around them. How so?

       2.3.3.2. Schemas and cognitive errors. First, consider the topic of social cognition or

the process of collecting and assessing information about others. So what do we do with this

information? Once collected or sensed (sensation is the cognitive process of detecting the

physical energy given off or emitted by physical objects), the information is sent to the brain

through the neural impulse. Once in the brain, it is processed and interpreted. This is where

assessing information about others comes in and involves the cognitive process of perception,

or adding meaning to raw sensory data. We take the information just detected and use it to assign

people to categories, or groups. For each category, we have a schema, or a set of beliefs and

expectations about a group of people, presumed to apply to all members of the group, and based

on experience.

       Can our schemas lead us astray or be false? Consider where students sit in a class. It is

generally understood that the students who sit in the front of the class are the overachievers and

want to earn an A in the class. Those who sit in the back of the room are underachievers who

don’t care. Right? Where do you sit in class, if you are on a physical campus and not an online

student? Is this correct? What about other students in the class that you know? What if you found

out that a friend who sits in the front row is a C student but sits there because he cannot see the

screen or board, even with corrective lenses? What about your friend or acquaintance in the

                                                2-49
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


back? This person is an A student but does not like being right under the nose of the professor,

especially if he/she tends to spit when lecturing. The person in the back could also be shy and

prefer sitting there so that s/he does not need to chat with others as much. Or, they are easily

distracted and sits in the back so that all stimuli are in front of him/her. Again, your schema

about front row and back row students is incorrect and causes you to make certain assumptions

about these individuals. This might even affect how you interact with them. Would you want

notes from the student in the front or back of the class?

       2.3.3.3. Attributions and cognitive errors. Second, consider the very interesting social

psychology topic attribution theory, or the idea that people are motivated to explain their own

and other people’s behavior by attributing causes of that behavior to personal reasons or

dispositional factors that are in the person themselves or linked to some trait they have; or

situational factors that are linked to something outside the person. Like schemas, the attributions

we make can lead us astray. How so? The fundamental attribution error occurs when we

automatically assume a dispositional reason for another person’s actions and ignore situational

factors. In other words, we assume the person who cut us off is an idiot (dispositional) and do not

consider that maybe someone in the car is severely injured and this person is rushing them to the

hospital (situational). Then there is the self-serving bias, which is when we attribute our success

to our own efforts (dispositional) and our failures to external causes (situational). Our attribution

in these two cases is in error, but still, it comes to affect how we see the world and our subjective

well-being.

       2.3.3.4. Maladaptive cognitions. Irrational thought patterns can be the basis of

psychopathology. Throughout this book, we will discuss several treatment strategies used to

change unwanted, maladaptive cognitions, whether they are present as an excess such as with

                                                2-50

paranoia, suicidal ideation, or feelings of worthlessness; or as a deficit such as with self-

confidence and self-efficacy. More specifically, cognitive distortions/maladaptive cognitions can

take the following forms:

       •   Overgeneralizing – You see a larger pattern of negatives based on one event.

       •   Mind Reading – Assuming others know what you are thinking without any evidence.

       •   What if? – Asking yourself ‘what if something happens,’ without being satisfied by

           any of the answers.

       •   Blaming – You focus on someone else as the source of your negative feelings and do

           not take any responsibility for changing yourself.

       •   Personalizing – Blaming yourself for adverse events rather than seeing the role that

           others play.

       •   Inability to disconfirm – Ignoring any evidence that may contradict your maladaptive

           cognition.

       •   Regret orientation – Focusing on what you could have done better in the past rather

           than on improving now.

       •   Dichotomous thinking – Viewing people or events in all-or-nothing terms.



       2.3.3.5. Cognitive therapies. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness

(NAMI), cognitive behavioral therapy “focuses on exploring relationships among a person's

thoughts, feelings and behaviors. During CBT a therapist will actively work with a person to

uncover unhealthy patterns of thought and how they may be causing self-destructive behaviors

and beliefs.” CBT attempts to identify negative or false beliefs and restructure them. They add,

“Oftentimes someone being treated with CBT will have homework in between sessions where

                                                 2-51
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


they practice replacing negative thoughts with more realistic thoughts based on prior experiences

or record their negative thoughts in a journal.” For more on CBT, visit:

https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Treatment/Psychotherapy. Some commonly used strategies

include cognitive restructuring, cognitive coping skills training, and acceptance techniques.

First, you can use cognitive restructuring, also called rational restructuring, in which

maladaptive cognitions are replaced with more adaptive ones. To do this, the client must be

aware of the distressing thoughts, when they occur, and their effect on them. Next, help the client

stop thinking these thoughts and replace them with more rational ones. It’s a simple strategy, but

an important one. Psychology Today published a great article on January 21, 2013, which

described four ways to change your thinking through cognitive restructuring. Briefly, these

included:

       1. Notice when you are having a maladaptive cognition, such as making “negative

            predictions.” Figure out what is the worst thing that could happen and what

            alternative outcomes are possible.

       2. Track the accuracy of the thought. If you believe focusing on a problem generates a

            solution, then write down each time you ruminate and the result. You can generate a

            percentage of times you ruminated to the number of successful problem-solving

            strategies you generated.

       3. Behaviorally test your thought. Try figuring out if you genuinely do not have time to

            go to the gym by recording what you do each day and then look at open times of the

            day. Add them up and see if making some minor, or major, adjustments to your

            schedule will free an hour to get in some valuable exercise.



                                                 2-52

       4. Examine the evidence both for and against your thought. If you do not believe you do

           anything right, list evidence of when you did not do something right and then

           evidence of when you did. Then write a few balanced statements such as the one the

           article suggests, “I’ve made some mistakes that I feel embarrassed about, but a lot of

           the time, I make good choices.”

       The article also suggested a few non-cognitive restructuring techniques, including

mindfulness meditation and self-compassion. For more on these, visit:

       https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-practice/201301/cognitive-restructuring



       The second major CBT strategy is called cognitive coping skills training. This strategy

teaches social skills, communication, assertiveness through direct instruction, role playing, and

modeling. For social skills training, identify the appropriate social behavior such as making eye

contact, saying no to a request, or starting up a conversation with a stranger and determine

whether the client is inhibited from making this behavior due to anxiety. For communication,

decide if the problem is related to speaking, listening, or both and then develop a plan for use in

various interpersonal situations. Finally, assertiveness training aids the client in protecting their

rights and obtaining what they want from others. Those who are not assertive are often overly

passive and never get what they want or are unreasonably aggressive and only get what they

want. Treatment starts with determining situations in which assertiveness is lacking and

developing a hierarchy of assertiveness opportunities. Least difficult situations are handled first,

followed by more difficult situations, all while rehearsing and mastering all the situations present

in the hierarchy. For more on these techniques, visit http://cogbtherapy.com/cognitive-

behavioral-therapy-exercises/.

       Finally, acceptance techniques help reduce a client’s worry and anxiety. Life involves a

degree of uncertainty, and at times we must accept this. Techniques might include weighing the

pros and cons of fighting uncertainty or change. The disadvantages should outweigh the

advantages and help you to end the struggle and accept what is unknown. Chances are you are

already accepting the unknown in some areas of life, and identifying these can help you to see

why it is helpful in these areas, and how you can apply this in more difficult areas. Finally, does

uncertainty always lead to a negative end? We may think so, but a review of the evidence for and

against this statement will show that it does not and reduce how threatening it seems.

       2.3.3.6. Evaluating the cognitive model. The cognitive model made up for an apparent

deficit in the behavioral model – overlooking the role cognitive processes play in our thoughts,

feelings, and behaviors. Right before his death, Skinner (1990) reminded psychologists that the

only thing we can truly know and study was the observable. Cognitive processes cannot be

empirically and reliably measured and should be ignored. Is there merit to this view? Social

desirability states that sometimes participants do not tell us the truth about what they are

thinking, feeling or doing (or have done) because they do not want us to think less of them or to

judge them harshly if they are outside the social norm. In other words, they present themselves in

a favorable light. If this is true, how can we know anything about controversial matters? The

person’s true intentions or thoughts and feelings are not readily available to us, or are covert, and

do not make for useful empirical data. Still, cognitive-behavioral therapies have proven their

efficacy for the treatment of OCD (McKay et al., 2015), perinatal depression (Sockol, 2015),

insomnia (de Bruin et al., 2015), bulimia nervosa (Poulsen et al., 2014), hypochondriasis

(Olatunji et al., 2014), and social anxiety disorder (Leichsenring et al., 2014) to name a few.

Other examples will be discussed throughout this book.

2.3.4. The Humanistic and Existential Perspectives

       2.3.4.1. The humanistic perspective. The humanistic perspective, or third force

psychology (psychoanalysis and behaviorism being the other two forces), emerged in the 1960s

and 1970s as an alternative viewpoint to the largely deterministic view of personality espoused

by psychoanalysis and the view of humans as machines advocated by behaviorism. Key features

of the perspective include a belief in human perfectibility, personal fulfillment, valuing self-

disclosure, placing feelings over intellect, an emphasis on the present, and hedonism. Its key

figures were Abraham Maslow, who proposed the hierarchy of needs, and Carl Rogers, who we

will focus on here.

       Rogers said that all people want to have positive regard from significant others in their

life. When the individual is accepted as they are, they receive unconditional positive regard and

become a fully functioning person. They are open to experience, live every moment to the fullest,

are creative, accepts responsibility for their decisions, do not derive their sense of self from

others, strive to maximize their potential, and are self-actualized. Their family and friends may

disapprove of some of their actions but overall, respect and love them. They then realize their

worth as a person but also that they are not perfect. Of course, most people do not experience this

but instead are made to feel that they can only be loved and respected if they meet certain

standards, called conditions of worth. Hence, they experience conditional positive regard. Their

self-concept becomes distorted, now seen as having worth only when these significant others

approve, leading to a disharmonious state and psychopathology. Individuals in this situation are

unsure of what they feel, value, or need leading to dysfunction and the need for therapy. Rogers

stated that the humanistic therapist should be warm, understanding, supportive, respectful, and

accepting of his/her clients. This approach came to be called client-centered therapy.

        2.3.4.2. The existential perspective. This approach stresses the need for people to re-

create themselves continually and be self-aware, acknowledges that anxiety is a normal part of

life, focuses on free will and self-determination, emphasizes that each person has a unique

identity known only through relationships and the search for meaning, and finally, that we

develop to our maximum potential. Abnormal behavior arises when we avoid making choices, do

not take responsibility, and fail to actualize our full potential. Existential therapy is used to treat

substance abuse, “excessive anxiety, apathy, alienation, nihilism, avoidance, shame, addiction,

despair, depression, guilt, anger, rage, resentment, embitterment, purposelessness, psychosis, and

violence. They also focus on life-enhancing experiences like relationships, love, caring,

commitment, courage, creativity, power, will, presence, spirituality, individuation, self-

actualization, authenticity, acceptance, transcendence, and awe.” For more information, please

visit: https://www.psychologytoday.com/therapy-types/existential-therapy

        2.3.4.3. Evaluating the humanistic and existential perspectives. The biggest criticism

of these models is that the concepts are abstract and fuzzy and so very difficult to research.

Rogers did try to investigate his propositions scientifically, but most other humanistic-existential

psychologists rejected the use of the scientific method. They also have not developed much in

the way of theory, and the perspectives tend to work best with people suffering from adjustment

issues and not as well with severe mental illness. The perspectives do offer hope to people

suffering tragedy by asserting that we control our destiny and can make our own choices.

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   According to Freud, consciousness had three levels (consciousness,
       preconscious, and the unconscious), personality had three parts (the id,
       ego, and superego), personality developed over five stages (oral, anal,
       phallic, latency, and genital), there are ten defense mechanisms to protect
       the ego such as repression and sublimation, and finally three assessment
       techniques (free association, transference, and dream analysis) could be
       used to understand the personalities of his patients and expose repressed
       material.
   •   The behavioral model concerns the cognitive process of learning, which is
       any relatively permanent change in behavior due to experience and
       practice, and has two main forms – associative learning to include classical
       and operant conditioning and observational learning.
   •   Respondent conditioning (also called classical or Pavlovian conditioning)
       occurs when we link a previously neutral stimulus with a stimulus that is
       unlearned or inborn, called an unconditioned stimulus.
   •   Operant conditioning is a type of associate learning which focuses on
       consequences that follow a response or behavior that we make (anything
       we do, say, or think/feel) and whether it makes a behavior more or less
       likely to occur.
   •   Observational learning is learning by watching others and modeling
       techniques change behavior by having subjects observe a model in a
       situation that usually causes them some anxiety.
   •   The cognitive model focuses on schemas, cognitive errors, attributions,
       and maladaptive cognitions and offers strategies such as CBT, cognitive
       restructuring, cognitive coping skills training, and acceptance.
   •   The humanistic perspective focuses on positive regard, conditions of
       worth, and the fully functioning person while the existential perspective
       stresses the need for people to re-create themselves continually and be
       self-aware, acknowledges that anxiety is a normal part of life, focuses on
       free will and self-determination, emphasizes that each person has a unique
       identity known only through relationships and the search for meaning, and
       finally, that we develop to our maximum potential.

                                 2.4. The Sociocultural Model



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the sociocultural model.

       •   Clarify how socioeconomic factors affect mental illness.

       •   Clarify how gender factors affect mental illness.

       •   Clarify how environmental factors affect mental illness.

       •   Clarify how multicultural factors affect mental illness.

       •   Evaluate the sociocultural model.



       Outside of biological and psychological factors on mental illness, race, ethnicity, gender,

religious orientation, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, etc. also play a role, and this is

the basis of the sociocultural model. How so? We will explore a few of these factors in this

section.



2.4.1. Socioeconomic Factors

       Low socioeconomic status has been linked to higher rates of mental and physical illness

(Ng, Muntaner, Chung, & Eaton, 2014) due to persistent concern over unemployment or under-

employment, low wages, lack of health insurance, no savings, and the inability to put food on the

table, which then leads to feeling hopeless, helpless, and dependency on others. This situation

places considerable stress on an individual and can lead to higher rates of anxiety disorders and

depression. Borderline personality disorder has also been found to be higher in people in low-

income brackets (Tomko et al., 2012) and group differences for personality disorders have been

found between African and European Americans (Ryder, Sunohara, and Kirmayer, 2015).



2.4.2. Gender Factors

       Gender plays an important, though at times, unclear role in mental illness. Gender is not a

cause of mental illness, though differing demands placed on males and females by society and

their culture can influence the development and course of a disorder. Consider the following:

       •   Rates of eating disorders are higher among women than men, though both genders are

           affected. In the case of men, muscle dysphoria is of concern and is characterized by

           extreme concern over being more muscular.

       •   OCD has an earlier age of onset in girls than boys, with most people being diagnosed

           by age 19.

       •   Females are at higher risk for developing an anxiety disorder than men.

       •   ADHD is more common in males than females, though females are more likely to

           have inattention issues.

       •   Boys are more likely to be diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.

       •   Depression occurs with greater frequency in women than men.

       •   Women are more likely to develop PTSD compared to men.

       •   Rates of SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder) are four times greater in women than

           men. Interestingly, younger adults are more likely to develop SAD than older adults.

                                      Consider this…
    In relation to men: “Men and women experience many of the same mental disorders
    but their willingness to talk about their feelings may be very different. This is one of
    the reasons that their symptoms may be very different as well. For example, some
    men with depression or an anxiety disorder hide their emotions and may appear to be
    angry or aggressive while many women will express sadness. Some men may turn to
    drugs or alcohol to try to cope with their emotional issues.”

        https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/men-and-mental-health/index.shtml

    In relation to women: “Some women may experience symptoms of mental disorders
    at times of hormone change, such as perinatal depression, premenstrual dysphoric
    disorder, and perimenopause-related depression. When it comes to other mental
    disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, research has not found
    differences in rates that men and women experiences these illnesses. But, women
    may experience these illnesses differently – certain symptoms may be more common
    in women than in men, and the course of the illness can be affected by the sex of the
    individual.”

       https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/women-and-mental-health/index.shtml




2.4.3. Environmental Factors

      Environmental factors also play a role in the development of mental illness. How so?

          •   In the case of borderline personality disorder, many people report experiencing

              traumatic life events such as abandonment, abuse, unstable relationships or

              hostility, and adversity during childhood.

          •   Cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and drug use during pregnancy are risk factors for

              ADHD.

          •   Divorce or the death of a spouse can lead to anxiety disorders.

          •   Trauma, stress, and other extreme stressors are predictive of depression.

            •    Malnutrition before birth, exposure to viruses, and other psychosocial factors are

                 potential causes of schizophrenia.

            •    SAD occurs with greater frequency for those living far north or south from the

                 equator (Melrose, 2015). Horowitz (2008) found that rates of SAD are just 1% for

                 those living in Florida while 9% of Alaskans are diagnosed with the disorder.

2.4.4. Multicultural Factors

        Racial, ethnic, and cultural factors are also relevant to understanding the development

and course of mental illness. Multicultural psychologists assert that both normal behavior and

abnormal behavior need to be understood in the context of the individual’s unique culture and

the group’s value system. Racial and ethnic minorities must contend with prejudice,

discrimination, racism, economic hardships, etc. as part of their daily life and this can lead to

disordered behavior (Lo & Cheng, 2014; Jones, Cross, & DeFour, 2007; Satcher, 2001), though

some research suggests that ethnic identity can buffer against these stressors and protect mental

health (Mossakowski, 2003). To address this unique factor, culture-sensitive therapies have

been developed and include increasing the therapist’s awareness of cultural values, hardships,

stressors, and/or prejudices faced by their client; the identification of suppressed anger and pain;

and raising the client’s self-worth (Prochaska & Norcross, 2013). These therapies have proven

efficacy for the treatment of depression (Kalibatseva & Leong, 2014) and schizophrenia (Naeem

et al., 2015).

2.4.5. Evaluation of the Model

       The sociocultural model has contributed significantly to our understanding of the nuances

of mental illness diagnosis, prognosis, course, and treatment for other races, cultures, genders,

ethnicities. In Module 3, we will discuss diagnosing and classifying abnormal behavior from the

perspective of the DSM 5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition).

Important here is that specific culture- and gender-related diagnostic issues are discussed for

each disorder, demonstrating increased awareness of the impact of these factors. Still, the

sociocultural model suffers from unclear findings and not allowing for the establishment of

causal relationships, reliance on more qualitative data gathered from case studies and

ethnographic analyses (one such example is Zafra, 2016), and an inability to make predictions

about abnormal behavior for individuals.




    You should have learned the following in this section:
        •   The sociocultural model asserts that race, ethnicity, gender, religious orientation,
            socioeconomic status, sexual orientation all play a role in the development and
            treatment of mental illness.


    Section 2.4 Review Questions

        1. How do socioeconomic, gender, environmental, and multicultural factors affect
           mental illness and its treatment?
        2. How effective is the sociocultural model at explaining psychopathology and its
           treatment?

Module Recap

       In Module 2, we first distinguished uni- and multi-dimensional models of abnormality

and made a case that the latter was better to subscribe to. We then discussed biological,

psychological, and sociocultural models of abnormality. In terms of the biological model,

neurotransmitters, brain structures, hormones, genes, and viral infections were identified as

potential causes of mental illness and three treatment options were given. In terms of

psychological perspectives, Freud’s psychodynamic theory; the learning-related research of

Watson, Skinner, and Bandura and Rotter; the cognitive model; and the humanistic and

existential perspectives were discussed. Finally, the sociocultural model indicated the role of

socioeconomic, gender, environmental, and multicultural factors on abnormal behavior.

                     3.1. Clinical Assessment of Abnormal Behavior



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Define clinical assessment.

       •   Clarify why clinical assessment is an ongoing process.

       •   Define and exemplify reliability.

       •   Define and exemplify validity.

       •   Define standardization.

       •   List and describe seven methods of assessment.



3.1.1. What is Clinical Assessment?

       For a mental health professional to be able to effectively help treat a client and know that

the treatment selected worked (or is working), he/she first must engage in the clinical

assessment of the client, or collecting information and drawing conclusions through the use of

observation, psychological tests, neurological tests, and interviews to determine the person’s

problem and the presenting symptoms. This collection of information involves learning about the

client’s skills, abilities, personality characteristics, cognitive and emotional functioning, the

social context in terms of environmental stressors that are faced, and cultural factors particular to

them such as their language or ethnicity. Clinical assessment is not just conducted at the

beginning of the process of seeking help but throughout the process. Why is that?

       Consider this. First, we need to determine if a treatment is even needed. By having a clear

accounting of the person’s symptoms and how they affect daily functioning, we can decide to

what extent the individual is adversely affected. Assuming a treatment is needed, our second
                                                 3-3
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


reason to engage in clinical assessment will be to determine what treatment will work best. As

you will see later in this module, there are numerous approaches to treatment. These include

Behavior Therapy, Cognitive and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Humanistic-

Experiential Therapies, Psychodynamic Therapies, Couples and Family Therapy, and biological

treatments (psychopharmacology). Of course, for any mental disorder, some of the

aforementioned therapies will have greater efficacy than others. Even if several can work well, it

does not mean a particular therapy will work well for that specific client. Assessment can help

figure this out. Finally, we need to know if the treatment we employed worked. This will involve

measuring before any treatment is used and then measuring the behavior while the treatment is in

place. We will even want to measure after the treatment ends to make sure symptoms of the

disorder do not return. Knowing what the person’s baselines are for different aspects of

psychological functioning will help us to see when improvement occurs.

       In recap, obtaining the baselines happens in the beginning, implementing the treatment

plan that is agreed upon happens more so in the middle, and then making sure the treatment

produces the desired outcome occurs at the end. It should be clear from this discussion that

clinical assessment is an ongoing process.



3.1.2. Key Concepts in Assessment

       The assessment process involves three critical concepts – reliability, validity, and

standardization. Actually, these three are important to science in general. First, we want the

assessment to be reliable or consistent. Outside of clinical assessment, when our car has an issue

and we take it to the mechanic, we want to make sure that what one mechanic says is wrong with

our car is the same as what another says, or even two others. If not, the measurement tools they

                                                3-4
                                                                         2nd edition as of August 2020


use to assess cars are flawed. The same is true of a patient who is suffering from a mental

disorder. If one mental health professional says the person suffers from major depressive

disorder and another says the issue is borderline personality disorder, then there is an issue with

the assessment tool being used (in this case, the DSM and more on that in a bit). Ensuring that

two different raters are consistent in their assessment of patients is called interrater reliability.

Another type of reliability occurs when a person takes a test one day, and then the same test on

another day. We would expect the person’s answers to be consistent, which is called test-retest

reliability. For example, let’s say the person takes the MMPI on Tuesday and then the same test

on Friday. Unless something miraculous or tragic happened over the two days in between tests,

the scores on the MMPI should be nearly identical to one another. What does identical mean?

The score at test and the score at retest are correlated with one another. If the test is reliable, the

correlation should be very high (remember, a correlation goes from -1.00 to +1.00, and positive

means as one score goes up, so does the other, so the correlation for the two tests should be high

on the positive side).

        In addition to reliability, we want to make sure the test measures what it says it measures.

This is called validity. Let’s say a new test is developed to measure symptoms of depression. It

is compared against an existing and proven test, such as the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).

If the new test measures depression, then the scores on it should be highly comparable to the

ones obtained by the BDI. This is called concurrent or descriptive validity. We might even ask if

an assessment tool looks valid. If we answer yes, then it has face validity, though it should be

noted that this is not based on any statistical or evidence-based method of assessing validity. An

example would be a personality test that asks about how people behave in certain situations.



                                                  3-5
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


Therefore, it seems to measure personality, or we have an overall feeling that it measures what

we expect it to measure.

        Predictive validity is when a tool accurately predicts what will happen in the future. Let’s

say we want to tell if a high school student will do well in college. We might create a national

exam to test needed skills and call it something like the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). We

would have high school students take it by their senior year and then wait until they are in

college for a few years and see how they are doing. If they did well on the SAT, we would

expect that at that point, they should be doing well in college. If so, then the SAT accurately

predicts college success. The same would be true of a test such as the Graduate Record Exam

(GRE) and its ability to predict graduate school performance.

        Finally, we want to make sure that the experience one patient has when taking a test or

being assessed is the same as another patient taking the test the same day or on a different day,

and with either the same tester or another tester. This is accomplished with the use of clearly laid

out rules, norms, and/or procedures, and is called standardization. Equally important is that

mental health professionals interpret the results of the testing in the same way, or otherwise, it

will be unclear what the meaning of a specific score is.



3.1.3. Methods of Assessment

        So how do we assess patients in our care? We will discuss observation, psychological

tests, neurological tests, the clinical interview, and a few others in this section.

        3.1.3.1. Observation. In Section 1.5.2.1 we talked about two types of observation –

naturalistic, or observing the person or animal in their environment, and laboratory, or observing

the organism in a more controlled or artificial setting where the experimenter can use

                                                  3-6
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


sophisticated equipment and videotape the session to examine it at a later time. One-way mirrors

can also be used. A limitation of this method is that the process of recording a behavior causes

the behavior to change, called reactivity. Have you ever noticed someone staring at you while

you sat and ate your lunch? If you have, what did you do? Did you change your behavior? Did

you become self-conscious? Likely yes, and this is an example of reactivity. Another issue is that

the behavior made in one situation may not be made in other situations, such as your significant

other only acting out at the football game and not at home. This form of validity is called cross-

sectional validity. We also need our raters to observe and record behavior in the same way or to

have high inter-rater reliability.

        3.1.3.2. The clinical interview. A clinical interview is a face-to-face encounter between

a mental health professional and a patient in which the former observes the latter and gathers

data about the person’s behavior, attitudes, current situation, personality, and life history. The

interview may be unstructured in which open-ended questions are asked, structured in which a

specific set of questions according to an interview schedule are asked, or semi-structured, in

which there is a pre-set list of questions, but clinicians can follow up on specific issues that catch

their attention. A mental status examination is used to organize the information collected

during the interview and systematically evaluates the patient through a series of questions

assessing appearance and behavior. The latter includes grooming and body posture, thought

processes and content to include disorganized speech or thought and false beliefs, mood and

affect such that whether the person feels hopeless or elated, intellectual functioning to include

speech and memory, and awareness of surroundings to include where the person is and what the

day and time are. The exam covers areas not normally part of the interview and allows the



                                                 3-7
                                                                         2nd edition as of August 2020


mental health professional to determine which areas need to be examined further. The limitation

of the interview is that it lacks reliability, especially in the case of the unstructured interview.

        3.1.3.3. Psychological tests and inventories. Psychological tests assess the client’s

personality, social skills, cognitive abilities, emotions, behavioral responses, or interests. They

can be administered either individually or to groups in paper or oral fashion. Projective tests

consist of simple ambiguous stimuli that can elicit an unlimited number of responses. They

include the Rorschach or inkblot test and the Thematic Apperception Test which asks the

individual to write a complete story about each of 20 cards shown to them and give details about

what led up to the scene depicted, what the characters are thinking, what they are doing, and

what the outcome will be. From the response, the clinician gains perspective on the patient’s

worries, needs, emotions, conflicts, and the individual always connects with one of the people on

the card. Another projective test is the sentence completion test and asks individuals to finish an

incomplete sentence. Examples include ‘My mother…’ or ‘I hope…’

        Personality inventories ask clients to state whether each item in a long list of statements

applies to them, and could ask about feelings, behaviors, or beliefs. Examples include the MMPI

or Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory and the NEO-PI-R, which is a concise measure

of the five major domains of personality – Neuroticism, Extroversion, Openness, Agreeableness,

and Conscientiousness. Six facets define each of the five domains, and the measure assesses

emotional, interpersonal, experimental, attitudinal, and motivational styles (Costa & McCrae,

1992). These inventories have the advantage of being easy to administer by either a professional

or the individual taking it, are standardized, objectively scored, and can be completed

electronically or by hand. That said, personality cannot be directly assessed, and so you do not

ever completely know the individual.

                                                  3-8
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


       3.1.3.4. Neurological tests. Neurological tests are used to diagnose cognitive

impairments caused by brain damage due to tumors, infections, or head injuries; or changes in

brain activity. Positron Emission Tomography or PET is used to study the brain’s chemistry. It

begins by injecting the patient with a radionuclide that collects in the brain and then having them

lie on a scanning table while a ring-shaped machine is positioned over their head. Images are

produced that yield information about the functioning of the brain. Magnetic Resonance Imaging

or MRI provides 3D images of the brain or other body structures using magnetic fields and

computers. It can detect brain and spinal cord tumors or nervous system disorders such as

multiple sclerosis. Finally, computed tomography or the CT scan involves taking X-rays of the

brain at different angles and is used to diagnose brain damage caused by head injuries or brain

tumors.

       3.1.3.5. Physical examination. Many mental health professionals recommend the patient

see their family physician for a physical examination, which is much like a check-up. Why is

that? Some organic conditions, such as hyperthyroidism or hormonal irregularities, manifest

behavioral symptoms that are similar to mental disorders. Ruling out such conditions can save

costly therapy or surgery.

       3.1.3.6. Behavioral assessment. Within the realm of behavior modification and applied

behavior analysis, we talk about what is called behavioral assessment, which is the

measurement of a target behavior. The target behavior is whatever behavior we want to change,

and it can be in excess and needing to be reduced, or in a deficit state and needing to be

increased. During the behavioral assessment we learn about the ABCs of behavior in which

Antecedents are the environmental events or stimuli that trigger a behavior; Behaviors are what

the person does, says, thinks/feels; and Consequences are the outcome of a behavior that either

                                                3-9
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


encourages it to be made again in the future or discourages its future occurrence. Though we

might try to change another person’s behavior using behavior modification, we can also change

our own behavior, which is called self-modification. The person does their own measuring and

recording of the ABCs, which is called self-monitoring. In the context of psychopathology,

behavior modification can be useful in treating phobias, reducing habit disorders, and ridding the

person of maladaptive cognitions.

       3.1.3.7. Intelligence tests. Intelligence testing determines the patient’s level of cognitive

functioning and consists of a series of tasks asking the patient to use both verbal and nonverbal

skills. An example is the Stanford-Binet Intelligence test, which assesses fluid reasoning,

knowledge, quantitative reasoning, visual-spatial processing, and working memory. Intelligence

tests have been criticized for not predicting future behaviors such as achievement and reflecting

social or cultural factors/biases and not actual intelligence. Also, can we really assess

intelligence through one dimension, or are there multiple dimensions?

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   Clinical assessment is the collecting of information and drawing conclusions
       through the use of observation, psychological tests, neurological tests, and
       interviews.
   •   Reliability refers to consistency in measurement and can take the form of
       interrater and test-retest reliability.
   •   Validity is when we ensure the test measures what it says it measures and
       takes the forms of concurrent or descriptive, face, and predictive validity.
   •   Standardization is all the clearly laid out rules, norms, and/or procedures to
       ensure the experience each participant has is the same.
   •   Patients are assessed through observation, psychological tests, neurological
       tests, and the clinical interview, all with their own strengths and limitations.

3.2.1. Clinical Diagnosis and Classification Systems

       Before starting any type of treatment, the client/patient must be clearly diagnosed with a

mental disorder. Clinical diagnosis is the process of using assessment data to determine if the

pattern of symptoms the person presents with is consistent with the diagnostic criteria for a

specific mental disorder outlined in an established classification system such as the DSM-5 or

ICD-10 (both will be described shortly). Any diagnosis should have clinical utility, meaning it

aids the mental health professional in determining prognosis, the treatment plan, and possible

outcomes of treatment (APA, 2013). Receiving a diagnosis does not necessarily mean the person

requires treatment. This decision is made based upon how severe the symptoms are, level of

distress caused by the symptoms, symptom salience such as expressing suicidal ideation, risks
                                               3-12
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


and benefits of treatment, disability, and other factors (APA, 2013). Likewise, a patient may not

meet the full criteria for a diagnosis but require treatment nonetheless.

       Symptoms that cluster together regularly are called a syndrome. If they also follow the

same, predictable course, we say that they are characteristic of a specific disorder.

Classification systems provide mental health professionals with an agreed-upon list of disorders

falling into distinct categories for which there are clear descriptions and criteria for making a

diagnosis. Distinct is the keyword here. People suffering from delusions, hallucinations,

disorganized speech, catatonia, and/or negative symptoms are different from people presenting

with a primary clinical deficit in cognitive functioning that is not developmental but has been

acquired (i.e., they have shown a decline in cognitive functioning over time). The former suffers

from a schizophrenia spectrum disorder while the latter suffers from a NCD or neurocognitive

disorder. The latter can be further distinguished from neurodevelopmental disorders which

manifest early in development and involve developmental deficits that cause impairments in

social, academic, or occupational functioning (APA, 2013). These three disorder groups or

categories can be clearly distinguished from one another. Classification systems also permit the

gathering of statistics to determine incidence and prevalence rates and conform to the

requirements of insurance companies for the payment of claims.

       The most widely used classification system in the United States is the Diagnostic and

Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders currently in its 5th edition and produced by the American

Psychiatric Association (APA, 2013). Alternatively, the World Health Organization (WHO)

publishes the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems

(ICD) currently in its 10th edition, with an 11th edition expected to be published in 2018. We

will begin by discussing the DSM and then move to the ICD.

3.2.2. The DSM Classification System

       3.2.2.1. A brief history of the DSM. The DSM-5 was published in 2013 and took the

place of the DSM IV-TR (TR means Text Revision; published in 2000), but the history of the

DSM goes back to 1944 when the American Psychiatric Association published a predecessor of

the DSM which was a “statistical classification of institutionalized mental patients” and “…was

designed to improve communication about the types of patients cared for in these hospitals”

(APA, 2013, p. 6). The DSM evolved through four major editions after World War II into a

diagnostic classification system to be used psychiatrists and physicians, but also other mental

health professionals. The Herculean task of revising the DSM began in 1999 when the APA

embarked upon an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the DSM in coordination with

the World Health Organization (WHO) Division of Mental Health, the World Psychiatric

Association, and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). This collaboration resulted in

the publication of a monograph in 2002 called A Research Agenda for DSM-V. From 2003 to

2008, the APA, WHO, NIMH, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and the National

Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA) convened 13 international DSM-5

research planning conferences “to review the world literature in specific diagnostic areas to

prepare for revisions in developing both DSM-5 and the International Classification of Disease,

11th Revision (ICD-11)” (APA, 2013).

       After the naming of a DSM-5 Task Force Chair and Vice-Chair in 2006, task force

members were selected and approved by 2007, and workgroup members were approved in 2008.

This group undertook an intensive process of “conducting literature reviews and secondary

analyses, publishing research reports in scientific journals, developing draft diagnostic criteria,

posting preliminary drafts on the DSM-5 website for public comment, presenting preliminary

findings at professional meetings, performing field trials, and revisiting criteria and text”(APA,

2013).

         The result was a “common language for communication between clinicians about the

diagnosis of disorders” along with a realization that the criteria and disorders contained within

were based on current research and may undergo modification with new evidence gathered “both

within and across the domains of proposed disorders” (APA, 2013). Additionally, some disorders

were not included within the main body of the document because they did not have the scientific

evidence to support their widespread clinical use, but were included in Section III under

“Conditions for Further Study” to “highlight the evolution and direction of scientific advances in

these areas to stimulate further research” (APA, 2013).

         3.2.2.2. Elements of a diagnosis. The DSM 5 states that the following make up the key

elements of a diagnosis (APA, 2013):

         •   Diagnostic Criteria and Descriptors – Diagnostic criteria are the guidelines for

             making a diagnosis. When the full criteria are met, mental health professionals can

             add severity and course specifiers to indicate the patient’s current presentation. If the

             full criteria are not met, designators such as “other specified” or “unspecified” can be

             used. If applicable, an indication of severity (mild, moderate, severe, or extreme),

             descriptive features, and course (type of remission – partial or full – or recurrent) can

             be provided with the diagnosis. The final diagnosis is based on the clinical interview,

             text descriptions, criteria, and clinical judgment.

         •   Subtypes and Specifiers – Subtypes denote “mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive

             phenomenological subgroupings within a diagnosis” (APA, 2013). For example, non-

             rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep arousal disorders can have either a sleepwalking

                                                  3-15
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


             or sleep terror type. Enuresis is nocturnal only, diurnal only, or both. Specifiers are

             not mutually exclusive or jointly exhaustive and so more than one specifier can be

             given. For instance, binge eating disorder has remission and severity specifiers.

             Somatic symptom disorder has a specifier for severity, if with predominant pain,

             and/or if persistent. Again, the fundamental distinction between subtypes and

             specifiers is that there can be only one subtype but multiple specifiers.

       •     Principle Diagnosis – A principal diagnosis is used when more than one diagnosis is

             given for an individual. It is the reason for the admission in an inpatient setting or the

             basis for a visit resulting in ambulatory care medical services in outpatient settings.

             The principal diagnosis is generally the focus of treatment.

       •     Provisional Diagnosis – If not enough information is available for a mental health

             professional to make a definitive diagnosis, but there is a strong presumption that the

             full criteria will be met with additional information or time, then the provisional

             specifier can be used.

       3.2.2.3. DSM-5 disorder categories. The DSM-5 includes the following categories of

disorders:




                                                  3-16

3.2.3. The ICD-10

       In 1893, the International Statistical Institute adopted the International List of Causes of

Death which was the first international classification edition. The World Health Organization

was entrusted with the development of the ICD in 1948 and published the 6th version (ICD-6).

The ICD-10 was endorsed in May 1990 by the 43rd World Health Assembly. The WHO states:


                                               3-18
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


ICD is the foundation for the identification of health trends and statistics globally, and the

international standard for reporting diseases and health conditions. It is the diagnostic

classification standard for all clinical and research purposes. ICD defines the universe of

diseases, disorders, injuries and other related health conditions, listed in a comprehensive,

hierarchical fashion that allows for:

       •   easy storage, retrieval and analysis of health information for evidence-based decision-

           making;

       •   sharing and comparing health information between hospitals, regions, settings and

           countries;

       •   and data comparisons in the same location across different time periods.

Source: http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/



       The ICD lists many types of diseases and disorders to include Chapter V: Mental and

Behavioral Disorders. The list of mental disorders is broken down as follows:

       •   Organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders

       •   Mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use

       •   Schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders

       •   Mood (affective) disorders

       •   Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders

       •   Behavioral syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors

       •   Disorders of adult personality and behavior

       •   Mental retardation

       •   Disorders of psychological development

                                                3-19
                                                                         2nd edition as of August 2020


       •       Behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and

               adolescence

       •       Unspecified mental disorder



3.2.4. Harmonization of DSM-5 and ICD-11

       As noted earlier, the ICD-11 is currently in development with an expected publication

date of 2018. According to the DSM-5, there is an effort to harmonize the two classification

systems for a more accurate collection of national health statistics and design of clinical trials,

increased ability to replicate scientific findings across national boundaries, and to rectify the

issue of DSM-IV and ICD-10 diagnoses not agreeing (APA, 2013).




    You should have learned the following in this section:
           •   Clinical diagnosis is the process of using assessment data to determine if the
               pattern of symptoms the person presents with is consistent with the diagnostic
               criteria for a specific mental disorder outlined in an established classification
               system such as the DSM-5 or ICD-10.
           •   Classification systems provide mental health professionals with an agreed-
               upon list of disorders falling into distinct categories for which there are clear
               descriptions and criteria for making a diagnosis.
           •   Elements of a diagnosis in the DSM include the diagnostic criteria and
               descriptors, subtypes and specifiers, the principle diagnosis, and a provisional
               diagnosis.

                   3.3. Treatment of Mental Disorders – An Overview



Section Learning Objectives

    •   Clarify reasons why an individual may need to seek treatment.

    •   Critique myths about psychotherapy.



3.3.1. Seeking Treatment

        3.3.1.1. Who seeks treatment? Would you describe the people who seek treatment as

being on the brink, crazy, or desperate? Or can the ordinary Joe in need of advice seek out

mental health counseling? The answer is that anyone can. David Sack, M.D. (2013) writes in the

article 5 Signs Its Time to Seek Therapy, published in Psychology Today, that “most people can

benefit from therapy at least some point in their lives,” and though the signs you need to seek

help are obvious at times, we often try “to sustain [our] busy life until it sets in that life has

become unmanageable.” So, when should we seek help? First, if we feel sad, angry, or not like

ourselves. We might be withdrawing from friends and families or sleeping more or less than we

usually do. Second, if we are abusing drugs, alcohol, food, or sex to deal with life’s problems. In

this case, our coping skills may need some work. Third, in instances when we have lost a loved

one or something else important to us, whether due to death or divorce, the grief may be too

much to process. Fourth, a traumatic event may have occurred, such as abuse, a crime, an

accident, chronic illness, or rape. Finally, if you have stopped doing the things you enjoy the

most. Sack (2013) says, “If you decide that therapy is worth a try, it doesn’t mean you’re in for a

lifetime of head shrinking.” A 2001 study in the Journal of Counseling Psychology found that

most people feel better within seven to 10 visits. In another study, published in 2006 in the
                                                  3-21

       3.3.1.2. When friends, family, and self-healing are not enough. If you are experiencing

any of the aforementioned issues, you should seek help. Instead of facing the potential stigma of

talking to a mental health professional, many people think that talking through their problems

with friends or family is just as good. Though you will ultimately need these people to see you

through your recovery, they do not have the training and years of experience that a psychologist

or similar professional has. “Psychologists can recognize behavior or thought patterns

objectively, more so than those closest to you who may have stopped noticing — or maybe never

noticed. A psychologist might offer remarks or observations similar to those in your existing

relationships, but their help may be more effective due to their timing, focus, or your trust in

their neutral stance” (http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/psychotherapy-myths.aspx). You also

should not wait to recover on your own. It is not a failure to admit you need help, and there could

be a biological issue that makes it almost impossible to heal yourself.

       3.3.1.3. What exactly is psychotherapy? According to the APA, in psychotherapy

“psychologists apply scientifically validated procedures to help people develop healthier, more

effective habits.” Several different approaches can be utilized to include behavior, cognitive and

cognitive-behavior, humanistic-experiential, psychodynamic, couples and family, and biological

treatments.

                                                3-22

       3.3.1.4. The client-therapist relationship. What is the ideal client-therapist relationship?

APA says, “Psychotherapy is a collaborative treatment based on the relationship between an

individual and a psychologist. Grounded in dialogue, it provides a supportive environment that

allows you to talk openly with someone who’s objective, neutral and nonjudgmental. You and

your psychologist will work together to identify and change the thought and behavior patterns

that are keeping you from feeling your best.” It’s not just about solving the problem you saw the

therapist for, but also about learning new skills to help you cope better in the future when faced

with the same or similar environmental stressors.

       So how do you find a psychotherapist? Several strategies may prove fruitful. You could

ask family and friends, your primary care physician (PCP), look online, consult an area

community mental health center, your local university’s psychology department, state

psychological association, or use APA’s Psychologist Locator Service

(https://locator.apa.org/?_ga=2.160567293.1305482682.1516057794-1001575750.1501611950).

Once you find a list of psychologists or other practitioners, choose the right one for you by

determining if you plan on attending alone or with family, what you wish to get out of your time

with a psychotherapist, how much your insurance company pays for and if you have to pay out

of pocket how much you can afford, when you can attend sessions, and how far you are willing

to travel to see the mental health professional. Once you have done this, make your first

appointment.

       But what should you bring? APA suggests, “to make the most of your time, make a list of

the points you want to cover in your first session and what you want to work on in

psychotherapy. Be prepared to share information about what’s bringing you to the psychologist.

Even a vague idea of what you want to accomplish can help you and your psychologist proceed

efficiently and effectively.” Additionally, they suggest taking report cards, a list of medications,

information on the reasons for a referral, a notebook, a calendar to schedule future visits if

needed, and a form of payment. What you take depends on the reason for the visit.

In terms of what you should expect, you and your therapist will work to develop a full history

which could take several visits. From this, a treatment plan will be developed. “This

collaborative goal-setting is important, because both of you need to be invested in achieving your

goals. Your psychologist may write down the goals and read them back to you, so you’re both

clear about what you’ll be working on. Some psychologists even create a treatment contract that

lays out the purpose of treatment, its expected duration and goals, with both the individual’s and

psychologist’s responsibilities outlined.”

       After the initial visit, the mental health professional may conduct tests to further

understand your condition but will continue talking through the issue. He/she may even suggest

involving others, especially in cases of relationship issues. Resilience is a skill that will be taught

so that you can better handle future situations.

       3.3.1.5. Does it work? APA writes, “Reviews of these studies show that about 75 percent

of people who enter psychotherapy show some benefit. Other reviews have found that the

average person who engages in psychotherapy is better off by the end of treatment than 80

percent of those who don’t receive treatment at all.” Treatment works due to finding evidence-

based treatment that is specific for the person’s problem; the expertise of the therapist; and the

characteristics, values, culture, preferences, and personality of the client.

       3.3.1.6. How do you know you are finished? “How long psychotherapy takes depends

on several factors: the type of problem or disorder, the patient's characteristics and history, the

patient's goals, what's going on in the patient's life outside psychotherapy and how fast the

patient is able to make progress.” It is important to note that psychotherapy is not a lifelong

commitment, and it is a joint decision of client and therapist as to when it ends. Once over,

expect to have a periodic check-up with your therapist. This might be weeks or even months

after your last session. If you need to see him/her sooner, schedule an appointment. APA calls

this a “mental health tune up” or a “booster session.”

Module Recap

       That’s it. With the conclusion of Module 3, you now have the necessary foundation to

understand each of the groups of disorders we discuss beginning in Module 4 and through

Module 14.

       In Module 3 we reviewed clinical assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. In terms of

assessment, we covered key concepts such as reliability, validity, and standardization; and

discussed methods of assessment such as observation, the clinical interview, psychological tests,

personality inventories, neurological tests, the physical examination, behavioral assessment, and

intelligence tests. In terms of diagnosis, we discussed the classification systems of the DSM-5

and ICD-10. For treatment, we discussed the reasons why someone may seek treatment, self-

treatment, psychotherapy, the client-centered relationship, and how well psychotherapy works.

                   4.1. Clinical Presentation – Depressive Disorders



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Identify and describe the two types of depressive disorders.

       •   Classify symptoms of depression.



       Within mood disorders are two distinct groups—individuals with depressive disorders

and individuals with bipolar disorders. The key difference between the two mood disorder

groups is episodes of mania/hypomania. More specifically, for a diagnosis of a bipolar disorder,

the individual must experience an episode of mania or hypomania that can alternate with periods

of depression; for a diagnosis of a depressive disorder, the individual must not ever experience a

period of mania/hypomania.

       The two most common types of depressive disorders are Major Depressive Disorder

and Persistent Depressive Disorder. Persistent Depressive Disorder, previously known as

Dysthymia, is a continuous and chronic form of depression. While the symptoms of Persistent

Depressive Disorder are very similar to Major Depressive Disorder, they are usually less acute,

as symptoms tend to ebb and flow over a long period of time (more than two years).

        When making a diagnosis of depression, there are a wide range of symptoms that may be

present. These symptoms can generally be categorized into four categories: mood, behavioral,

cognitive, and physical symptoms.



4.1.1. Mood

        While clinical depression can vary in its presentation among individuals, most, if not all

individuals with depression will report significant mood disturbances such as a depressed mood

for most of the day and/or feelings of anhedonia, which is the loss of interest in previously

interesting activities.



4.1.2. Behavioral

        Behavioral issues such as decreased physical activity and reduced productivity—both at

home and work—are often observed in individuals with depression. This is typically where a

disruption in daily functioning occurs as individuals with depressive disorders are unable to

maintain their social interactions and employment responsibilities.



4.1.3. Cognitive

        It should not come as a surprise that there is a serious disruption in cognitions as

individuals with depressive disorders typically hold a negative view of themselves and the world

around them. They are quick to blame themselves when things go wrong, and rarely take credit

when they experience positive achievements. Individuals with depressive disorders often feel

worthless, which creates a negative feedback loop by reinforcing their overall depressed mood.

Individuals with depressive disorder also report difficulty concentrating on tasks, as they are
                                                 4-4

easily distracted from outside stimuli. This assertion is supported by research that has found

individuals with depression perform worse than those without depression on tasks of memory,

attention, and reasoning (Chen et al., 2013). Finally, thoughts of suicide and self-harm do

occasionally occur in those with depressive disorders; this will be discussed in the epidemiology

section in more detail.



4.1.4. Physical

       Changes in sleep patterns are common in those experiencing depression with reports of

both hypersomnia and insomnia. Hypersomnia, or excessive sleeping, often impacts an

individual’s daily functioning as they spend majority of their time sleeping as opposed to

participating in daily activities (i.e., meeting up with friends, getting to work on time). Reports of

insomnia are also frequent and can occur at various points throughout the night to include

difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking too early with the inability to fall back asleep

before having to wake for the day. Although it is unclear whether symptoms of fatigue or loss of

energy are related to insomnia issues, the fact that those experiencing hypersomnia also report

symptoms of fatigue suggests that these symptoms are a component of the disorder rather than a

secondary symptom of sleep disturbance.

       Additional physical symptoms, such as a change in weight or eating behaviors, are also

observed. Some individuals who are experiencing depression report a lack of appetite, often

forcing themselves to eat something during the day. On the contrary, others overeat, often

seeking “comfort foods,” such as those high in carbohydrates. Due to these changes in eating

behaviors, there may be associated changes in weight.

       Finally, psychomotor agitation or retardation, which is the purposeless or slowed physical

movement of the body (i.e., pacing around a room, tapping toes, restlessness, etc.) is also

reported in individuals with depressive disorders.



4.1.5. Diagnostic Criteria

       According to the DSM-5 (APA, 2013), in order to meet criteria for a diagnosis of major

depressive disorder, an individual must experience at least five symptoms across the four

categories discussed above, in addition to either a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure

in activities. These symptoms must be present for at least two weeks.

       For a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder, an individual must experience a

depressed mood for most of the day for at least two years (APA, 2013). This feeling of a

depressed mood is also accompanied by two or more of the previously discussed symptoms. The

individual may experience a temporary relief of symptoms; however, the individual will not be

without symptoms for more than two months during this two-year period.

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   Mood disorder fall into one of two groups – depressive or bipolar disorders –
       with the key distinction between the two being episodes of mania/hypomania.
   •   Persistent Depressive Disorder shares symptoms with Major Depressive
       Disorder though they are usually not as severe and ebb and flow over a period
       of at least two years.
   •   Symptoms of depression fall into one of four categories – mood, behavioral,
       cognitive, and physical.

                      4.2. Clinical Presentation – Bipolar Disorders



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Distinguish the forms bipolar disorder takes.

       •   Describe a manic episode.

       •   Define cyclothymic disorder.



       According to the DSM-5 (APA, 2013), there are two types of Bipolar Disorder- Bipolar I

and Bipolar II. A diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder is made when there is at least one manic

episode. This manic episode can be preceded by or followed by a hypomanic or major

depressive episode, however, diagnostic criteria for a manic episode is the only criteria that needs

to be met for a Bipolar I diagnosis. A diagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder is made when there is a

current or history of a hypomanic episode and a current or past major depressive episode. In

simpler words, if an individual has ever experienced a manic episode, they qualify for a Bipolar I

diagnosis; however, if the criteria has only been met for a hypomanic episode, the individual

qualifies for a Bipolar II diagnosis.

       4.2.1. Manic Episode. So, what defines a manic episode? The key feature of a manic

episode is a specific period of time in which an individual reports abnormal, persistent, or

expansive irritable mood for nearly all day, every day, for at least one week (APA, 2013).

Additionally, the individual will display increased activity or energy during this same time. With

regards to mood, an individual in a manic episode will appear excessively happy, often engaging

haphazardly in sexual or personal interactions. They also display rapid shifts in mood, also

known as mood lability, ranging from happy, neutral, to irritable.
                                                4-8
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


        Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity is also present during a manic episode. Occasionally

these inflated self-esteem levels can appear delusional. For example, individuals may believe

they are friends with a celebrity, do not need to abide by laws, or even perceive themselves as

God.

        Despite the increased activity level, individuals experiencing a manic episode also require

a decreased need for sleep, sleeping as little as a few hours a night yet still feeling rested.

Reduced need for sleep may also be a precursor to a manic episode, suggesting that a manic

episode is to begin imminently. It is not uncommon for those in a manic episode to have rapid,

pressured speech. It can be difficult to follow their conversation due to the quick pace of their

talking, as well as tangential storytelling. Additionally, they can be difficult to interrupt in

conversation, often disregarding the reciprocal nature of communication. If the individual is

more irritable than expansive, speech can become hostile and they engage in tirades, particularly

if they are interrupted or not allowed to engage in an activity they are seeking out (APA, 2013).

Based on their speech pattern, it should not be a surprise that racing thoughts and flights of ideas

also present during manic episodes. Because of these rapid thoughts, speech may become

disorganized or incoherent.

        4.2.2. Hypomanic Episode. As mentioned above, for a Bipolar II diagnosis, an

individual must report symptoms consistent with a major depressive episode and at least one

hypomanic episode. An individual with Bipolar II disorder must not have a history of a manic

episode—if there is a history of mania, the diagnosis will be diagnosed with Bipolar I. A

hypomanic episode is similar to a manic episode in that the individual will experience

abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and energy levels, however,



                                                  4-9
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


the behaviors are not as extreme as in mania. Behaviors consistent with a hypomanic episode

must be present for at least four days, compared to the one week in a manic episode.

       Notably, there is a subclass of individuals who experience periods of hypomanic

symptoms and mild depressive symptoms (i.e., do not fully meet criteria for a depressive

episode). These individuals are diagnosed with cyclothymic disorder (APA, 2013). Presentation

of these symptoms occur for two or more years and are typically interrupted by periods of

normal moods. While only a small percentage of the population develops cyclothymic disorder,

it can eventually progress into Bipolar I or bipolar II disorder (Zeschel et al., 2015).




   You should have learned the following in this section:
       •   An individual is diagnosed with Bipolar I disorder if they have ever
           experienced a manic episode and are diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder if the
           criteria has only been met for a hypomanic episode.
       •   A manic episode is characterized by a specific period of time in which an
           individual reports abnormal, persistent, or expansive irritable mood for nearly
           all day, every day, for at least one week.
       •   A hypomanic episode is characterized by abnormally and persistently elevated,
           expansive, or irritable mood and energy levels, though not as extreme as in
           mania, and must be present for at least four days.
       •   Cyclothymic disorder experience periods of hypomanic and mild depressive
           symptoms without meeting the criteria for a depressive episode which lasts
           two or more years and is interrupted by periods of normal moods.

                                       4.3. Epidemiology



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the epidemiology of depressive disorders.

       •   Describe the epidemiology of bipolar disorders.

       •   Describe the epidemiology of suicidality.



4.3.1. Depressive Disorders

       According to the DSM-5 (APA, 2013), the prevalence rate for major depression is

approximately 7% within the United States. The prevalence rate for persistent depressive

disorder is much lower, with a 0.5% rate among adults in the United States. There is a difference

among demographics, with individuals in the 18- to 29- year-old age bracket reporting the

highest rates of depression than any other age group. Similarly, depression is approximately 1.5

to 3 times higher in females than males. The estimated lifetime prevalence for major depressive

disorder in women is 21.3% compared to 12.7% in men (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2001).



4.3.2. Bipolar Disorders

       Compared to depression, the epidemiological studies on the rates of Bipolar Disorder

suggest a significantly lower prevalence rate for both bipolar I and bipolar II. Within the two

disorders, there is a very minimal difference in the prevalence rates with yearly rates reported as

0.6% and 0.8% in the United States for bipolar I and bipolar II, respectively (APA, 2013). As for

gender differences, there are no apparent differences in the frequency of men and women

diagnosed with bipolar I; however, bipolar II appears to be more common in women, with
                                               4-11
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


approximately 80-90% of individuals with rapid-cycling episodes being women (Bauer &

Pfenning, 2005). Women are also more likely to experience rapid cycling between

manic/hypomanic episodes and depressive episodes.



4.3.3. Suicidality

       Suicidality in depressive disorders, particularly bipolar disorder, is much higher than the

general public. In depressive disorders, males and those with a history of suicide attempts/threats

are most at risk for attempting suicide. Individuals with bipolar disorder are approximately 15

times more likely than the general population to attempt suicide. The prevalence rate of suicide

attempts in bipolar patients is estimated to be 33%. Furthermore, bipolar disorder may account

for one-quarter of all completed suicides (APA, 2013).



  You should have learned the following in this section:
      •   Depressive disorders are experienced by about 7% of the population in the United
          States, afflicting young adults and women the most.
      •   Bipolar disorder afflicts less than 1% of the US population and Bipolar II is more
          common in women.
      •   Rates of suicide are greater in individuals with depressive disorders, particularly
          bipolar disorder.

Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the comorbidity of depressive disorders.

       •   Describe the comorbidity of bipolar disorders.



4.4.1. Depressive Disorders

       Studies exploring depression symptoms among the general population show a substantial

pattern of comorbidity between depression and other mental disorders, particularly substance use

disorders (Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2003). Nearly three-fourths of participants with lifetime

MDD in a large-scale research study also met the criteria for at least one other DSM disorder

(Kessler, Berglund, et al., 2003). Among those that are the most common are anxiety disorders,

ADHD, and substance abuse.

       Given the extent of comorbidity among individuals with MDD, researchers have tried to

identify which disorder precipitated the other. The majority of studies have identified most

depression cases occur secondary to another mental health disorder, meaning that the onset of

depression is a direct result of the onset of another disorder (Gotlib & Hammen, 2009).



4.4.2. Bipolar Disorders

       Bipolar disorder also has a high comorbidity rate with other mental disorders, particularly

anxiety disorders, and disruptive/impulse-control disorders such as ADHD and Conduct

Disorder. Substance abuse disorders are also commonly seen in individuals with Bipolar

Disorder. Over half of those with Bipolar Disorder also meet diagnostic criteria for Substance

Abuse Disorder, particularly alcohol abuse. The combination of Bipolar Disorder and Substance

Abuse Disorder places individuals at a greater risk of suicide attempt (APA, 2013). While these

comorbidities are high across both Bipolar I and Bipolar II, type II appears to have more

comorbidities, with 60% of individuals meeting criteria for three or more co-occurring mental

disorders (APA, 2013).




    You should have learned the following in this section:
       •   Depressive disorders have a high comorbidity with substance use disorders,
           anxiety disorders, ADHD, and substance abuse with these other disorders often
           causing the depression.
       •    Bipolar disorder has a high comorbidity with anxiety disorders,
           disruptive/impulse-control disorders, and substance abuse disorders.

       •   Describe the behavioral causes of mood disorders.

       •   Describe the sociocultural causes of mood disorders.



4.5.1. Biological

       Research throughout the years continues to provide evidence that depressive disorders

have some biological cause. While it does not explain every depressive case, it is safe to say that

some individuals may at least have a predisposition to developing a depressive disorder. Among

the biological factors are genetic factors, biochemical factors, and brain structure.

       4.5.1.1. Genetics. Like with any disorder, researchers often explore the prevalence rate of

depressive disorders among family members to determine if there is some genetic component,

whether it be a direct link or a predisposition. If there is a genetic predisposition to developing

depressive disorders, one would expect a higher rate of depression within families than that of

the general population. Research supports this with regards to depressive disorders as there is

nearly a 30% increase in relatives diagnosed with depression compared to 10% of the general

population (Levinson & Nichols, 2014). Similarly, there is an elevated prevalence among first-

degree relatives for both Bipolar I and Bipolar II disorders as well.

       Another way to study the genetic component of a disorder is via twin studies. One would

expect identical twins to have a higher rate of the disorder as opposed to fraternal twins, as
                                                4-15
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


identical twins share the same genetic make-up, whereas fraternal twins only share roughly 50%,

similar to that of siblings. A large-scale study found that if one identical twin was diagnosed with

depression, there was a 46% chance their identical twin was diagnosed with depression. In

contrast, the rate of a depression diagnosis in fraternal twins was only 20%. Despite the fraternal

twin rate still being higher than that of a first-degree relative, this study provided enough

evidence that there is a strong genetic link in the development of depression (McGuffin et al.,

1996).

         More recently, scientists have been studying depression at a molecular level, exploring

possibilities of gene abnormalities as a cause for developing a depressive disorder. While much

of the research is speculation due to sampling issues and low power, there is some evidence that

depression may be tied to the 5-HTT gene on chromosome 17, as this is responsible for the

activity of serotonin (Jansen et al., 2016).

         Bipolar disorders share a similar genetic predisposition to that of major depressive

disorder. Twin studies within bipolar disorder yielded concordance rates for identical twins at as

high as 72%, yet the range for fraternal twins, siblings, and other close relatives ranged from 5-

15%. It is important to note that both of these percentages are significantly higher than that of the

general population, suggesting a strong genetic component within bipolar disorder (Edvardsen et

al., 2008).

         4.5.1.2. Biochemical. As you will read in the treatment section, there is strong evidence

of a biochemical deficit in depression and bipolar disorders. More specifically, low activity

levels of norepinephrine and serotonin, have long been documented as contributing factors to

developing depressive disorders. This relationship was discovered accidentally in the 1950s

when MAOIs were given to tuberculosis patients, and miraculously, their depressive moods were

                                                4-16
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


also improved. Soon thereafter, medical providers found that medications used to treat high

blood pressure by causing a reduction in norepinephrine also caused depression in their patients

(Ayd, 1956).

       While these initial findings were premature in the identification of how neurotransmitters

affected the development of depressive features, they did provide insight as to what

neurotransmitters were involved in this system. Researchers are still trying to determine exact

pathways; however, it does appear that both norepinephrine and serotonin are involved in the

development of symptoms, whether it be between the interaction between them, or their

interaction on other neurotransmitters (Ding et al., 2014).

       Due to the close nature of depression and bipolar disorder, researchers initially believed

that both norepinephrine and serotonin were implicated in the development of bipolar disorder;

however, the idea was that there was a drastic increase in serotonin during mania episodes.

Unfortunately, research supports the opposite. It is believed that low levels of serotonin and high

levels of norepinephrine may explain mania episodes (Soreff & McInnes, 2014). Despite these

findings, additional research with this area is needed to conclusively determine what is

responsible for the manic episodes within bipolar disorder.

       4.5.1.3. Endocrine system. As you may know, the endocrine system is a collection of

glands responsible for regulating hormones, metabolism, growth and development, sleep, and

mood, among other things. Some research has implicated hormones, particularly cortisol, a

hormone released as a stress response, in the development of depression (Owens et al., 2014).

Additionally, melatonin, a hormone released when it is dark outside to assist with the transition

to sleep, may also be related to depressive symptoms, particularly during the winter months.

       4.5.1.4. Brain anatomy. Seeing as neurotransmitters have been implicated in the

development of depressive disorders, it should not be a surprise that various brain structures have

also been identified as contributors to mood disorders. While exact anatomy and pathways are

yet to be determined, research studies implicate the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and

the amygdala. More specifically, drastic changes in blood flow throughout the prefrontal cortex

have been linked with depressive symptoms. Similarly, a smaller hippocampus, and

consequently, fewer neurons, has also been linked to depressive symptoms. Finally, heightened

activity and blood flow in the amygdala, the brain area responsible for our fight or flight

emotions, is also consistently found in individuals with depressive symptoms.

       Abnormalities to several brain structures has also been identified in individuals with

bipolar disorder; however, what or why these structures are abnormal has yet to be determined.

Researchers continue to focus on areas of the basal ganglia and cerebellum, which appear to be

much smaller in individuals with bipolar disorder compared to the general public. Additionally,

there appears to be a decrease in brain activity in regions associated with regulating emotions, as

well as an increase in brain activity among structures related to emotional responsiveness

(Houenou et al., 2011). Additional research is still needed to determine precisely how each of

these brain structures may be implicated in the development of bipolar disorder.



4.5.2. Cognitive

       The cognitive model, arguably the most conclusive model with regards to depressive

disorders, focuses on the negative thoughts and perceptions of an individual. One theory often

equated with the cognitive model of depression is learned helplessness. Coined by Martin

Seligman (1975), learned helplessness was developed based on his laboratory experiment

                                               4-18
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


involving dogs. In this study, Seligman restrained dogs in an apparatus and routinely shocked

them regardless of their behavior. The following day, the dogs were placed in a similar

apparatus; however, this time they were not restrained and there was a small barrier placed

between the “shock” floor and the “safe” floor. What Seligman observed was that despite the

opportunity to escape the shock, the dogs flurried for a bit, and then ultimately laid down and

whimpered while being shocked.

       Based on this study, Seligman concluded that the animals essentially learned that they

were unable to avoid the shock the day prior, and therefore, learned that they were helpless in

preventing the shocks. When they were placed in a similar environment but had the opportunity

to escape the shock, their learned helplessness carried over, and they continued to believe they

were unable to escape the shock.

       This study has been linked to humans through research on attributional style (Nolen-

Hoeksema, Girgus & Seligman, 1992). There are two types of attributional styles—positive and

negative. A negative attributional style focuses on the internal, stable, and global influence of

daily lives, whereas a positive attributional style focuses on the external, unstable, and specific

influence of the environment. Research has found that individuals with a negative attributional

style are more likely to experience depression. This is likely due to their negative interpretation

of daily events. For example, if something bad were to happen to them, they would conclude that

it is their fault (internal), bad things always happen to them (stable), and bad things happen all

day to them. Unfortunately, this maladaptive thinking style often takes over an individual’s daily

view, thus making them more vulnerable to depression.

       In addition to attributional style, Aaron Beck also attributed negative thinking as a

precursor to depressive disorders (Beck, 2002, 1991, 1967). Often viewed as the grandfather of

                                                4-19
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Beck went on to coin the terms—maladaptive attitudes, cognitive

triad, errors in thinking, and automatic thoughts—all of which combine to explain the cognitive

model of depressive disorders.

       Maladaptive attitudes, or negative attitudes about oneself, others, and the world around

them are often present in those with depressive symptoms. These attitudes are inaccurate and

often global. For example, “If I fail my exam, the world will know I’m stupid.” Will the entire

world really know you failed your exam? Not likely. Because you fail the exam, are you stupid?

No. Individuals with depressive symptoms often develop these maladaptive attitudes regarding

everything in their life, indirectly isolating themselves from others. The cognitive triad also

plays into the maladaptive attitudes in that the individual interprets these negative thoughts about

their experiences, themselves, and their futures.

       Cognitive distortions, also known as errors in thinking, are a key component in Beck’s

cognitive theory. Beck identified 15 errors in thinking that are most common in individuals with

depression (see the end of the module). Among the most common are catastrophizing, jumping

to conclusions, and overgeneralization. I always like to use my dad as an example for

overgeneralization. Whenever we go to the grocery store, he always comments about how

whatever line he chooses, at every store, it is always the slowest line. Does this happen every

time he is at the store? I’m doubtful, but his error in thinking leads to him believing this is true.

       Finally, automatic thoughts, or the constant stream of negative thoughts, also leads to

symptoms of depression as individuals begin to feel as though they are inadequate or helpless in

a given situation. While some cognitions are manipulated and interpreted negatively, Beck stated

that there is another set of negative thoughts that occur automatically. Research studies have

continually supported Beck’s maladaptive thoughts, attitudes, and errors in thinking as

                                                 4-20
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


fundamental issues in those with depressive disorders (Lai et al., 2014; Possel & Black, 2014).

Furthermore, as you will see in the treatment section, cognitive strategies are among the most

effective forms of treatment for depressive disorders.



4.5.3. Behavioral

       The behavioral model explains depression as a result of a change in the number of

rewards and punishments one receives throughout their life. This change can come from work,

intimate relationships, family, or even the environment in general. Among the most influential in

the field of depression is Peter Lewinsohn. He stated depression occurred in most people due to

the reduced positive rewards in their life. Because they were not positively rewarded, their

constructive behaviors occurred more infrequently until they stop engaging in the behavior

completely (Lewinsohn et al., 1990; 1984). An example of this is a student who keeps receiving

bad grades on their exam despite studying for hours. Over time, the individual will reduce the

amount of time they are studying, thus continuing to earn poor grades.



4.5.4. Sociocultural

       In the sociocultural theory, the role of family and one’s social environment play a

substantial role in the development of depressive disorders. There are two sociocultural views-

the family-social perspective and the multi-cultural perspective.

       4.5.4.1. Family-social perspective. Similar to that of the behavioral theory, the family-

social perspective of depression suggests that depression is related to the unavailability of social

support. This is often supported by research studies that show separated and divorced individuals

are three times more likely to experience depressive symptoms than those that are married or

                                                4-21
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


even widowed (Schultz, 2007). While many factors lead a couple to separate or end their

marriage, some relationships end due to a spouse’s mental health issues, particularly depressive

symptoms. Depressive symptoms have been positively related to increased interpersonal

conflicts, reduced communication, and intimacy issues, all of which are often reported in causal

factors leading to a divorce (Najman et al., 2014).

       The family-social perspective can also be viewed oppositely, with stress and marital

discord leading to increased rates of depression in one or both spouses (Nezlek et al., 2000).

While some research indicates that having children provides a positive influence in one’s life, it

can also lead to stress both within the individual, as well as between partners due to division of

work and discipline differences. Studies have shown that women who had three or more young

children, and also lacked a close confidante and outside employment, were more likely than

other mothers to become depressed (Brown, 2002).

       4.5.4.2. Multi-cultural perspective. While depression is experienced across the entire

world, one’s cultural background may influence what symptoms of depression are presented.

Common depressive symptoms such as feeling sad, lack of energy, anhedonia, difficulty

concentrating, and thoughts of suicide are a hallmark in most societies; other symptoms may be

more specific to one’s nationality. More specifically, individuals from non-Western countries

(China and other Asian countries) often focus on the physical symptoms of depression—

tiredness, weakness, sleep issues—and less of an emphasis on the cognitive symptoms.

Individuals from Latino and Mediterranean cultures often experience problems with “nerves”

and headaches as primary symptoms of depression (APA, 2013).

       Within the United States, many researchers have explored potential differences across

ethnic or racial groups in both rates of depression, as well as presenting symptoms of those

                                               4-22
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


diagnosed with depression. These studies continually fail to identify any significant differences

between ethnic and racial groups; however, one major study has identified a difference in the rate

of recurrence of depression in Hispanic and African Americans (Gonzalez et al., 2010). While

the exact reason for this is unclear, researchers propose a lack of treatment opportunities as a

possible explanation. According to Gonzalez and colleagues (2010), approximately 54% of

depressed white Americans seek out treatment, compared to the 34% and 40% Hispanic and

African Americans, respectively. The fact that there is a large discrepancy in the use of treatment

between white Americans and minority Americans suggests that these individuals are not

receiving the effective treatment necessary to resolve the disorder, thus leaving them more

vulnerable for repeated depressive episodes.

       4.5.4.3. Gender differences. As previously discussed, there is a significant difference

between gender and rates of depression, with women twice as likely to experience an episode of

depression than men (Schuch et al., 2014). There are a few speculations as to why there is such

an imbalance in the rate of depression across genders.

       The first theory, artifact theory, suggests that the difference between genders is due to

clinician or diagnostic systems being more sensitive to diagnosing women with depression than

men. While women are often thought to be more “emotional,” easily expressing their feelings

and more willing to discuss their symptoms with clinicians and physicians, men often withhold

their symptoms or will present with more traditionally “masculine” symptoms of anger or

aggression. While this theory is a possible explanation for the gender differences in the rate of

depression, research has failed to support this theory, suggesting that men and women are

equally likely to seek out treatment and discuss their depressive symptoms (McSweeney, 2004;

Rieker & Bird, 2005).

                                                4-23
                                                                    2nd edition as of August 2020


       The second theory, hormone theory, suggests that variations in hormone levels trigger

depression in women more than men (Graziottin & Serafini, 2009). While there is biological

evidence supporting the changes in hormone levels during various phases of the menstrual cycle

and their impact on women’s ability to integrate and process emotional information, research

fails to support this theory as the reason for higher rates of depression in women (Whiffen &

Demidenko, 2006).

       The third theory, life stress theory, suggests that women are more likely to experience

chronic stressors than men, thus accounting for their higher rate of depression (Astbury, 2010).

Women face increased risk for poverty, lower employment opportunities, discrimination, and

poorer quality of housing than men, all of which are strong predictors of depressive symptoms

(Garcia-Toro et al., 2013).

       The fourth theory, gender roles theory, suggests that social and or psychological factors

related to traditional gender roles also influence the rate of depression in women. For example,

men are often encouraged to develop personal autonomy, seek out activities that interest them,

and display achievement-oriented goals; women are encouraged to empathize and care for

others, often fostering an interdependent functioning, which may cause women to value the

opinion of others more highly than their male counterparts do.

       The final theory, rumination theory, suggests that women are more likely than men to

ruminate, or intently focus, on their depressive symptoms, thus making them more vulnerable to

developing depression at a clinical level (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2012). Several studies have

supported this theory and shown that rumination of negative thoughts is positively related to an

increase in depression symptoms (Hankin, 2009).

       While many theories try to explain the gender discrepancy in depressive episodes, no

single theory has produced enough evidence to fully explain why women experience depression

more than men. Due to the lack of evidence, gender differences in depression remains one of the

most researched topics within the subject of depression, while simultaneously being the least

understood phenomena within clinical psychology.

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   In terms of biological explanations for depressive disorders, there is evidence
       that rates of depression are higher among identical twins (the same is true for
       bipolar disorders), that the 5-HTT gene on chromosome 17 may be involved in
       depressive disorders, that norepinephrine and serotonin affect depressive (both
       being low) and bipolar disorders (low serotonin and high norepinephrine), the
       hormones cortisol and melatonin affect depression, and several brain
       structures are implicated in depression (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and
       amygdala) and bipolar disorder (basal ganglia and cerebellum).
   •   In terms of cognitive explanations, learned helplessness, attributional style,
       and maladaptive attitudes to include the cognitive triad, errors in thinking, and
       automatic thoughts, help to explain depressive disorders.
   •   Behavioral explanations center on changes in the rewards and punishments
       received throughout life.
   •   Sociocultural explanations include the family-social perspective and multi-
       cultural perspective.
   •   Women are twice as likely to experience depression and this could be due to
       women being more likely to be diagnosed than men (called the artifact theory),
       variations in hormone levels in women (hormone theory), women being more
       likely to experience chronic stressors (life stress theory), the fostering of an
       interdependent functioning in women (gender roles theory), and that women
       are more likely to intently focus on their symptoms (rumination theory).

4.6.1. Depressive Disorders

         Given that Major Depressive Disorder is among the most frequent and debilitating

psychiatric disorders, it should not be surprising that the research on this disorder is quite

extensive. Among its treatment options, the most efficacious treatments include antidepressant

medications, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT; Beck et al., 1979), Behavioral Activation

(BA; Jacobson et al., 2001), and Interpersonal Therapy (IPT; Klerman et al., 1984). Although

CBT is the most widely known and used treatment for Major Depressive Disorder, there is

minimal evidence to support one treatment modality over the other; treatment is generally

dictated by therapist competence, availability, and patient preference (Craighhead & Dunlop,

2014).

         4.6.1.1. Psychopharmacology - Antidepressant medications. Antidepressants are often

the most common first-line attempt at treatment for MDD for a few reasons. Oftentimes an

individual will present with symptoms to their primary caregiver (a medical doctor) who will

prescribe them some line of antidepressant medication. Medication is often seen as an “easier”

treatment for depression as the individual can take the medication at their home, rather than

attending weekly therapy sessions; however, this also leaves room for adherence issues as a large

percentage of individuals fail to take prescription medication as indicated by their physician.

Given the biological functions of neurotransmitters and their involvement in maintaining

depressive symptoms, it makes sense that this is an effective type of treatment.

Within antidepressant medications, there are a few different classes, each categorized by their

structural or functional relationships. It should be noted that no specific antidepressant

medication class or medication have been proven to be more effective in treating MDD than

others (APA, 2010). In fact, many patients may try several different types of antidepressant

medications until they find one that is effective, with minimal side effects.

       4.6.1.2. Psychopharmacology - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

SSRIs are among the most common medications used to treat depression due to their relatively

benign side effects. Additionally, the required dose to reach therapeutic levels is low compared

to the other medication options. Possible side effects from SSRIs include but are not limited to

nausea, insomnia, and reduced sex drive.

       SSRIs improve depression symptoms by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine and/or

serotonin in presynaptic neurons, thus allowing more of these neurotransmitters to be available

for postsynaptic neurons. While this is the general mechanism through which all SSRI’s work,

there are minor biological differences among different types of medications within the SSRI

family. These small differences are actually beneficial to patients in that there are a few

treatment options to maximize medication benefits and minimize side effects.

       4.6.1.3. Psychopharmacology - Tricyclic antidepressants. Although originally

developed to treat schizophrenia, tricyclic antidepressants were adapted to treat depression after



                                                4-28
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


failing to manage symptoms of schizophrenia (Kuhn, 1958). The term tricyclic came from the

molecular shape of the structure: three rings.

       Tricyclic antidepressants are similar to SSRIs in that they work by affecting brain

chemistry, altering the number of neurotransmitters available for neurons. More specifically,

they block the absorption or reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, thus increasing their

availability for postsynaptic neurons. While effective, tricyclic antidepressants have been

increasingly replaced by SSRIs due to their reduced side effects. However, tricyclic

antidepressants have been shown to be more effective in treating depressive symptoms in

individuals who have not been able to achieve symptom reduction via other pharmacological

approaches.

       While the majority of the side effects are minimal- dry mouth, blurry vision, constipation,

others can be serious- sexual dysfunction, tachycardia, cognitive and/or memory impairment, to

name a few. Due to the potential impact on the heart, tricyclic antidepressants should not be used

in cardiac patients as they may exacerbate cardiac arrhythmias (Roose & Spatz, 1999).

       4.6.1.4. Psychopharmacology - Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). The use of

MAOIs as a treatment for depression began serendipitously as patients in the early 1950s

reported reduced depression symptoms while on the medication to treat tuberculosis. Research

studies confirmed that MAOIs were effective in treating depression in adults outside the

treatment of tuberculosis. Although still prescribed, they are not typically first-line medications

due to their safety concerns with hypertensive crises. Because of this, individuals on MAOIs

have strict diet restrictions to reduce their risk of hypertensive crises (Shulman, Herrman &

Walker, 2013).



                                                 4-29
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


       How do MAOIs work? In basic terms, monoamine oxidase is released in the brain to

remove excess neurotransmitters norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. MAOIs essentially

prevent the monoamine oxidase (hence the name monoamine oxidase inhibitors) from removing

these neurotransmitters, thus resulting in an increase in these brain chemicals (Shulman, Herman

& Walker, 2013). As previously discussed, norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine are all

involved in the biological mechanisms of maintaining depressive symptoms.

       While these drugs are effective, they come with serious side effects. In addition to the

hypertensive episodes, they can also cause nausea, headaches, drowsiness, involuntary muscle

jerks, reduced sexual desire, weight gain, etc. (APA, 2010). Despite these side effects, studies

have shown that individuals prescribed MAOIs for depression have a treatment response rate of

50-70% (Krishnan, 2007). Overall, despite their effectiveness, MAOIs are likely the best

treatment for late-stage, treatment-resistant depression patients who have exhausted other

treatment options (Krishnan, 2007).

       It should be noted that occasionally, antipsychotic medications are used for individuals

with MDD; however, these are limited to individuals presenting with psychotic features.

       4.6.1.5. Psychotherapy - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT was founded by

Aaron Beck in the 1960s and is a widely practiced therapeutic tool used to treat depression (and

other disorders as well). The basics of CBT involve what Beck called the cognitive triad—

cognitions (thoughts), behaviors, and emotions. Beck believed that these three components are

interconnected, and therefore, affect one another. It is believed that CBT can improve emotions

in depressed patients by changing both cognitions (thoughts) and behaviors, which in return

enhances mood. Common cognitive interventions with CBT include thought monitoring and

recording, identifying cognitive errors, examining evidence supporting/negating cognitions, and

                                               4-30
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


creating rational alternatives to maladaptive thought patterns. Behavioral interventions of CBT

include activity planning, pleasant event scheduling, task assignments, and coping-skills training.

CBT generally follows four phases of treatment:

       •   Phase 1: Increasing pleasurable activities. Similar to behavioral activation (see

           below), the clinician encourages the patient to identify and engage in activities that

           are pleasurable to the individual. The clinician can help the patient to select the

           activity, as well as help them plan when they will engage in that activity.

       •   Phase 2: Challenging automatic thoughts. During this stage, the clinician provides

           psychoeducation about the negative automatic thoughts that can maintain depressive

           symptoms. The patient will learn to identify these thoughts on their own during the

           week and maintain a thought journal of these cognitions to review with the clinician

           in session.

       •   Phase 3: Identifying negative thoughts. Once the individual is consistently able to

           identify these negative thoughts on a daily basis, the clinician can help the patient

           identify how these thoughts are maintaining their depressive symptoms. It is at this

           point that the patient begins to have direct insight as to how their cognitions

           contribute to their disorder.

       •   Phase 4: Changing thoughts. The final stage of treatment involves challenging the

           negative thoughts the patient has been identifying in the last two phases of treatment

           and replacing them with positive thoughts.

       4.6.1.6. Psychotherapy - Behavioral activation (BA). BA is similar to the behavioral

component of CBT in that the goal of treatment is to alleviate depression and prevent future

relapse by changing an individual’s behavior. Founded by Ferster (1973), as well as Lewinsohn

                                               4-31
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


and colleagues (Lewinsohn, 1974; Lewinsohn, Biglan, & Zeiss, 1976), the goal of BA is to

increase the frequency of behaviors so that individuals have opportunities to experience greater

contact with sources of reward in their lives. To do this, the clinician assists the patient by

developing a list of pleasurable activities that they can engage in outside of treatment (i.e., going

for a walk, going shopping, having dinner with a friend). Additionally, the clinician assists the

patient in identifying their negative behaviors—crying, sleeping in, avoiding friends—and

monitoring them so that they do not impact the outcome of their pleasurable activities. Finally,

the clinician works with the patient on effective social skills. By minimizing negative behaviors

and maximizing pleasurable activities, the individual will receive more positive reward and

reinforcement from others and their environment, thus improving their overall mood.

       4.6.1.7. Psychotherapy - Interpersonal therapy (IPT). IPT was developed by Klerman,

Weissman, and colleagues in the 1970s as a treatment arm for a pharmacotherapy study of

depression (Weissman, 1995). The treatment was created based on data from post-World War II

individuals who expressed a substantial impact on their psychosocial life events. Klerman and

colleagues noticed a significant relationship between the development of depression and

complicated bereavement, role disputes, role transitions, and interpersonal deficits in these

individuals (Weissman, 1995). The idea behind IPT is that depressive episodes compromise

interpersonal functioning, which makes it difficult to manage stressful life events. The basic

mechanism of IPT is to establish effective strategies to manage interpersonal issues, which in

return, will ameliorate depressive symptoms.

       There are two main principles of IPT. First, depression is a common medical illness with

a complex and multi-determined etiology. Since depression is a medical illness, it is also

treatable and not the patient’s fault. Second, depression is connected to a current or recent life

                                                 4-32
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


event. The goal of IPT is to identify the interpersonal problem that is related to the depressive

symptoms and solve this crisis so the patient can improve their life situation while relieving

depressive symptoms.

       4.6.1.8. Multimodal treatment. While both pharmacological and psychological

treatment alone is very effective in treating depression, a combination of the two treatments may

offer additional benefits, particularly in the maintenance of wellness. Additionally, multimodal

treatment options may be helpful for individuals who have not achieved wellness in a single

modality.

       Multimodal treatments can be offered in three different ways: concurrently, sequentially,

or within a stepped manner (McGorry et al., 2010). With a stepped manner treatment,

pharmacological therapy is often used initially to treat depressive symptoms. Once the patient

reports some relief in symptoms, the psychosocial treatment is added to address the remaining

symptoms. While all three methods are effective in managing depressive symptoms, matching

patients to their treatment preferences may produce better outcomes than clinician-driven

treatment decisions.



4.6.2. Bipolar Disorder

       4.6.2.1. Psychopharmacology. Unlike treatment for MDD, there is some controversy

regarding effective treatment of Bipolar Disorder. One suggestion is to treat Bipolar Disorder

aggressively with mood stabilizers such as Lithium or Depakote as these medications do not

induce pharmacological mania/hypomania. These mood stabilizers are occasionally combined

with antidepressants later in treatment only if absolutely necessary (Ghaemi, Hsu, Soldani &

Goodwin, 2003). Research has shown that mood stabilizers are less potent in treating depressive

                                                4-33
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


symptoms, and therefore, the combination approach is believed to help manage both the manic

and depressive episodes (Nivoli et al., 2011).

       The other treatment option is to forgo the mood stabilizer and treat symptoms with newer

antidepressants early in treatment. Unfortunately, large scale research studies have not shown

great support for this method (Gijsman, Geddes, Rendell, Nolen, & Goodwin, 2004; Moller,

Grunze & Broich, 2006). Antidepressants often trigger a manic or hypomanic episode in bipolar

patients. Because of this, the first-line treatment option for Bipolar Disorder is mood stabilizers,

particularly Lithium.

       4.6.2.2. Psychological treatment. Although psychopharmacology is the first and most

widely used treatment for bipolar disorders, occasionally psychological interventions are also

paired with medication as psychotherapy alone is not a sufficient treatment option. Majority of

psychological interventions are aimed at medication adherence, as many bipolar patients stop

taking their mood stabilizers when they “feel better” (Advokat et al., 2014). Social skills training

and problem-solving skills are also helpful techniques to address in the therapeutic setting as

individuals with bipolar disorder often struggle in this area.



4.6.3. Outcome of Treatment

       4.6.3.1. Depressive treatment. As we have discussed, major depressive disorder has a

variety of treatment options, all found to be efficacious. However, research suggests that while

psychopharmacological interventions are more effective in rapidly reducing symptoms,

psychotherapy, or even a combined treatment approach, are more effective in establishing long-

term relief of symptoms.



                                                 4-34

        Rates of relapse for major depressive disorder are often associated with individuals

whose onset was at a younger age (particularly adolescents), those who have already experienced

multiple major depressive episodes, and those with more severe symptomology, especially those

presenting with severe suicidal ideation and psychotic features (APA, 2013).

        4.6.3.2. Bipolar treatment. Lithium and other mood stabilizers are very effective in

managing symptoms of patients with bipolar disorder. Unfortunately, it is the adherence to the

medication regimen that is often the issue with these patients. Bipolar patients often desire the

euphoric highs that are associated with manic and hypomanic episodes, leading them to forgo

their medication. A combination of psychopharmacology and psychotherapy aimed at increasing

the rate of adherence to medical treatment may be the most effective treatment option for bipolar

I and II disorder.

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   Treatment of depressive disorders include psychopharmacological options
       such as anti-depressant mediations, SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and
       MAOIs AND/OR psychotherapy options to include CBT, behavioral
       activation (BA), and interpersonal therapy (IPT). A combination of the two
       main approaches often works best, especially in relation to maintenance of
       wellness.
   •   Treatment of bipolar disorder involves mood stabilizers such as Lithium and
       psychological interventions with the goal of medication adherence, as well as
       social skills training and problem-solving skills.
   •   In regard to depression, psychopharmacological interventions are more
       effective in rapidly reducing symptoms, while psychotherapy, or even a
       combined treatment approach, is more effective in establishing long-term
       relief of symptoms.
   •   A combination of psychopharmacology and psychotherapy aimed at
       increasing the rate of adherence to medical treatment may be the most
       effective treatment option for bipolar I and II disorder.

                                          5.1. Stressors



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Define stressor.

       •   Identify and describe common stressors.



       Before we dive into clinical presentations for the three most common trauma and stress-

related disorders, let’s discuss common events that precipitate a stress-related diagnosis. A stress

disorder occurs when an individual has difficulty coping with or adjusting to a recent stressor.

Stressors can be any event—either witnessed firsthand, experienced personally, or experienced

by a close family member—that increases physical or psychological demands on an individual.

These events are significant enough that they pose a threat, whether real or imagined, to the

individual. While many people experience similar stressors throughout their lives, only a small

percentage of individuals experience significant maladjustment to the event that psychological

intervention is warranted.

       Among the most commonly studied triggers for trauma-related disorders are combat and

physical/sexual assault. Symptoms of combat-related trauma date back to World War I when

soldiers would return home with “shell shock” (Figley, 1978). Unfortunately, it wasn’t until after
                                                5-3
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


the Vietnam War that significant progress was made in both identifying and treating war-related

psychological difficulties (Roy-Byrne et al., 2004). With the more recent wars in Iraq and

Afghanistan, attention was again brought to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms

due to the large number of service members returning from deployments and reporting

significant trauma symptoms.

       Physical assault, and more specifically sexual assault, is another commonly studied

traumatic event. Rape, or forced sexual intercourse or other sexual act committed without an

individual’s consent, occurs in one out of every five women and one in every 71 men (Black et

al., 2011). Unfortunately, this statistic likely underestimates the actual number of cases that

occur due to the reluctance of many individuals to report their sexual assault. Of the reported

cases, it is estimated that nearly 81% of female and 35% of male rape victims report both acute

stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (Black et al., 2011).

       Now that we’ve discussed a little about some of the most commonly studied traumatic

events, let’s take a look at the presentation for posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder,

and adjustment disorder.

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   A stressor is any event that increases physical or psychological demands on
       an individual.
   •   It does not have to be personally experienced but can be witnessed or occur to
       a close family member and have the same effect.
   •   Only a small percentage of people experience significant maladjustment due
       to these events.
   •   The most studied triggers for trauma-related disorders include physical/sexual
       assault and combat.

Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe how PTSD presents itself.

       •   Describe how acute stress disorder presents itself.

       •   Describe how adjustment disorder presents itself.



5.2.1. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder

       Posttraumatic stress disorder, or more commonly known as PTSD, is identified by the

development of physiological, psychological, and emotional symptoms following exposure to a

traumatic event. Individuals must have been exposed to a situation where actual or threatened

death occurred. Examples of these situations include but are not limited to: witnessing a

traumatic event as it occurred to someone else; learning about a traumatic event that occurred to

a family member or close friend; or being exposed to repeated events where one experiences an

aversive event (e.g., victims of child abuse/neglect, ER physicians in trauma centers, etc.). It is

important to understand that while the presentation of these symptoms varies among individuals,

to meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, individuals need to report symptoms among the four

different categories of symptoms.

       The first category involves recurrent experiences of the traumatic event, which can occur

via flashbacks, distinct memories (which may be voluntary or involuntary), or even distressing

dreams. These recurrent experiences must be specific to the traumatic event or the moments

immediately following to meet the criteria for PTSD. Regardless of the method, the recurrent

experiences can last several seconds or extend for several days. They are often initiated by
                                                5-6
                                                                         2nd edition as of August 2020


physical sensations similar to those experienced during the traumatic events or environmental

triggers such as a specific location. Because of these triggers, individuals with PTSD are known

to avoid stimuli (i.e., activities, objects, people, etc.) associated with the traumatic event.

        The second category involves avoidance of stimuli related to the traumatic event.

Individuals with PTSD may be observed trying to avoid the distressing thoughts and/or feelings

related to the memories of the traumatic event. One way individuals will avoid these memories is

by avoiding physical stimuli such as locations, individuals, activities, or even specific situations

that trigger the memory of the traumatic event.

        The third category experienced by individuals with PTSD is negative alterations in

cognition or mood. This is often reported as difficulty remembering an important aspect of the

traumatic event. It should be noted that this amnesia is not due to a head injury, loss of

consciousness, or substances, but rather, due to the traumatic nature of the event. The impaired

memory may also lead individuals to have false beliefs about the causes of the traumatic event,

often blaming themselves or others. An overall persistent negative state, including a generalized

negative belief about oneself or others is also reported by those with PTSD. Similar to those with

depression, individuals with PTSD may report a reduced interest in participating in previously

enjoyable activities, as well as the desire to engage with others socially.

        The fourth and final category is alterations in arousal and reactivity. Because of the

negative mood and increased irritability, individuals with PTSD may be quick-tempered and act

out aggressively, both verbally and physically. While these aggressive responses may be

provoked, they are also sometimes unprovoked. It is believed these behaviors occur due to the

heightened sensitivity to potential threats, especially if the threat is similar to their traumatic

event. More specifically, individuals with PTSD have a heightened startle response and easily

                                                  5-7

jump or respond to unexpected noises just as a telephone ringing or a car backfiring. Given this

heightened arousal state, it should not be surprising that individuals with PTSD also experience

significant sleep disturbances, with difficulty falling asleep, as well as staying asleep due to

nightmares.

       Although somewhat obvious, these symptoms likely cause significant distress in social,

occupational, and other (i.e., romantic, personal) areas of functioning. Duration of symptoms is

also important, as PTSD cannot be diagnosed unless symptoms have been present for at least

one month. If they have not been present for a month, the individual may meet criteria for Acute

Stress Disorder (see below).



5.2.2. Acute Stress Disorder

       Acute stress disorder is very similar to PTSD except for the fact that symptoms must be

present from 3 days to 1 month following exposure to one or more traumatic events. If the

symptoms are present after one month, the individual would then meet the criteria for PTSD.

Additionally, if symptoms present immediately following the traumatic event but resolve by day

3, an individual would not meet the criteria for acute stress disorder.

       Symptoms of acute stress disorder follow that of PTSD with a few exceptions. PTSD

requires symptoms within each of the four categories discussed above; however, acute stress

disorder requires that the individual experience nine symptoms across five different categories

(intrusion symptoms, negative mood, dissociative symptoms, avoidance symptoms, and arousal

symptoms). For example, an individual may experience several arousal and reactivity symptoms

such as sleep issues, concentration issues, and hypervigilance, but does not experience issues

regarding negative mood. Regardless of the category of the symptoms, so long as nine symptoms

                                                 5-8
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


are present and the symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational,

and other functioning, an individual will meet the criteria for acute stress disorder.



5.2.3. Adjustment Disorder

       Adjustment disorder is the least intense of the three stress-related disorders discussed in

this module. An adjustment disorder occurs following an identifiable stressor that happened

within the past 3 months. This stressor can be a single event (loss of job, death of a family

member) or a series of multiple stressors (cancer treatment, divorce/child custody issues).

Unlike PTSD and acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder does not have a set of specific

symptoms an individual must meet for diagnosis, rather, whatever symptoms the individual is

experiencing must be related to the stressor and must be significant enough to impair social,

occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Bereavement can be diagnosed as an

adjustment disorder in extreme cases where an individual's grief exceeds the intensity or

persistence that is expected.

       It should be noted that there are modifiers associated with adjustment disorder. Due to the

variety of behavioral and emotional symptoms that can be present with an adjustment disorder,

clinicians are expected to classify a patient’s adjustment disorder as one of the following: with

depressed mood, with anxiety, with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, with disturbance of

conduct, with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct, or unspecified if the behaviors do not

meet criteria for one of the aforementioned categories. Based on the individual’s presenting

symptoms, the clinician will determine which category best classifies the patient’s condition.

These modifiers are also important when choosing treatment options for patients.

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   In terms of stress disorders, symptoms lasting over 3 days but not exceeding
       one month, would be classified as acute stress disorder while those lasting over
       a month are typical of PTSD.
   •   If symptoms begin after a traumatic event but resolve themselves within three
       days, the individual does not meet the criteria for a stress disorder.
   •   Symptoms of PTSD fall into four different categories for which an individual
       must have at least one symptom in each category to receive a diagnosis. These
       categories include recurrent experiences, avoidance of stimuli, negative
       alterations in cognition or mood, and alterations in arousal and reactivity.
   •   As for acute stress disorder, to receive a diagnosis an individual must
       experience nine symptoms across five different categories (intrusion
       symptoms, negative mood, dissociative symptoms, avoidance symptoms, and
       arousal symptoms).
   •   Finally, adjustment disorder is the last intense of the three disorders and does
       not have a specific set of symptoms of which an individual has to have some
       number. Whatever symptoms the person presents with, they must cause
       significant impairment in areas of functioning such as social or occupational,
       and several modifiers are associated with the disorder.

                                      5.3. Epidemiology



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the epidemiology of PTSD.

       •   Describe the epidemiology of acute stress disorder.

       •   Describe the epidemiology of adjustment disorders.



5.3.1. PTSD

       The prevalence rate for PTSD in the US is 8.7% (APA, 2013). It should not come as a

surprise that the rates of PTSD are higher among veterans and others who work in fields with

high traumatic experiences (i.e., firefighters, police, EMTs, emergency room providers). In fact,

PTSD rates for combat veterans are estimated to be as high as 30% (NcNally, 2012). Between

one-third and one-half of all PTSD cases consist of rape survivors, military combat and captivity,

and ethically or politically motivated genocide (APA, 2013).

       Concerning gender, PTSD is more prevalent among females than males, likely due to

their higher occurrence of exposure to traumatic experiences such as rape, domestic abuse, and

other forms of interpersonal violence (APA, 2013). Gender differences are not found in

populations where both males and females are exposed to significant stressors suggesting that

both genders are equally predisposed to developing PTSD. Prevalence rates vary slightly across

cultural groups, which may reflect differences in exposure to traumatic events. (Hinton & Lewis-

Fernandez, 2011). More specifically, prevalence rates of PTSD are highest for African

Americans, followed by Latino/Hispanic Americans and European Americans, and lowest for

Asian Americans (Hinton & Lewis-Fernandez, 2011).
                                              5-11
                                                                         2nd edition as of August 2020


5.3.2. Acute Stress Disorder

        The prevalence rate for acute stress disorder varies across the country and by traumatic

event. Accurate prevalence rates for acute stress disorder are difficult to determine as patients

must seek treatment within 30 days of the traumatic event, but it is estimated that anywhere

between 7-30% of individuals experiencing a traumatic event will develop acute stress disorder

(National Center for PTSD). While acute stress disorder is not a good predictor of who will

develop PTSD, approximately 50% of those with acute stress disorder do eventually develop

PTSD (Bryant, 2010; Bryant, Friedman, Speigel, Ursano, & Strain, 2010).

        Similar to PTSD, acute stress disorder is more common in females than males; however,

unlike PTSD, there may be some neurobiological differences in the stress response that

contribute to females developing acute stress disorder more often than males (APA, 2013). With

that said, the increased exposure to traumatic events among females may also be a strong reason

why women are more likely to develop acute stress disorder.



5.3.3. Adjustment Disorder

        Adjustment disorders are relatively common as they describe individuals who are having

difficulty adjusting to life after a significant stressor. In psychiatric hospitals, adjustment

disorders account for roughly 50% of the admissions, ranking number one for the most common

diagnosis (APA, 2013). As for the general public, it is estimated that anywhere from 5-20% of

outpatient referrals are due to an adjustment disorder (APA, 2013).

      You should have learned the following in this section:
           •   Regarding PTSD, rates are highest among people who are likely to be exposed
               to high traumatic events, women, and African Americans.
           •   As for acute stress disorder, prevalence rates are hard to determine since
               patients must seek medical treatment within 30 days, but females are more
               likely to develop the disorder.
           •   Adjustment disorders are relatively common since they occur in individuals
               having trouble adjusting to a significant stressor.

           1. Compare and contrast the prevalence rates among the three trauma and stress-
              related disorders.




                                       5.4. Comorbidity



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the comorbidity of PTSD.

       •   Describe the comorbidity of acute stress disorder.

       •   Describe the comorbidity of adjustment disorder.



5.4.1. PTSD

       Given the traumatic nature of the disorder, it should not be surprising that there is a high

comorbidity rate between PTSD and other psychological disorders. Individuals with PTSD are

80% more likely than those without PTSD to report clinically significant levels of depressive,

bipolar, anxiety, or substance abuse-related symptoms (APA, 2013).



                                               5-13
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


       There is also a strong relationship between PTSD and major neurocognitive disorders,

which may be due to the overlapping symptoms between these disorders (Neurocognitive

Disorders will be covered in Module 14). There has also been an increase in PTSD and traumatic

brain injuries (TBI) due to the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. US military personnel and

combat veterans report a comorbidity rate between PTSD and TBI at nearly 50% (APA, 2013).



5.4.2. Acute Stress Disorder

       Because 30 days after the traumatic event, ASD becomes PTSD (or the symptoms remit),

the comorbidity of ASD with other psychological disorders has not been studied. While ASD

and PTSD cannot be comorbid disorders, several studies have explored the relationship between

ASD and PTSD in efforts to identify individuals most at risk for developing PTSD. Research

studies indicate roughly 80% of motor vehicle accident survivors, as well as assault victims, who

met the criteria for ASD went on to develop PTSD (Brewin, Andrews, Rose, & Kirk, 1999;

Bryant & Harvey, 1998; Harvey & Bryant, 1998). While some researchers indicated ASD is a

good predictor of PTSD, others argue further research between the two and confounding

variables should be further explored to determine more consistent findings.



5.4.3. Adjustment Disorder

       Unlike most of the disorders we have reviewed thus far, adjustment disorders have a high

comorbidity rate with various other medical conditions (APA, 2013). Often following a critical

or terminal medical diagnosis, an individual will meet the criteria for adjustment disorder as they

process the news about their health and the impact their new medical diagnosis will have on their

life. Other psychological disorders are also diagnosed with adjustment disorder; however,

                                               5-14
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


symptoms of adjustment disorder must be met independently of the other psychological

condition (APA, 2013). For example, an individual with adjustment disorder with depressive

features must not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode; otherwise, the diagnosis of

major depression should be made over the adjustment disorder.




    You should have learned the following in this section:
        •   PTSD has a high comorbidity rate with psychological and neurocognitive
            disorders while this rate is hard to establish with acute stress disorder since it
            becomes PTSD after 30 days.
        •   Adjustment disorder has a high comorbidity rate with other medical conditions
            as people process news about their health and what the impact of a new
            medical diagnosis will be on their life.

       •   Describe the cognitive causes of trauma- and stressor-related disorders.

       •   Describe the social causes of trauma- and stressor-related disorders.

       •   Describe the sociocultural causes of trauma- and stressor-related disorders.



5.5.1. Biological

       HPA axis. One theory for the development of trauma and stress-related disorders is the

over-involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA axis is

involved in the fear-producing response, and some speculate that dysfunction within this axis is

to blame for the development of trauma symptoms. Within the brain, the amygdala serves as the

integrative system that inherently elicits the physiological response to a traumatic/stressful

environmental situation. The amygdala sends this response to the HPA axis in an effort to

prepare the body to “fight or flight.” The HPA axis then releases hormones—epinephrine and

cortisol—to help the body to prepare to respond to a dangerous situation (Stahl & Wise, 2008).

While epinephrine is known to cause physiological symptoms such as increased blood pressure,

increased heart rate, increased alertness, and increased muscle tension, to name a few, cortisol is

responsible for returning the body to homeostasis once the dangerous situation is resolved.

Researchers have studied the amygdala and HPA axis in individuals with PTSD, and have

identified heightened amygdala reactivity in stressful situations, as well as excessive

responsiveness to stimuli that is related to one’s specific traumatic event (Sherin & Nemeroff,
                                                5-16
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


2011). Additionally, studies have indicated that individuals with PTSD also show a diminished

fear extinction, suggesting an overall higher level of stress during non-stressful times. These

findings may explain why individuals with PTSD experience an increased startle response and

exaggerated sensitivity to stimuli associated with their trauma (Schmidt, Kaltwasser, & Wotjak,

2013).



5.5.2. Cognitive

         Preexisting conditions of depression or anxiety may predispose an individual to develop

PTSD or other stress disorders. One theory is that these individuals may ruminate or over-

analyze the traumatic event, thus bringing more attention to the traumatic event and leading to

the development of stress-related symptoms. Furthermore, negative cognitive styles or

maladjusted thoughts about themselves and the environment may also contribute to PTSD

symptoms. For example, individuals who identify life events as “out of their control” report more

severe stress symptoms than those who feel as though they have some control over their lives

(Catanesi et al., 2013).



5.5.3. Social

         While this may hold for many psychological disorders, social and family support have

been identified as protective factors for individuals prone to develop PTSD. More specifically,

rape victims who are loved and cared for by their friends and family members as opposed to

being judged for their actions before the rape, report fewer trauma symptoms and faster

psychological improvement (Street et al., 2011).



                                               5-17

5.5.4. Sociocultural

        As was mentioned previously, different ethnicities report different prevalence rates of

PTSD. While this may be due to increased exposure to traumatic events, there is some evidence

to suggest that cultural groups also interpret traumatic events differently, and therefore, may be

more vulnerable to the disorder. Hispanic Americans have routinely been identified as a cultural

group that experiences a higher rate of PTSD. Studies ranging from combat-related PTSD to on-

duty police officer stress, as well as stress from a natural disaster, all identify Hispanic

Americans as the cultural group experiencing the most traumatic symptoms (Kaczkurkin et al.,

2016; Perilla et al., 2002; Pole et al., 2001).

        Women also report a higher incidence of PTSD symptoms than men. Some possible

explanations for this discrepancy are stigmas related to seeking psychological treatment, as well

as a greater risk of exposure to traumatic events that are associated with PTSD (Kubiak, 2006).

Studies exploring rates of PTSD symptoms for military and police veterans have failed to report

a significant gender difference in the diagnosis rate of PTSD suggesting that there is not a

difference in the rate of occurrence of PTSD in males and females in these settings (Maguen,

Luxton, Skopp, & Madden, 2012).

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   In terms of causes for trauma- and stressor-related disorders, an over-
       involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been cited
       as a biological cause, with rumination and negative coping styles or
       maladjusted thoughts emerging as cognitive causes.
   •   Culture may lead to different interpretations of traumatic events thus causing
       higher rates among Hispanic Americans.
   •   Social and family support have been found to be protective factors for
       individuals most likely to develop PTSD.

       •   Describe the treatment approach of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing

           (EMDR).

       •   Describe the use of psychopharmacological treatment.



5.6.1. Psychological Debriefing

       One way to negate the potential development of PTSD symptoms is thorough

psychological debriefing. Psychological debriefing is considered a type of crisis intervention

that requires individuals who have recently experienced a traumatic event to discuss or process

their thoughts and feelings related to the traumatic event, typically within 72 hours of the event

(Kinchin, 2007). While there are a few different methods to a psychological debriefing, they all

follow the same general format:

       1. Identifying the facts (what happened?)

       2. Evaluating the individual’s thoughts and emotional reaction to the events leading up

           to the event, during the event, and then immediately following

       3. Normalizing the individual’s reaction to the event

       4. Discussing how to cope with these thoughts and feelings, as well as creating a

           designated social support system (Kinchin, 2007).
                                               5-20
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


       Throughout the last few decades, there has been a debate on the effectiveness of

psychological debriefing. Those within the field argue that psychological debriefing is not a

means to cure or prevent PTSD, but rather, psychological debriefing is a means to assist

individuals with a faster recovery time posttraumatic event (Kinchin, 2007). Research across a

variety of traumatic events (natural disasters, burns, war) routinely suggests that psychological

debriefing is not helpful in either the reduction of posttraumatic symptoms nor the recovery time

of those with PTSD (Tuckey & Scott, 2014). One theory is these early interventions may

encourage patients to ruminate on their symptoms or the event itself, thus maintaining PTSD

symptoms (McNally, 2004). In efforts to combat these negative findings of psychological

debriefing, there has been a large movement to provide more structure and training for

professionals employing psychological debriefing, thus ensuring that those who are providing

treatment are properly trained to do so.



5.6.2. Exposure Therapy

       While exposure therapy is predominately used in anxiety disorders, it has also shown

great success in treating PTSD-related symptoms as it helps individuals extinguish fears

associated with the traumatic event. There are several different types of exposure techniques—

imaginal, in vivo, and flooding are among the most common types (Cahill, Rothbaum, Resick,

& Follette, 2009).

       In imaginal exposure, the individual mentally re-creates specific details of the traumatic

event. The patient is then asked to repeatedly discuss the event in increasing detail, providing

more information regarding their thoughts and feelings at each step of the event. During in vivo

exposure, the individual is reminded of the traumatic event through the use of videos, images, or

                                               5-21
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


other tangible objects related to the traumatic event that induces a heightened arousal response.

While the patient is re-experiencing cognitions, emotions, and physiological symptoms related to

the traumatic experience, they are encouraged to utilize positive coping strategies, such as

relaxation techniques, to reduce their overall level of anxiety.

       Imaginal exposure and in vivo exposure are generally done in a gradual process, with

imaginal exposure beginning with fewer details of the event, and slowly gaining information

over time. In vivo starts with images or videos that elicit lower levels of anxiety, and then the

patient slowly works their way up a fear hierarchy, until they are able to be exposed to the most

distressing images. Another type of exposure therapy, flooding, involves disregard for the fear

hierarchy, presenting the most distressing memories or images at the beginning of treatment.

While some argue that this is a more effective method, it is also the most distressing and places

patients at risk for dropping out of treatment (Resick, Monson, & Rizvi, 2008).



5.6.3. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

       Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, as discussed in the mood disorders chapter, has been

proven to be an effective form of treatment for trauma/stress-related disorders. It is believed that

this type of treatment is effective in reducing trauma-related symptoms due to its ability to

identify and challenge the negative cognitions surrounding the traumatic event, and replace them

with positive, more adaptive cognitions (Foa et al., 2005).

       Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is an adaptation of CBT that

utilizes both CBT techniques and trauma-sensitive principles to address the trauma-related

symptoms. According to the Child Welfare Information Gateway (CWIG; 2012), TF-CBT can be

summarized via the acronym PRACTICE:

                                                5-22

       •   P: Psycho-education about the traumatic event. This includes discussion about the

           event itself, as well as typical emotional and/or behavioral responses to the event.

       •   R: Relaxation Training. Teaching the patient how to engage in various types of

           relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation.

       •   A: Affect. Discussing ways for the patient to effectively express their emotions/fears

           related to the traumatic event.

       •   C: Correcting negative or maladaptive thoughts.

       •   T: Trauma Narrative. This involves having the patient relive the traumatic event

           (verbally or written), including as many specific details as possible.

       •   I: In vivo exposure (see above).

       •   C: Co-joint family session. This provides the patient with strong social support and a

           sense of security. It also allows family members to learn about the treatment so that

           they are able to assist the patient if necessary.

       •   E: Enhancing Security. Patients are encouraged to practice the coping strategies they

           learn in TF-CBT to prepare for when they experience these triggers out in the real

           world, as well as any future challenges that may come their way.



5.6.4. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)

       EMDR is a controversial treatment for a few reasons; however, the fact that the treatment

emerged from a personal observation over a theory is among the most argued reasons. In the late

1980s, psychologist Francine Shapiro found that by focusing her eyes on the waving leaves

during her daily walk, her troubling thoughts resolved on their own. From this observation, she

concluded that lateral eye movements facilitate the cognitive processing of traumatic thoughts

                                                5-23
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


(Shapiro, 1989). While EMDR has evolved somewhat since Shapiro’s first claims, the basic

components of EMDR consist of lateral eye movement induced by the therapist moving their

index finger back and forth, approximately 35 cm from the client’s face, as well as components

of cognitive-behavioral therapy and exposure therapy. The following 8-step approach is the

standard treatment approach of EMDR (Shapiro & Maxfield, 2002):

       1. Patient History and Treatment Planning - Identify trauma symptoms and potential

           barriers to treatment.

       2. Preparation - Psychoeducation of trauma and treatment.

       3. Assessment- Careful and detailed evaluation of the traumatic event. Patient identifies

           images, cognitions, and emotions related to the traumatic event, as well as trauma-

           related physiological symptoms.

       4. Desensitization and Reprocessing - Holding the trauma image, cognition, and

           emotion in mind, while simultaneously assessing their physiological symptoms, the

           patient must track the clinician’s finger movement for approximately 20 seconds. At

           this time, the patient must “blank it out” and let go of the memory.

       5. Installation of Positive Cognitions - Once the negative image, cognition, and

           emotions are reduced, the patient must hold onto a positive image or thought while

           again tracking the clinician’s finger movement for approximately 20 seconds.

       6. Body Scan - Patient must identify any lingering bodily sensations while again

           tracking the clinician’s fingers for a third time to discard any remaining trauma

           symptoms.




                                               5-24
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


       7. Closure - Patient is provided with positive coping strategies and relaxation techniques

           to assist with any recurrent cognitions or emotions related to the traumatic

           experience.

       8. Reevaluation - Clinician assesses if treatment goals were met. If not, schedules

           another treatment session and identifies remaining symptoms.



       As you can see from above, only steps 4-6 are specific to EMDR; the remaining

treatment is essentially a combination of exposure therapy and cognitive-behavioral techniques.

Because of the high overlap between treatment techniques, there have been quite a few studies

comparing the treatment efficacy of EMDR to TF-CBT and exposure therapy. While research

initially failed to identify a superior treatment, often citing EMDR and TF-CBT as equally

efficacious in treating PTSD symptoms (Seidler & Wagner, 2006), more recent studies have

found that EMDR may be superior to that of TF-CBT, particularly in psycho-oncology patients

(Capezzani et al., 2013; Chen, Zang, Hu & Liang, 2015). While meta-analytic studies continue to

debate which treatment is the most effective in treating PTSD symptoms, the World Health

Organization’s (2013) publication on the Guidelines for the Management of Conditions

Specifically Related to Stress, identified TF-CBT and EMDR as the only recommended

treatment for individuals with PTSD.

5.6.5. Psychopharmacological Treatment

       While psychopharmacological interventions have been shown to provide some relief,

particularly to veterans with PTSD, most clinicians agree that resolution of symptoms cannot be

accomplished without implementing exposure and/or cognitive techniques that target the

physiological and maladjusted thoughts maintaining the trauma symptoms. With that said,

clinicians agree that psychopharmacology interventions are an effective second line of treatment,

particularly when psychotherapy alone does not produce relief from symptoms.

       Among the most common types of medications used to treat PTSD symptoms are

selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; Bernardy & Friedman, 2015). As previously

discussed in the depression chapter, SSRIs work by increasing the amount of serotonin available

to neurotransmitters. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors

(MAOIs) are also recommended as second-line treatments. Their effectiveness is most often

observed in individuals who report co-occurring major depressive disorder symptoms, as well as

those who do not respond to SSRIs (Forbes et al., 2010). Unfortunately, due to the effective CBT

and EMDR treatment options, research on psychopharmacological interventions has been

limited. Future studies exploring other medication options are needed to determine if there are

alternative medication options for stress/trauma disorder patients.

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   Several treatment approaches are available to clinicians to alleviate the
       symptoms of trauma- and stress-related disorders.
   •   The first approach, psychological debriefing, has individuals who have
       recently experienced a traumatic event discuss or process their thoughts
       related to the event and within 72 hours.
   •   Another approach is to expose the individual to a fear hierarchy and then
       have them use positive coping strategies such as relaxation techniques to
       reduce their anxiety or to toss the fear hierarchy out and have the person
       experience the most distressing memories or images at the beginning of
       treatment.
   •   The third approach is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and attempts to
       identify and challenge the negative cognitions surrounding the traumatic
       event and replace them with positive, more adaptive cognitions.
   •   The fourth approach, called EMDR, involves an 8-step approach and the
       tracking of a clinician’s fingers which induces lateral eye movements and
       aids with the cognitive processing of traumatic thoughts.
   •   Finally, when psychotherapy does not produce relief from symptoms,
       psychopharmacology interventions are an effective second line of treatment
       and may include SSRIs, TCAs, and MAOIs.

Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe dissociative disorders.

       •   Describe how Dissociative Identity Disorder presents.

       •   Describe how dissociative amnesia presents.

       •   Describe how depersonalization/derealization presents.



       Dissociative disorders are a group of disorders characterized by symptoms of disruption

in consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, motor control, or behavior (APA,

2013). These symptoms are likely to appear following a significant stressor or years of ongoing

stress (i.e., abuse; Maldonadao & Spiegel, 2014). Occasionally, one may experience temporary

dissociative symptoms due to lack of sleep or ingestion of a substance; however, these would not

qualify as a dissociative disorder due to the lack of impairment in functioning. Furthermore,

individuals who suffer from acute stress disorder and PTSD often experience dissociative

symptoms, such as amnesia, flashbacks, depersonalization and derealization; however, because

of the identifiable stressor (and lack of additional symptoms listed below), they meet diagnostic

criteria for a stress disorder as opposed to a dissociative disorder.

       There are three main types of dissociative disorders: Dissociative Identity Disorder,

Dissociative Amnesia, and Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder.




                                                 6-3
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


6.1.1. Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)

        Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is what people commonly refer to as multiple

personality disorder. The key diagnostic criteria for DID is the presence of two or more distinct

personality states or expressions. The identities are distinct in that they often have a unique tone

of voice, engage in different physical gestures (including gait), and have different personalities—

ranging anywhere from cooperative and sweet to defiant and aggressive. Additionally, the

identities can be of varying ages and gender, have different memories, and sensory-motor

functioning.

        The second main diagnostic criteria for DID is that there must be a gap in the recall of

events, information, or trauma due to the switching of personalities. These gaps are more

excessive than typical forgetting one may experience due to lack of attention. These personalities

must not be a secondary effect of a substance or medical condition (i.e., gap of information due

to seizure).

        While personalities can present at any time, there is generally a dominant or primary

personality that is present the majority of the time. From there, an individual may have several

subpersonalities. Although it is hard to identify how many subpersonalities an individual may

have at one time, it is believed that there are on average 15 subpersonalities for women and 8 for

men (APA, 2000).

        The presentation of switching between personalities varies among individuals and can

range from merely appearing to fall asleep, to very dramatic, involving excessive bodily

movements. While often sudden and unexpected, switching is generally precipitated by a

significant stressor, as the subpersonality best equipped to handle the current stressor will

present. The relationship between subpersonalities varies between individuals, with some

                                                 6-4
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


individuals reporting knowledge of other subpersonalities while others have a one-way amnesic

relationship with subpersonalities, meaning they are not aware of other personalities (Barlow &

Chu, 2014). These individuals will experience episodes of “amnesia” when the primary

personality is not present.



6.1.2. Dissociative Amnesia Disorder

       Dissociative amnesia disorder is identified by the inability to recall important

autobiographical information. This type of amnesia is different from what one would consider

permanent amnesia in that the information was successfully stored in memory; however, the

individual cannot retrieve it. Additionally, individuals experiencing permanent amnesia often

have a neurobiological cause, whereas dissociative amnesia does not (APA, 2013).

       There are a few types of amnesia within dissociative amnesia. Localized amnesia, the

most common type, is the inability to recall events during a specific period. The length of time

within a localized amnesia episode can vary—it can be as short as the time immediately

surrounding a traumatic event, to months or years, should the traumatic event occur that long (as

commonly seen in abuse and combat situations). Selective amnesia is, in a sense, a component

of localized amnesia in that the individual can recall some, but not all, of the details during a

specific period. For example, a soldier may experience dissociative amnesia during the time they

were deployed, yet still have some memories of positive experiences such as celebrating

Thanksgiving dinner or Christmas dinner with their unit.

       Conversely, some individuals experience generalized amnesia where they have a

complete loss of memory of their entire life history, including their own identity. Individuals

who experience this amnesia experience deficits in both semantic and procedural knowledge.

                                                 6-5
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


This means that individuals have no common knowledge of (i.e. cannot identify letters, colors,

numbers) nor do they have the ability to engage in learned skills (i.e. typing shoes, driving car).

       While generalized amnesia is extremely rare, it is also extremely frightening. The onset is

acute, and the individual is often found wandering in a state of disorientation. Many times, these

individuals are brought into emergency rooms by law enforcement following a dangerous

situation such as an individual wandering on a busy road.

       Dissociative fugue is considered to be the most extreme type of dissociative amnesia.

Not only does an individual forget personal information, but they also flee to a different location

(APA, 2013). The degree of the fugue varies among individuals—with some experiencing

symptoms for a short time (only hours) to others lasting years, affording individuals to take on

new identities, careers, and even relationships. Similar to their sudden onset, dissociative fugues

also end abruptly. Post dissociative fugue, the individual generally regains most of their memory

and rarely relapses. Emotional adjustment after the fugue is dependent on the time the individual

spent in the fugue, with those having been in a fugue state longer experiencing more emotional

distress than those who experienced a shorter fugue (Kopelman, 2002).



6.1.3. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder

       Depersonalization/Derealization disorder is categorized by recurrent episodes of

depersonalization and/or derealization. Depersonalization can be defined as a feeling of

unreality or detachment from oneself. Individuals describe this feeling as an out-of-body

experience where you are an observer of your thoughts, feelings, and physical being.

Furthermore, some patients report feeling as though they lack speech or motor control, thus

feeling at times like a robot. Distortions of one’s physical body have also been reported, with

                                                6-6
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


various body parts appearing enlarged or shrunken. Emotionally, one may feel detached from

their feelings, lacking the ability to feel emotions despite knowing they have them.

       Symptoms of derealization include feelings of unreality or detachment from the world—

whether it be individuals, objects, or their surroundings. For example, an individual may feel as

though they are unfamiliar with their surroundings, even though they are in a place they have

been to many times before. Feeling emotionally disconnected from close friends or family

members whom they have strong feelings for is another common symptom experienced during

derealization episodes. Sensory changes have also been reported, such as feeling as though your

environment is distorted, blurry, or even artificial. Distortions of time, distance, and size/shape of

objects may also occur.

       These episodes can last anywhere from a few hours to days, weeks, or even months

(APA, 2013). The onset is generally sudden, and like the other dissociative disorders, is often

triggered by intense stress or trauma. As one can imagine, depersonalization/derealization

disorder can cause significant emotional distress, as well as impairment in one’s daily

functioning (APA, 2013).

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   Dissociative disorders are characterized by disruption in consciousness,
       memory, identity, emotion, perception, motor control, or behavior. They
       include Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), dissociative amnesia, and
       depersonalization/derealization disorder.
   •   First, DID is present when a person has two or more distinct personality
       states or expressions with one becoming the dominant or primary
       personality.
   •   Dissociative amnesia is characterized by the inability to recall important
       autobiographical information, whether during a specific period (localized) or
       one’s entire life (generalized) or forgetting personal information and fleeing
       to a different location (fugue).
   •   Depersonalization/derealization disorder includes a feeling of unreality or
       detachment from oneself (depersonalization) and feelings of unreality or
       detachment from the world (derealization).

                                       6.2. Epidemiology



Section Learning Objectives

    •   Describe the epidemiology of dissociative disorders.



        Dissociative disorders were once believed to be extremely rare; however, more recent

research suggests that they may be more present in the general population than once thought.

Estimates for the prevalence rate of DID is 1.5%, with an equal distribution between men and

women (APA, 2013). Similarly, a large community sample suggested dissociative amnesia

occurs in approximately 1.8% of the population. Unlike DID, females are twice as more likely to

be diagnosed with dissociative amnesia than males (APA, 2013). Similar to trauma-related

disorders, it is believed that more women experience dissociative amnesia due to their increased

chances of encountering significant stress/trauma compared to that of men.

        While many individuals experience brief episodes of depersonalization/derealization

throughout their life, the estimated number of individuals who experience clinically significant

symptoms is estimated to be 2%, with an equal ratio of men and women experiencing these

symptoms (APA, 2013).

        The onset of dissociative disorders is generally late adolescence to early adulthood, with

the exception of DID. Due to the high comorbidity between childhood abuse and DID, it is

believed that symptoms begin in early childhood following the repeated exposure to abuse;

however, the full onset of the disorder is not observed (or noticed by others) until adolescence

(Sar et al., 2014).

 You should have learned the following in this section:
     •       In general, somewhere between 1.5 and 2% of individuals experience a dissociative
             disorder with an equal number of males and females experiencing DID and
             depersonalization/derealization disorder and more females experiencing dissociative
             amnesia.



 Section 6.2 Review Questions

     1. What are the prevalence rates for dissociative disorders? What are some identified
        barriers in determining prevalence rates of these disorders?




                                          6.3. Comorbidity



Section Learning Objectives

         •     Describe the comorbidity of dissociative disorders.



         Given that a traumatic experience often precipitates dissociative disorders, it should not

be surprising that there is a high comorbidity between dissociative disorders and PTSD.

Similarly, depressive disorders are also commonly found in combination with dissociative

disorders, likely due to the impact the disorders have on social and emotional functioning. In

individuals with dissociative amnesia, a wide range of emotions related to their inability to recall

memories during the episode often present once the amnesia episode is in remission (APA,

2013). These emotions frequently contribute to the development of a depressive episode.

         Due to the rarity of these disorders with respect to other mental health disorders, it is

often difficult to truly determine comorbid diagnoses. There has been some evidence of

                                                  6-10

comorbid somatic symptom disorder and conversion disorder, particularly for those who

experience dissociative amnesia. Furthermore, dependent, avoidant, and borderline personality

disorders have been suspected as co-occurring disorders among the dissociative disorder family.




  You should have learned the following in this section:
      •   Many dissociative disorders have been found to have a high comorbidity with
          PTSD and depressive disorders.
      •   Somatic symptom and conversion disorders, as well as some personality
          disorders, have also been found to be comorbid.

                                          6.4. Etiology



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the biological causes of dissociative disorders.

       •   Describe the cognitive causes of dissociative disorders.

       •   Describe the sociocultural causes of dissociative disorders.

       •   Describe the psychodynamic causes of dissociative disorders.



6.4.1. Biological

       While studies on the involvement of genetic underpinnings need additional research,

there is some suggestion that heritability rates for dissociation rage from 50-60% (Pieper, Out,

Bakermans-Kranenburg, Van Ijzendoorn, 2011). However, it is suggested that the combination

of genetic and environmental factors may play a larger role in the development of dissociative

disorders than genetics alone (Pieper, Out, Bakermans-Kranenburg, Van Ijzendoorn, 2011).



6.4.2. Cognitive

       One proposed cognitive theory of dissociative disorders, particularly dissociative

amnesia, is a memory retrieval deficit. More specifically, Kopelman (2000) theorizes that the

combination of psychological stress and various other biopsychosocial predispositions affects the

frontal lobes executive system’s ability to retrieve autobiographical memories (Picard et al.,

2013). Neuroimaging studies have supported this theory by showing deficits to several prefrontal

regions, which is one area responsible for memory retrieval (Picard et al., 2013). Despite these



                                               6-12

findings, there is still some debate over which specific brain regions within the executive system

are responsible for the retrieval difficulties, as research studies have reported mixed findings.

       Specific to DID, neuroimaging studies have shown differences in hippocampus activation

between subpersonalities (Tsai, Condie, Wu & Chang, 1999). As you may recall, the

hippocampus is responsible for storing information from short-term to long-term memory. It is

hypothesized that this brain region is responsible for the generation of dissociative states and

amnesia (Staniloiu & Markowitsch, 2010).



6.4.3. Sociocultural

       The sociocultural model of dissociative disorders has been primarily influenced by

Lilienfeld and colleagues (1999) who argue that the influence of mass media and its publications

of dissociative disorders, provide a model for individuals to not only learn about dissociative

disorders but also engage in similar dissociative behaviors. This theory has been supported by

the significant increase in DID cases after the publication of Sybil, a documentation of a

woman’s 16 subpersonalities (Goff & Simms, 1993).

       These mass media productions are not just suggestive to patients. It has been suggested

that mass media also influences the way clinicians gather information regarding dissociative

symptoms of patients. For example, therapists may unconsciously use questions or techniques in

session that evoke dissociative types of problems in their patients following exposure to a media

source discussing dissociative disorders.

6.4.4. Psychodynamic

       The psychodynamic theory of dissociative disorders assumes that dissociative disorders

are caused by an individual’s repressed thoughts and feelings related to an unpleasant or

traumatic event (Richardson, 1998). In blocking these thoughts and feelings, the individual is

subconsciously protecting himself from painful memories.

       While a single incidence of repression may explain dissociative amnesia, psychodynamic

theorists believe that DID results from repeated exposure to traumatic experiences, such as

childhood abuse, neglect, or abandonment (Dalenberg et al., 2012). According to the

psychodynamic perspective, children who experience repeated traumatic events such as physical

abuse or parental neglect lack the support and resources to cope with these experiences. In an

effort to escape from their current situation, children develop different personalities to essentially

flee the dangerous situation they are in. While there is limited scientific evidence to support this

theory, the nature of severe childhood psychological trauma is consistent with this theory, as

individuals with DID have the highest rate of childhood psychological trauma compared to all

other psychiatric disorders (Sar, 2011).

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   Though there is some evidence for a genetic component to dissociative
       disorders, a combination of genes and environment are thought to play a
       larger role.
   •   A cognitive explanation assumes a memory retrieval deficit, particularly
       related to dissociative amnesia, and differential hippocampus activation
       between subpersonalities in DID.
   •   Mass media is also purported to have caused a rise in dissociative disorders
       due to the attention it gives these disorders in its publications and movies
       such as Sybil.
   •   Finally, repressed thoughts and feelings are thought to be the cause of
       dissociative disorders in the psychodynamic theory.

                                        6.5. Treatment



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Clarify why treatment for dissociative disorders is limited.

       •   Describe treatment options for dissociative identity disorder.

       •   Describe treatment options for dissociative amnesia.

       •   Describe treatment options for depersonalization/derealization.



       Treatment for dissociative disorders is limited for a few reasons. First, with respect to

dissociative amnesia, many individuals recover on their own without any intervention.

Occasionally treatment is sought out after recovery due to the traumatic nature of memory loss.

Second, the rarity of these disorders has offered limited opportunities for research on both the

development and effectiveness of treatment methods. Due to the differences between dissociative

disorders, treatment options will be discussed specific to each disorder.



6.5.1. Dissociative Identity Disorder

       The ultimate treatment goal for DID is the integration of subpersonalities to the point of

final fusion (Chu et al., 2011). Integration refers to the ongoing process of merging

subpersonalities into one personality. Psychoeducation is paramount for integration, as the

individual must have an understanding of their disorder, as well as acknowledge their

subpersonalities. As mentioned above, many individuals have a one-way amnesic relationship

with the subpersonalities, meaning they are not aware of one another. Therefore, the clinician



                                               6-16
                                                                         2nd edition as of August 2020


must first make the individual aware of the various subpersonalities that present across different

situations.

          Achieving integration requires several steps. First, the clinician needs to build a

relationship and strong rapport with the primary personality. From there, the clinician can begin

to encourage communication and coordination between the subpersonalities gradually. Making

the subpersonalities aware of one another, as well as addressing their conflicts, is an essential

component of the integration of subpersonalities, and the core of DID treatment (Chu et al.,

2011).

          Once the individual is aware of their personalities, treatment can continue with the goal

of fusion. Fusion occurs when two or more alternate identities join together (Chu et al., 2011).

When this happens, there is a complete loss of separateness. Depending on the number of

subpersonalities, this process can take quite a while. Once all subpersonalities are fused and the

individual identifies themselves as one unified self, it is believed the patient has reached final

fusion.

          It should be noted that final fusion is difficult to obtain. As you can imagine, some

patients do not find final fusion a desirable outcome, particularly those with harrowing histories;

chronic, severe stressors; advanced age; and comorbid medical and psychiatric disorders, to

name a few. For individuals where final fusion is not the treatment goal, the clinician may work

toward resolution or sufficient integration and coordination of subpersonalities that allows the

individual to function independently (Chu et al., 2011). Unfortunately, individuals that do not

achieve final fusion are at greater risk for relapse of symptoms, particularly those with whose

DID appears to stem from traumatic experiences.



                                                  6-17
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


       Once an individual reaches final fusion, ongoing treatment is essential to maintain this

status. In general, treatment focuses on social and positive coping skills. These skills are

particularly helpful for individuals with a history of traumatic events, as it can help them process

these events, as well as help prevent future relapses.



6.5.2. Dissociative Amnesia

       As previously mentioned, many individuals regain memory without the need for

treatment; however, there is a small population that does require additional treatment. While

there is no evidenced-based treatment for dissociative amnesia, both hypnosis and phasic therapy

have been shown to produce some positive effects in patients with dissociative amnesia.

       6.5.2.1. Hypnosis. One theory of dissociative amnesia is that it is a form of self-hypnosis

and that individuals hypnotize themselves to forget information or events that are unpleasant

(Dell, 2010). Because of this theory, one type of treatment that has routinely been implemented

for individuals with dissociative amnesia is hypnosis. Through hypnosis, the clinician can help

the individual contain, modulate, and reduce the intensity of the amnesia symptoms, thus

allowing them to process the traumatic or unpleasant events underlying the amnesia episode

(Maldonadao & Spiegel, 2014). To do this, the clinician will encourage the patient to think of

memories just before the amnesic episode as though it was the present time. The clinician will

then slowly walk them through the events during the amnesic period in an effort to reorient the

individual to experience these events. This technique is essentially a way to encourage a

controlled recall of dissociated memories, something that is particularly helpful when the

memories include traumatic experiences (Maldonadao & Spiegel, 2014).



                                                6-18
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


       Another form of “hypnosis” is the use of barbiturates, also known as “truth serums,” to

help relax the individual and free their inhibitions. Although not always effective, the theory is

that these drugs reduce the anxiety surrounding the unpleasant events enough to allow the

individual to recall and process these memories in a safe environment (Ahern et al., 2000).



6.5.3. Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder

       Depersonalization/derealization disorder symptoms generally occur for an extensive

period before the individual seeks out treatment. Because of this, there is some evidence to

support that the diagnosis alone is effective in reducing symptom intensity, as it also relieves the

individual’s anxiety surrounding the baffling nature of the symptoms (Medford, Sierra, Baker, &

David, 2005).

       Due to the high comorbidity of depersonalization/derealization disorder with anxiety and

depression, the goal of treatment is often alleviating these secondary mental health symptoms

related to the depersonalization/derealization symptoms. While there has been some evidence to

suggest treatment with an SSRI is effective in improving mood, the evidence for a combined

treatment method of psychopharmacological and psychological treatment is even more

compelling (Medford, Sierra, Baker, & David, 2005). The psychological treatment of preference

is cognitive-behavioral therapy as it addresses the negative attributions and appraisals

contributing to the depersonalization/derealization symptoms (Medford, Sierra, Baker, & David,

2005). By challenging these catastrophic attributions in response to stressful situations, the

individual is able to reduce overall anxiety levels, which consequently reduces

depersonalization/derealization symptoms.

   You should have learned the following in this section:
       •   Treatment for DID involves the integration of subpersonalities to the point
           of final fusion and takes several steps to achieve.
       •   For some patients, this is not possible as they do not find final fusion to be a
           desirable outcome.
       •   Instead, the clinician will work to achieve resolution or sufficient
           integration and coordination of the subpersonalities to allow the person to
           function independently.
       •   For dissociative amnesia, hypnosis and phasic therapy are used, as well as
           barbiturates known as “truth serums.”
       •   Finally, diagnosis alone is sometimes enough to reduce the intensity of
           symptoms related to depersonalization/derealization disorder and due to the
           high comorbidity with anxiety and depression, alleviation of these
           secondary symptoms is often the goal of treatment.

       •   Describe how Generalized Anxiety Disorder presents.

       •   Describe how Specific Phobias present.

       •   Describe how Agoraphobia presents.

       •   Describe how Social Anxiety Disorder presents.

       •   Describe how Panic Disorder presents.



       The hallmark symptoms of anxiety-related disorders are excessive fear or worry related

to behavioral disturbances. Fear is an adaptive response, as it often prepares your body for an

impending threat. Anxiety, however, is more difficult to identify as it is often the response to a

vague sense of threat. The two can be distinguished from one another as fear is related to either a

real or a perceived threat, while anxiety is the anticipation of a future threat (APA, 2013).

       As you will see throughout the chapter, individuals may experience anxiety in many

different forms. Generalized anxiety disorder, the most common of the anxiety disorders, is

characterized by a global and persistent feeling of anxiety. A specific phobia is observed when

an individual experiences anxiety related to a specific object or subject. Similarly, an individual

may experience agoraphobia when they feel fear specific to leaving their home and traveling to

public places. Social anxiety disorder occurs when an individual experiences anxiety related to

social or performance situations, where there is the possibility of being evaluated negatively.

And finally, there is panic disorder, where an individual experiences recurrent panic attacks

consisting of physical and cognitive symptoms.

7.1.1. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

         Generalized anxiety disorder, commonly referred to as GAD, is a disorder

characterized by an underlying excessive worry related to a wide range of events or activities.

While many individuals experience some levels of worry throughout the day, individuals with

GAD experience worry of greater intensity and for longer periods than the average person (APA,

2013). Additionally, they are often unable to control their worry through various coping

strategies, which directly interferes with their ability to engage in daily social and occupational

tasks. Individuals with GAD will also experience somatic symptoms during intensive periods of

anxiety. These somatic symptoms may include sweating, dizziness, shortness of breath,

insomnia, restlessness, or muscle aches (Gelenberg, 2000).



7.1.2. Specific Phobia

         Specific phobia is distinguished by fear or anxiety specific to an object or a situation.

While the amount of fear or anxiety related to the specific object or situation varies among

individuals, it also varies related to the proximity of the object/situation. When individuals are

face-to-face with their specific phobia, immediate fear is present. It should also be noted that

these fears are excessive and irrational, often severely impacting one’s daily functioning (APA,

2013).

         Individuals can experience multiple specific phobias at the same time. In fact, nearly 75%

of individuals with a specific phobia report fear of more than one object (APA, 2013). When

making a diagnosis of specific phobia, it is important to identify the stimulus. Among the most

commonly diagnosed specific phobias are animals, natural environments (height, storms, water),

blood-injection-injury (needles, invasive medical procedures), or situational (airplanes, elevators,

                                                  7-4
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


enclosed places; APA, 2013). Given the high percentage of individuals who experience more

than one specific phobia, all specific phobias should be listed as a diagnosis to identify an

appropriate treatment plan.



7.1.3. Agoraphobia

       Similar to GAD, agoraphobia is defined as an intense fear triggered by a wide range of

situations; however, unlike GAD, the fears are related to situations in which the individual is in

public situations where escape may be difficult. In order to receive a diagnosis of agoraphobia,

there must be a presence of fear in at least two of the following circumstances: using public

transportation such as planes, trains, ships, buses; being in large, open spaces such as parking

lots or on bridges; being in enclosed spaces like stores or movie theaters; being in a large crowd

similar to those at a concert; or being outside of the home in general (APA, 2013). When an

individual is in one (or more) of these situations, they experience significant fear, often reporting

panic-like symptoms (see Panic Disorder). It should be noted that fear and anxiety-related

symptoms are present every time the individual encounters these situations. If symptoms only

occur occasionally, a diagnosis of agoraphobia is not warranted.

       Due to the intense fear and somatic symptoms, individuals will go to great lengths to

avoid these situations, often preferring to remain within their home where they feel safe, thus

causing significant impairment in one’s daily functioning. They may also engage in active

avoidance, where the individual will intentionally avoid agoraphobic situations. These avoidance

strategies may be behavioral, including having food delivery to avoid going to grocery store or

only taking a job that does not require the use of public transportation, or cognitive, by using

distraction and various other cognitive techniques to get through the agoraphobic situation

successfully.



7.1.4. Social Anxiety Disorder

       For social anxiety disorder, the anxiety or fear relates to social situations, particularly

those in which an individual can be evaluated by others. More specifically, the individual is

worried that they will be judged negatively and viewed as stupid, anxious, crazy, boring, or

unlikeable, to name a few. Some individuals report feeling concerned that their anxiety

symptoms will be obvious to others via blushing, stuttering, sweating, trembling, etc. These fears

severely limit an individual’s behavior in social settings.

       To explain social anxiety in greater detail, let’s review the story of Mary. Mary reported

the onset of her social anxiety disorder in early elementary school when teachers would call on

students to read parts of their textbook aloud. Mary stated that she was fearful of making

mistakes while reading and to alleviate this anxiety, she would read several sections ahead of the

class to prepare for her turn to read aloud. Despite her preparedness, one day in 5th grade, Mary

was called to read and she stumbled on a few words. While none of her classmates realized her

mistake, Mary was extremely embarrassed and reported higher levels of anxiety during future

read aloud moments in school. In fact, when she was called upon, Mary stated she would

completely freeze up and not talk at all. After a few moments of not speaking, her teacher would

skip Mary and ask another student to read her section. It took several years and a very supportive

teacher for Mary to begin reading aloud in class again.

       Similar to Mary, individuals with social anxiety disorder report that all or nearly all social

situations provoke this intense fear. Some individuals even report significant anticipatory fear

                                                 7-6
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


days or weeks before a social event is to occur. This anticipatory fear often leads to avoidance of

social events in some individuals; others will attend social events with a marked fear of possible

threats. Because of these fears, there is a significant impact on one’s social and occupational

functioning.

       It is important to note that the cognitive interpretation of these social events is often

excessive and out of proportion to the actual risk of being negatively evaluated. As we saw in

Mary’s case, when she stumbled upon her words while reading to the class, none of her peers

even noticed her mistake. Situations in which individuals experience anxiety toward a real threat,

such as bullying or ostracizing, would not be diagnosed with social anxiety disorder as the

negative evaluation and threat are real.



7.1.5. Panic Disorder

       Panic disorder consists of a series of recurrent, unexpected panic attacks coupled with

the fear of future panic attacks. A panic attack is defined as a sudden or abrupt surge of fear or

impending doom along with at least four physical or cognitive symptoms. Physical symptoms

include heart palpitations, sweating, trembling or shaking, shortness of breath, feeling as though

they are being choked, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, chills or heat sensations, and

numbness/tingling. Cognitive symptoms may consist of feelings of derealization (feelings of

unreality) or depersonalization (feelings of being detached from oneself), the fear of losing

control or ‘going crazy,’ or the fear of dying (APA, 2013). While symptoms generally peak

within a few minutes, it seems much longer for the individual experiencing the panic attack.

       There are two key components to panic disorder—the attacks are unexpected, meaning

there is nothing that triggers them, and they are recurrent, meaning they occur multiple times.

Because these panic attacks occur frequently and are primarily “out of the blue,” they cause

significant worry or anxiety in the individual as they are unsure of when the next attack will

happen. In some individuals, significant behavioral changes such as fear of leaving their home or

attending large events occur as the individual is fearful an attack will happen in one of these

situations, causing embarrassment. Additionally, individuals report worry that others will think

they are “going crazy” or losing control if they were to observe an individual experiencing a

panic attack. Occasionally, an additional diagnosis of agoraphobia is given to an individual with

panic disorder if their behaviors meet diagnostic criteria for this disorder as well (see more

below).

       The frequency and intensity of these panic attacks vary widely among individuals. Some

people report panic attacks occurring once a week for months on end, others report more

frequent attacks multiple times a day, but then experience weeks or months without any attacks.

The intensity of symptoms also varies among individuals, with some patients experiencing

nearly all symptoms and others reporting only 4, the minimum required for the diagnosis.

Furthermore, individuals report variability within their panic attack symptoms, with some panic

attacks presenting with more symptoms than others. At this time, there is no identifying

information (i.e., demographic information) to suggest why some individuals experience panic

attacks more frequently or more severe than others (APA, 2013).

           •   All anxiety disorders share the hallmark symptoms of excessive
               fear or worry related to behavioral disturbances.
           •   GAD is characterized by an underlying excessive worry related to
               a wide range of events or activities and an inability to control their
               worry through coping strategies.
           •   Specific phobia is characterized by fear or anxiety specific to an
               object or a situation and individuals can experience fear of more
               than one object.
           •   Agoraphobia is characterized by intense fear related to situations
               in which the individual is in public situations where escape may
               be difficult.
           •   Social anxiety disorder is characterized by fear or anxiety related
               to social situations, especially when evaluation by others is
               possible.
           •   Panic disorder is characterized by a series of recurrent, unexpected
               panic attacks coupled with the fear of future panic attacks.

         •   Describe the epidemiology of Panic Disorder.



7.2.1. Generalized anxiety disorder

         The prevalence rate for generalized anxiety disorder is estimated to be 3% of the general

population, with nearly 6% of individuals experiencing GAD sometime during their lives. While

it can present at any age, it generally appears first in childhood or adolescence. Similar to most

anxiety-related disorders, females are twice as likely to be diagnosed with GAD as males (APA,

2013).



7.2.2. Specific phobia

         The prevalence rate for specific phobias is 7-9% within the United States. While young

children have a prevalence rate of approximately 5%, teens have nearly a double prevalence rate

than that of the general public at 16%. There is a 2:1 ratio of females to males diagnosed with

specific phobia; however, this rate changes depending on the different phobic stimuli. More

specifically, animal, natural environment, and situational specific phobias are more commonly

diagnosed in females, whereas blood-injection-injury phobia is reportedly diagnosed equally

between genders.



7.2.3. Agoraphobia

          The yearly prevalence rate for agoraphobia across the lifespan is roughly 1.7%. Females

are twice as likely as males to be diagnosed with agoraphobia (notice the trend…). While it can

occur in childhood, agoraphobia typically does not develop until late adolescence/early

adulthood and usually tapers off in later adulthood.



7.2.4. Social anxiety disorder

          The overall prevalence rate of social anxiety disorder is significantly higher in the United

States than in other countries, with an estimated 7% of the US population diagnosed with a social

anxiety disorder. Within the US, the prevalence rate remains the same among children through

adults; however, there appears to a significant decrease in the diagnosis of social anxiety disorder

among older individuals. Regarding gender, there is a higher diagnosis rate in females than

males. This gender discrepancy appears to be greater among children and adolescents than

adults.



7.2.5. Panic disorder

          Prevalence rates for panic disorder are estimated at around 2-3% in adults and

adolescents. Higher rates of panic disorder are found in American Indians and non-Latino

whites. Females are more commonly diagnosed than males with a 2:1 diagnosis rate—this

gender discrepancy is seen throughout the lifespan. Although panic disorder can occur in young

children, it is generally not observed in individuals younger than 14 years of age.




    You should have learned the following in this section:
        •   Prevalence rates for anxiety disorders range from 1.7% for agoraphobia up to 9%

7.3.1. Generalized anxiety disorder

       There is a high comorbidity between generalized anxiety disorder and the other anxiety-

related disorders, as well as major depressive disorder, suggesting they all share common

vulnerabilities, both biological and psychological.



7.3.2. Specific phobia

       Seeing as the onset of specific phobias occurs at a younger age than most other anxiety

disorders, it is generally the primary diagnosis with the occasional generalized anxiety disorder

comorbid diagnosis. Children and teens diagnosed with a specific phobia are at an increased risk

for additional psychopathology later in life. More specifically, other anxiety disorders,

depressive disorders, substance-related disorders, and somatic symptom disorders.

7.3.3. Agoraphobia

        Similar to the other anxiety disorders, comorbid diagnoses include additional anxiety

disorders, depressive disorders, and substance use disorders, all of which typically occurs after

the onset of agoraphobia (APA, 2013). Also, there is high comorbidity between agoraphobia and

PTSD. While agoraphobia can be a symptom of PTSD, an additional diagnosis of agoraphobia is

made when all symptoms of agoraphobia are met in addition to the PTSD symptoms.



7.3.4. Social anxiety disorder

        Among the most common comorbid diagnoses with a social anxiety disorder are other

anxiety-related disorders, major depressive disorder, and substance-related disorders. Generally

speaking, social anxiety disorders will precede that of other mental health disorders, except for

separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia, seeing as these two disorders are more

commonly diagnosed in childhood (APA, 2013). The high comorbidity rate among anxiety-

related disorders and substance-related disorders is likely connected to the efforts of self-

medicating. For example, an individual with social anxiety disorder may consume more alcohol

in social settings in efforts to alleviate the anxiety of the social situation.



7.3.5. Panic disorder

        Panic disorder rarely occurs in isolation, as many individuals also report symptoms of

other anxiety disorders, major depression, and substance abuse. There is mixed evidence as to

whether panic disorder precedes other comorbid psychological disorders—estimates suggest that

1/3 of individuals with panic disorder will experience depressive symptoms prior to panic

symptoms, whereas the remaining 2/3 will experience depressive symptoms concurrently or after

the onset of panic disorder (APA, 2013).

       Unlike some of the other anxiety disorders, there is a high comorbid diagnosis with

general medical symptoms. More specifically, individuals with panic disorder are more likely to

report somatic symptoms such as dizziness, cardiac arrhythmias, asthma, irritable bowel

syndrome, and hyperthyroidism (APA, 2013). The relationship between panic symptoms and

somatic symptoms is unclear; however, there does not appear to be a direct medical cause

between the two.




    You should have learned the following in this section:
        •   Many anxiety disorders are comorbid with one another.
        •   Other common comorbid disorders include depressive disorders and
            substance-related disorders.

       •   Describe the biological causes of anxiety disorders.

       •   Describe the psychological causes of anxiety disorders.

       •   Describe the sociocultural causes of anxiety disorders.



7.4.1. Biological

       7.4.1.1. Biological - Genetic influences. While genetics have been known to contribute

to the presentation of anxiety symptoms, the interaction between genetics and stressful

environmental influences appears to account for more anxiety disorders than genetics alone

(Bienvenu, Davydow, & Kendler, 2011). The quest to identify specific genes that may

predispose individuals to develop anxiety disorders has led researchers to the serotonin

transporter gene (5-HTTLPR). Mutation of the 5-HTTLPR gene is related to a reduction in

serotonin activity and an increase in anxiety-related personality traits (Munafo, Brown, &

Hairiri, 2008).

       7.4.1.2. Biological - Neurobiological structures. Researchers have identified several

brain structures and pathways that are likely responsible for anxiety responses. Among those

structures is the amygdala, the area of the brain that is responsible for storing memories related

to emotional events (Gorman, Kent, Sullivan, & Coplan, 2000). When presented with a fearful

situation, the amygdala initiates a reaction to ready the body for a response. First, the amygdala

triggers the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to prepare for immediate action— either

to fight or flight. The second pathway is activated by the feared stimulus itself, by sending a
                                               7-16
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


sensory signal to the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, for determination if threat is real or

imagined. If it is determined that no threat is present, the amygdala sends a calming response to

the HPA axis, thus reducing the level of fear. If there is a threat present, the amygdala is

activated, producing a fear response.

       Specific to panic disorder is the implication of the locus coeruleus, the brain structure

that serves as an “on-off” switch for norepinephrine neurotransmitters. It is believed that

increased activation of the locus coeruleus results in panic-like symptoms; therefore, individuals

with panic disorder may have a hyperactive locus coeruleus, leaving them more susceptible to

experience more intense and frequent physiological arousal than the general public (Gorman,

Kent, Sullivan, & Coplan, 2000). This theory is supported by studies in which individuals

experienced increased panic symptoms following the injection of norepinephrine (Bourin,

Malinge, & Guitton, 1995).

       Unfortunately, norepinephrine and the locus coeruleus fail to fully explain the

development of panic disorder, as treatment would be much easier if only norepinephrine was

implicated. Therefore, researchers argue that a more complex neuropathway is likely responsible

for the development of panic disorder. More specifically, the corticostriatal-thalamocortical

(CSTC) circuit, also known as the fear-specific circuit, is theorized as a major contributor to

panic symptoms (Gutman, Gorman, & Hirsch, 2004). When an individual is presented with a

frightening object or situation, the amygdala is activated, sending a fear response to the anterior

cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. Additional projection from the amygdala to the

hypothalamus activates endocrinologic responses to fear, releasing adrenaline and cortisol to

help prepare the body to fight or flight (Gutman, Gorman, & Hirsch, 2004). This complex

pathway supports the theory that panic disorder is mediated by several neuroanatomical

structures and their associated neurotransmitters.



7.4.2. Psychological

       7.4.2.1. Psychological - Cognitive. The cognitive perspective on the development of

anxiety related disorders centers around dysfunctional thought patterns. As seen in depression,

maladaptive assumptions are routinely observed in individuals with anxiety-related disorders,

as they often engage in interpreting events as dangerous or overreacting to potentially stressful

events, which contributes to an overall heightened anxiety level. These negative appraisals, in

combination with a biological predisposition to anxiety likely contribute to the development of

anxiety symptoms (Gallagher et al., 2013).

       Sensitivity to physiological arousal not only contributes to anxiety disorders in general,

but also for panic disorder where individuals experience various physiological sensations and

misinterpret them as catastrophic. One explanation for this theory is that individuals with panic

disorder are more susceptible to more frequent and intensive physiological symptoms than the

general public (Nillni, Rohan, & Zvolensky, 2012). Others argue that these individuals have had

more trauma-related experiences in the past, and therefore, are quick to misevaluate their

symptoms as a potential threat. This misevaluation of symptoms as impending disaster likely

maintain symptoms as the cognitive misinterpretations to physiological arousal creates a

negative feedback loop, leading to more physiological changes.

       Social anxiety is also primarily explained by cognitive theorists. Individuals with social

anxiety disorder tend to hold unattainable or extremely high social beliefs and expectations.

Furthermore, they often engage in preconceived maladaptive assumptions that they will behave

                                               7-18
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


incompetently in social situations and that their behaviors will lead to terrible consequences.

Because of these beliefs, they anticipate social disasters will occur and, therefore, avoid social

encounters (or limit them to close friends/family members) in efforts to prevent the disaster

(Moscovitch et al., 2013). Unfortunately, these cognitive appraisals are not only isolated to

before and during the event. Individuals with social anxiety disorder will also evaluate the social

event after it has taken place, often obsessively reviewing the details. This overestimation of

social performance negatively reinforces future avoidance of social situations.

       7.4.2.2. Psychological – Behavioral. The behavioral explanation for the development of

anxiety disorders is mainly reserved for phobias—both specific and social phobia. More

precisely, behavioral theorists focus on classical conditioning - when two events that occur

close together become strongly associated with one another, despite their lack of causal

relationship. Watson and Rayner’s (1920) infamous Little Albert experiment is an example of

how classical conditioning can be used to induce fear through associations. In this study, Little

Albert developed a fear of white rats by pairing a white rate with a loud sound. This experiment,

although lacking ethical standards, was groundbreaking in the development of learned behaviors.

Over time, researchers have been able to replicate these findings (in more ethically sound ways)

to provide further evidence of the role of classical conditioning in the development of phobias.

       7.4.2.3. Psychological – Modeling is another behavioral explanation of the development

of specific and social phobias. In modeling, an individual acquires a fear though observation and

imitation (Bandura & Rosenthal, 1966). For example, when a young child observes their parent

display irrational fears of an animal, the child may then begin to display similar behaviors.

Similarly, seeing another individual being ridiculed in a social setting may increase the chances

of developing social anxiety, as the individual may become fearful that they would experience a

                                                7-19
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


similar situation in the future. It is speculated that the maintenance of these phobias is due to the

avoidance of the feared item or social setting, thus preventing the individual from learning that

the object or situation is not something that should be feared.

       While modeling and classical conditioning largely explain the development of phobias,

there is some speculation that the accumulation of a large number of these learned fears will

develop into GAD. Through stimulus generalization, or the tendency for the conditioned

stimulus to evoke similar responses to other conditions, a fear of one item (such as the dog) may

become generalized to other items (such as all animals). As these fears begin to grow, a more

generalized anxiety will present, as opposed to a specific phobia.



7.4.3. Sociocultural

       Seeing how prominent the biological and psychological constructs are in explaining the

development of anxiety-related disorders, we also need to review the social constructs that

contribute and maintain anxiety disorders. While characteristics such as living in poverty,

experiencing significant daily stressors, and increased exposure to traumatic events are all

identified as significant contributors to anxiety disorders, additional sociocultural influences such

as gender and discrimination have also received considerable attention, mainly due to the

epidemiological nature of the disorder.

       Gender has largely been researched within anxiety disorders due to the consistent

discrepancy in the diagnosis rate between men and women. As previously discussed, women are

routinely diagnosed with anxiety disorders more often than men, a trend that is observed

throughout the entire lifespan. One potential explanation for this discrepancy is the influence of

social pressures on women. Women are more susceptible to experience traumatic experiences

                                                7-20
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


throughout their life, which may contribute to anxious appraisals of future events. Furthermore,

women are more likely to use emotion-focused coping, which is less effective in reducing

distress than problem-focused coping (McLean & Anderson, 2009). These factors may increase

levels of stress hormones within women that leave them susceptible to develop symptoms of

anxiety. Therefore, it appears a combination of genetic, environmental, and social factors may

explain why women tend to be diagnosed more often with anxiety-related disorders.

       Exposure to discrimination and prejudice, particularly relevant to ethnic minorities and

other marginalized groups, can also impact an individual’s anxiety level. Discrimination and

prejudice contribute to negative interactions, which is directly related to negative affect and an

overall decline in mental health (Gibbons et al., 2014). The repeated exposure to discrimination

and prejudice over time can lead to fear responses in individuals, along with subsequent

avoidance of social situations in efforts to protect themselves emotionally.

7.5.1. Generalized Anxiety Disorder

       7.5.1.1. Psychopharmacology. Benzodiazepines, a class of sedative-hypnotic drugs that

will be discussed in more detail in the Substance Abuse module, originally replaced barbiturates

as the leading anti-anxiety medication due to their less addictive nature, yet equally effective

ability to calm individuals at low dosages. Unfortunately, as more research was done on

benzodiazepines, serious side effects, as well as physical dependence of benzodiazepines at large

dosages, has routinely been documented (NIMH, 2013). Due to these negative effects, selective

serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

are generally considered to be first-line medication options for those with GAD. Findings

indicate a 30-50% positive response rate to these psychopharmacological interventions (Reinhold

& Rickels, 2015). Unfortunately, none of these medications continue to provide any benefit once

they are stopped; therefore, other effective treatment options such as CBT, relaxation training,

and biofeedback are often encouraged before the use of pharmacological interventions.

       7.5.1.2. Rational-Emotive therapy. Albert Ellis developed rational emotive therapy in

the mid-1950s as one of the first forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Ellis proposed that

individuals were not aware of the effect their negative thoughts had on their behaviors and

various relationships, and thus, established a treatment to address these thoughts and provide

relief to those suffering from anxiety and depression. The goal of rational emotive therapy is to

identify irrational, self-defeating assumptions, challenge the rationality of those assumptions, and

to replace them with new, more productive thoughts and feelings. By identifying and replacing

these assumptions, one will experience relief of GAD symptoms (Ellis, 2014).

       7.5.1.3. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is discussed in great detail in the

Mood Disorder Module; however, it is also among the most effective treatment options for a

variety of anxiety disorders, including GAD. Findings suggest 60 percent of individuals report a

significant reduction/elimination in anxious thoughts one-year post treatment (Hanrahan, Field,

Jones, & Davy, 2013). The fundamental goal of CBT is a combination of cognitive and

behavioral strategies aimed to identify and restructure maladaptive thoughts while also providing

opportunities to utilize these more effective thought patterns through exposure-based

experiences. Through repetition, the individual will be able to identify and replace anxious

thoughts outside of therapy sessions, ultimately reducing their overall anxiety levels (Borkovec,

& Ruscio, 2001).

       7.5.1.4. Biofeedback. Biofeedback provides a visual representation of a patient’s

physiological arousal. To achieve this feedback, a patient is connected to a computer that

provides continuous information on their physiological states. There are several ways a patient

can connect to the computer. Among the most common is electromyography (EMG). EMG

measures the amount of muscle activity currently experienced by the individual. An electrode is

                                               7-24
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


placed on a patient’s skin just above a major muscle group, usually the forearm or the forehead.

Other common areas of measurement are electroencephalography (EEG), which measures the

neurofeedback or brain activity; heart rate variability (HRV), which measures autonomic

activity such as heart rate or blood pressure; and galvanic skin response (GSR) which measures

sweat.

         Once the patient is connected to the biofeedback machine, the clinician can walk the

patient through a series of relaxation scripts or techniques as the computer simultaneously

measures the changes in muscle tension. The theory behind biofeedback is that in providing a

patient with a visual representation of changes in their physiological state, they become more

skilled at voluntarily reducing their physiological arousal, and thus, their overall sense of anxiety

or stress. While research has identified only a modest effect of biofeedback on anxiety levels,

patients do report a positive experience with the treatment due to the visual feedback of their

physiological arousal (Brambrink, 2004).



7.5.2. Specific Phobias

         7.5.2.1. Exposure treatments. While there are many treatment options for specific

phobias, research routinely supports the behavioral techniques as the most effective treatment

strategies. Seeing as the behavioral theory suggests phobias develop via classical conditioning,

the treatment approach revolves around breaking the maladaptive association between the object

and fear. This is generally accomplished through exposure treatments. As the name implies, the

individual is exposed to their feared stimuli. This can be done in several different approaches:

systematic desensitization, flooding, and modeling.



                                                7-25
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


       Systematic desensitization is an exposure technique that utilizes relaxation strategies to

help calm the individual as they are presented with the fearful object. The notion behind this

technique is that both fear and relaxation cannot exist at the same time; therefore, the individual

learns how to replace their fearful reaction with a calm, relaxing reaction.

       To begin, the patient, with assistance from the clinician, will identify a fear hierarchy, or

a list of feared objects/situations ordered from least fearful to most fearful. After teaching several

different types of relaxation techniques, the clinician will present items from the fear hierarchy,

starting from the least fearful object/subject, while the patient practices using the learned

relaxation techniques. The presentation of the feared object/situation can be in person—in vivo

exposure—or it can be imagined—imaginal exposure. Imaginal exposure tends to be less

intensive than in vivo exposure; however, it is less effective than in vivo exposure in eliminating

the phobia. Depending on the phobia, in vivo exposure may not be an option, such as with a fear

of a tornado. Once the patient can effectively employ relaxation techniques to reduce their

anxiety to a manageable level, the clinician will slowly move up the fear hierarchy until the

individual does not experience excessive fear of all objects on the list.

       Flooding is another exposure technique in which the clinician does not utilize a fear

hierarchy, but rather repeatedly exposes the individual to their most feared object or situation.

Similar to systematic desensitization, flooding can be done in either in vivo or imaginal

exposure. Clearly, this technique is more intensive than systematic or gradual exposure to feared

objects. Because of this, patients are at a greater likelihood of dropping out of treatment, thus not

successfully overcoming their phobias.

       Modeling is another common technique used to treat phobia disorders (Kelly, Barker,

Field, Wilson, & Reynolds, 2010). In this technique, the clinician approaches the feared

                                                7-26
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


object/subject while the patient observes. As the name implies, the clinician models appropriate

behaviors when exposed to the feared stimulus, showing that the phobia is irrational. After

modeling several times, the clinician encourages the patient to confront the feared stimulus with

the clinician, and then ultimately, without the clinician.



7.5.3. Agoraphobia

       Similar to the treatment approaches for specific phobias, exposure-based techniques are

among the most effective treatment options for individuals with agoraphobia. However, unlike

the high success rate in specific phobias, exposure treatment for agoraphobia has been less

effective in providing complete relief of the disorder. The success rate may be impacted by the

high comorbidity rate of agoraphobia and panic disorder. Because of the additional presentation

of panic symptoms, exposure treatments alone are not the most effective in eliminating

symptoms as residual panic symptoms often remain (Craske & Barlow, 2014). Therefore, the

best treatment approach for those with agoraphobia and panic disorder is a combination of

exposure and CBT techniques (see Panic disorder treatment).

       For individuals with agoraphobia without panic symptoms, the use of group therapy in

combination with individual exposure therapy has been identified as a successful treatment

option. The group therapy format allows the individual to engage in exposure-based field trips to

various community locations, while also maintaining a sense of support and security from a

group of individuals whom they know. Research indicates that this type of treatment provides

improvement form nearly 60 to 80 percent of patients with agoraphobia; however, there is a

relatively high rate of partial relapse, suggesting that long-term treatment or booster sessions

should continue for several years at minimum (Craske & Barlow, 2014).

                                                7-27
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


7.5.4. Social Anxiety Disorder

       7.5.4.1. Exposure. A hallmark treatment approach for all anxiety disorders is exposure.

Specific to social anxiety disorder, the individual is encouraged to engage in social situations

where they are likely to experience increased anxiety. Initially, the clinician will role-play

various social situations with the patient so that the patient can practice social interactions in a

safe, controlled environment (Rodebaugh, Holaway, & Heimberg, 2004). As the patient becomes

habituated to the interaction with the clinician, the clinician and patient may venture outside of

the treatment room and engage in social settings with random strangers at various locations such

as fast-food restaurants, local stores, libraries, etc. The patient is encouraged to continue with

these exposures outside of treatment to help reduce anxiety related to social situations.

       7.5.4.2. Social skills training. This treatment is specific to social anxiety disorder as it

focuses on the patient’s skill deficits or inadequate social interactions that contribute to their

negative social experiences and anxiety. During a session, the clinician may use a combination of

skills such as modeling, corrective feedback, and positive reinforcement to provide feedback and

encouragement to the patient regarding their behavioral interactions (Rodebaugh, Holaway, &

Heimberg, 2004). By incorporating the clinician’s feedback into their social repertoire, the

patient can engage in positive social behaviors outside of the treatment room and improve their

overall social interactions while reducing ongoing social anxiety.

       7.5.4.3. Cognitive restructuring. While exposure and social skills training are suitable

treatment options, research routinely supports the need to incorporate cognitive restructuring as

an additive component in treatment to provide substantial symptom reduction. Similar to

cognitive restructuring previously discussed in the Mood Disorder module, the clinician will

work with the therapist to identify negative, automatic thoughts that contribute to the distress in

                                                 7-28
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


social situations. The clinician can then help the patient establish new, positive thoughts to

replace these negative thoughts. Research indicates that implementing cognitive restructuring

techniques before, during, and after exposure sessions enhances the overall effects of treatment

of social anxiety disorder (Heimberg & Becker, 2002).



7.5.5. Panic Disorder

       7.5.5.1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is the most effective treatment

option for individuals with panic disorder as the focus is on correcting misinterpretations of

bodily sensations (Craske & Barlow, 2014). Nearly 80 percent of people with panic disorder

report complete remission of symptoms after mastering the following five components of CBT

for panic disorder (Craske & Barlow, 2014).

       7.5.5.2. Psychoeducation. Treatment begins by educating the patient on the nature of

panic disorder, the underlying causes of panic disorder, as well as the mechanisms that maintain

the disorder such as the physical, cognitive, and behavioral response systems (Craske & Barlow,

2014). This part of treatment is fundamental in correcting any myths or misconceptions about

panic symptoms, as they often contribute to the exacerbation of panic symptoms.

       7.5.5.3. Self-monitoring. Self-monitoring, or the awareness of self-observation, is

essential to the CBT treatment process for panic disorder. In this part of treatment, the individual

is taught to identify the physiological cues immediately leading up to and during a panic attack.

Then, the patient is encouraged to recognize and document the thoughts and behaviors associated

with these physiological symptoms. By bringing awareness to the symptoms, as well as the

relationship between physical arousal and cognitive-behavioral responses, the patient learns the



                                                7-29
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


fundamental processes with which they can manage their panic symptoms (Craske & Barlow,

2014).

         7.5.5.4. Relaxation training. Similar to that in exposure-based treatment for phobias,

prior to engaging in exposure training, the individual must learn relaxation techniques to apply

during onset of panic attacks. While breathing training was once included as the relaxation

training technique of choice for panic disorder due to the high report of hyperventilation during

panic attacks, more recent research has failed to support this technique as effective in the use of

panic disorder (Schmidt et al., 2000). Findings suggest that breathing retraining is more

commonly misused as a safety behavior or means for avoiding physical symptoms as opposed to

an effective physiological response to stress (Craske & Barlow, 2014).

         7.5.5.5. Progressive muscle relaxation. To replace the breathing retraining, Craske &

Barlow (2014) suggest progressive muscle relaxation (PMR). In PMR, the patient learns to

tense and relax various large muscle groups throughout the body. Generally speaking, the patient

is encouraged to start at either the head or the feet, and gradually work their way through the

entire body, holding the tension for roughly 10 seconds before relaxing. The theory behind PMR

is that in tensing the muscles for a prolonged period, the individual exhausts those muscles,

forcing them (and eventually) the entire body to engage in relaxation (McCallie, Blum, & Hood,

2006).

         7.5.5.6. Cognitive restructuring. Cognitive restructuring, or the ability to recognize

cognitive errors and replace them with alternate, more appropriate thoughts, is likely the most

powerful part of CBT treatment for panic disorder, aside from the exposure part. Similar to the

discussion in the Mood Disorder module, cognitive restructuring involves identifying the role of

thoughts in generating and maintaining emotions. The clinician encourages the patient to view

                                                7-30
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


these thoughts as “hypotheses” as opposed to fact, which allows the beliefs to be questioned and

challenged. This is where the detailed recordings in the self-monitoring section of treatment are

helpful. By discussing what the patient has recorded for the relationship between physiological

arousal and thoughts/behaviors, the clinician can help the patient restructure the maladaptive

thought processes to more positive thought processes, which in return, helps to reduce fear and

anxiety.

       7.5.5.7. Exposure. As discussed in detail in the specific phobia section, the patient is next

encouraged to engage in a variety of exposure techniques such as in vivo exposure and

interoceptive exposure, while also incorporating the cognitive restructuring and relaxation

techniques previously learned to reduce and eliminate ongoing distress. Interoceptive exposure

involves inducing panic-specific symptoms to the individual repeatedly for a prolonged period,

so that maladaptive thoughts about the sensations can be disconfirmed and conditional anxiety

responses are extinguished (Craske & Barlow, 2014). Some examples of these exposure

techniques include spinning a patient repeatedly in a chair to induce dizziness and breathing in a

paper bag to cause hyperventilation. These treatment approaches can be presented gradually;

however, the patient must endure the physiological sensations for at least 30 seconds to 1 minute

to ensure adequate time for applying cognitive strategies to misappraisal of cognitive symptoms

(Craske & Barlow, 2014).

       Interoceptive exposure is continued both in and outside of treatment until panic

symptoms remit. Over time, the habituation of fear within an exposure session ultimately leads to

habituation across treatment and long-term remission of panic symptoms (Foa & McNally,

1996). Occasionally, panic symptoms will return in individuals who report complete remission



                                               7-31
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


of panic disorder. Follow-up booster sessions reviewing the steps above are generally effective in

eliminating symptoms again.

       7.5.5.8. Pharmacological interventions. According to Craske & Barlow (2014), nearly

half of patients with panic disorder present to psychotherapy already on medication, likely

prescribed by their primary care physician. Some researchers argue that anti-anxiety medications

impede the progress of CBT treatment as the individual is not able to fully experience the

physiological sensations during exposure sessions, thus limiting their ability to modify

maladaptive thoughts and maintaining the panic symptoms. Results from large clinical trials

suggest no advantage during or immediately after treatment of combining CBT and medication

(Craske & Barlow, 2014). Additionally, when the medication was discontinued post-treatment,

the CBT+ medication groups fared worse than the CBT treatment-only groups, thus supporting

the theory that immersion in interoceptive exposure is limited due to the use of medication.

Therefore, it is suggested that medications be reserved for those who do not respond to CBT

therapy alone (Kampman, Keijers, Hoogduin & Hendriks, 2002).

       Psychological disorders that feature somatic symptoms are often challenging to diagnose

due to the internalizing nature of the disorder, meaning there is no real way for a clinician to

measure the somatic symptom. Furthermore, the somatic symptoms could take on many forms.

For example, the individual may be faking the physical symptoms, imagining the symptoms,

exaggerating the symptoms, or they could be real and triggered by external factors such as stress

or other psychological disorders. The symptoms also may be part of a real medical illness or

disorder, and therefore, the symptoms should be treated medicinally.

       All of the disorders within this chapter share a common feature: there is a presence of

somatic symptoms associated with significant distress or impairment. Oftentimes, individuals

with a somatic disorder will present to their primary care physician with their physical

complaints. Occasionally, they will be referred to clinical psychologists after an extensive

medical evaluation concludes that a medical diagnosis cannot explain their current symptoms. As

you will read further, despite their similarities, there are key features among the various disorders

that distinguish them from one another.



8.1.1. Somatic Symptom Disorder

       Individuals with somatic symptom disorder often present with multiple somatic

symptoms at one time. These symptoms are significant enough to impact their daily functioning,

such as preventing them from attending school, work, or family obligations. The symptoms can

be localized (i.e., in one spot) or diffused (i.e., entire body), and can be specific or nonspecific

(e.g., fatigue). Individuals with somatic symptom disorder often report excessive thoughts,

feelings, or behaviors surrounding their somatic symptoms (APA, 2013). For example,

individuals with somatic symptom disorder may spend an excessive amount of time or energy

evaluating their symptoms, as well as the potential seriousness of their symptoms. A lack of

medical explanation is not needed for a diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder, as it is assumed

that the individual’s suffering is authentic. Somatic symptom disorder is often diagnosed when

another medical condition is present, as these two diagnoses are not mutually exclusive.

       Somatic symptom disorder patients generally present with significant worry about their

illness. Their interpretation of symptoms is often viewed as threatening, harmful, or troublesome

(APA, 2013). Because of their negative appraisals, they often fear that their medical status is

                                                 8-4
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


more serious than it typically is, and high levels of distress are often reported. Oftentimes these

patients will “shop” at different physician offices to confirm the seriousness of their symptoms.



8.1.2. Illness Anxiety Disorder

       Illness anxiety disorder, previously known as hypochondriasis, involves an excessive

preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious medical illness. The key distinction between

illness anxiety disorder and somatic symptom disorder is that an individual with illness anxiety

disorder does not typically present with any somatic symptoms. Occasionally an individual will

present with a somatic symptom; however, the intensity of the symptom is mild and does not

drive the anxiety. Acquiring a serious illness drives concerns.

       Individuals with illness anxiety disorder generally are cleared medically; however, some

individuals are diagnosed with a medical illness. In this case, their anxiety surrounding the

severity of their disorder is excessive or disproportionate to their actual medical diagnosis. While

an individual’s concern for an illness may be due to a physical sign or sensation, most

individual’s concerns are derived not from a physical complaint, but their actual anxiety related

to a suspected medical disorder. This excessive worry often expands to general anxiety regarding

one’s health and disease. Unfortunately, this anxiety does not appease even after reassurance

from a medical provider or negative test results, even when provided by multiple physicians and

diagnostic tests.

       As one can imagine, the preoccupation and anxiety associated with attaining a medical

illness severely impacts daily functioning. The individual will often spend copious amounts of

time scanning and analyzing their body for “clues” of potential ailments. Additionally, an

excessive amount of time is often spent on internet searches related to symptoms and rare

                                                8-5

illnesses. Although extreme, some cases of invalidism have been reported due to illness anxiety

disorder (APA, 2013).



8.1.3. Conversion Disorder

       Conversion disorder occurs when an individual presents with one or more symptoms of

voluntary motor or sensory function (APA, 2013). Common motor symptoms include weakness

or paralysis, abnormal movements (e.g., tremors), and gait abnormalities (i.e., limping).

Additionally, sensory symptoms such as altered, reduced, or absent skin sensations, and vision or

hearing impairment are also reported in many individuals. Less commonly seen are epileptic

seizures and episodes of unresponsiveness resembling fainting or coma (Marshall et al., 2013).

       According to the DSM-5 (APA, 2013), symptoms of conversion disorder are described as

either functional or psychogenic. Functional symptoms would be those of abnormal central

nervous system functioning and are often assumed to be associated with a neurological disorder.

Psychogenic symptoms have no biological basis for the symptoms, and therefore, are

psychological in nature.

       The most challenging aspect of conversion disorder is the complex relationship with a

medical evaluation. While a diagnosis of conversion disorder requires that the symptoms not be

explained by a neurological disease, just because a medical provider fails to provide evidence

that it is not a specific medical disorder is not sufficient. Therefore, there must be evidence of an

incompatibility of the medical disorder and the symptoms. For example, an individual

experiencing seizures would require a normal simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG),

indicating that there is not epileptic activity during what was previously thought of as an

epileptic seizure.

8.1.4. Factitious Disorder

       Factitious disorder, commonly referred to as Munchausen syndrome, differs from the

three previously discussed somatic disorders in that there is deliberate falsification of medical or

psychological symptoms of oneself or another, with the overall intention of deception. While a

medical condition may be present, the severity of impairment related to the medical condition is

more excessive due to the individual’s need to deceive those around them. Even more alarming

is that this disorder is not only observed in the individual leading the deception— it can also be

present in another individual, often a child or an individual with a compromised mental status

who is not aware of the deception behind their illness (also known as Munchausen by Proxy).

       Some examples of factitious disorder behaviors include but are not limited to altering a

urine or blood test, falsifying medical records, ingesting a substance that would indicate

abnormal laboratory results, physically injuring oneself, and inducing illness by injecting or

ingesting a harmful substance (APA, 2013). While it is unclear why an individual would want to

fake their own (or someone else’s) physical illness, there is some evidence suggesting that

factors such as depression, lack of parental support during childhood, or an excessive need for

social support may contribute to this disorder (McDermott, Leamon, Feldman, & Scott, 2012;

Ozden & Canat, 1999; Feldman & Feldman, 1995).

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   Somatic symptom disorder is characterized by the presence of multiple
       somatic symptoms, whether localized or diffused and specific or
       nonspecific, at one time which impact daily functioning.
   •   Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by concern over having or
       acquiring a serious illness, and not the actual presence of somatic
       symptoms. Individuals spend a great deal of time scanning and analyzing
       their body for “clues” of potential ailments.
   •   Conversion disorder is characterized by one or more symptoms of
       voluntary motor or sensory function, which are either functional or
       psychogenic.
   •   Factitious disorder is characterized by deliberate falsification of medical or
       psychological symptoms of oneself or another, with the overall intention
       of deception.

                                      8.2. Epidemiology



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the epidemiology of somatic disorders.



       The prevalence rates for somatic disorders are often difficult to determine; however,

overall estimates of somatic symptom disorder are around 5-7% (APA, 2013). There is a trend

that females report more somatic symptoms than males; thus more females are diagnosed with

somatic symptom disorder than males (APA, 2013).

       Seeing as illness anxiety disorder is a newer diagnosis (replacing hypochondriasis),

prevalence rates are largely based on the previous disorder. Previous findings suggest that illness

anxiety disorder occurs in 1-10% of the general population and is equal among males and

females.

       Prevalence rates of factitious disorder could not be obtained; however, the illness is

incredibly rare. More recent research has indicated that nearly 8% of individuals admitted to a

psychiatric inpatient unit present with factitious symptoms (Catalina, Gomez, de Cos, 2008). It is

believed that these symptoms are likely related to physical symptoms felt in the past and are

therefore exaggerated, as opposed to deliberately feigning the symptoms.

    You should have learned the following in this section:
        •   Though prevalence rates for somatic symptom disorders are hard to determine,
            it is believed that between 1 and 10% of the population suffer from one of
            these disorders.
        •   Females are more like to be diagnosed with somatic symptom disorder and are
            as like as males to be diagnosed with illness anxiety disorder.

        1. Create a table of the prevalence rates across the various somatic disorders.
           What are the differences between the disorders? Which prevalence rates are
           higher in children? Adolescents? Women?




                                           8.3. Comorbidity



Section Learning Objectives

       •    Describe the comorbidity of somatic disorders.



       Given that half of psychiatric patients also have an additional medical disorder, 35% have

an undiagnosed medical condition, and approximately 20% reported medical problems caused

their mental condition, it should not come as a surprise that somatic disorders, in general, have

high comorbidity with other psychological disorders (Felker, Yazel, & Short, 1996). More

specifically, anxiety and depression are among the most commonly co-diagnosed disorders for

somatic disorders. While there is not a lot of information regarding specific comorbidities among
                                               8-10

somatic related disorders, there is some evidence to suggest that those with illness anxiety

disorder are at risk of developing somatic symptom and personality disorders (APA, 2013).

Similarly, personality disorders are more common in individuals with conversion disorder than

the general public, with approximately two-thirds of individuals with illness anxiety disorder are

likely to have at least one other psychological disorder (APA, 2013).

       There is also high comorbidity between somatic disorders and other physical disorders

classified as central sensitivity syndromes (CSSs), due to their common central sensitization

symptoms, yet medically unexplained symptoms (McGeary, Harzell, McGeary, & Gatchel,

2016). Disorders included in this group are fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic

fatigue syndrome. Comorbidity rates are estimated at 60% for these functional syndromes and

somatic pain disorder (Egloff et al., 2014).




  You should have learned the following in this section:
      •   Anxiety and depression have a high comorbidity with somatic symptom
          disorders.
      •   Conversion disorder frequently occurs with personality disorders.
      •   Central sensitivity syndrome also has high comorbidity with somatic disorders.

                                          8.4. Etiology



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the psychodynamic causes of somatic disorders.

       •   Describe the cognitive causes of somatic disorders.

       •   Describe the behavioral causes of somatic disorders.

       •   Describe the sociocultural causes of somatic disorders.



8.4.1. Psychodynamic

       Psychodynamic theory suggests that somatic symptoms present as a response against

unconscious emotional issues. Two factors initiate and maintain somatic symptoms: primary

gain and secondary gain. Primary gains produce internal motivators, whereas secondary gains

produce external motivators (Jones, Carmel & Ball, 2008). When you relate this to somatic

disorders, the primary gain, according to psychodynamic theorists, provides protection from the

anxiety or emotional symptoms and/or conflicts. This need for protection is expressed via a

physical symptom such as pain, headache, etc. The secondary gain, the external experiences

from the physical symptoms that maintain these physical symptoms, can range from attention

and sympathy to missed work, obtaining financial assistance, or psychiatric disability, to name a

few.



8.4.2. Cognitive

       Cognitive theorists often believe that somatic disorders are a result of negative beliefs or

exaggerated fears of physiological sensations. Individuals with somatic related disorders may
                                               8-12
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


have a heightened sensitivity to bodily sensations. This sensitivity, combined with their

maladaptive thought patterns, may lead individuals to overanalyze and interpret their

physiological symptoms in a negative light.

       For example, an individual with a headache may catastrophize the symptoms and believe

that their headache is the direct result of a brain tumor, as opposed to stress or other inoculate

reasons. When their medical provider does not confirm this diagnosis, the individual may then

catastrophize even further, believing they have an extremely rare disorder that requires an

evaluation from a specialist.



8.4.3. Behavioral

       Keeping true with the behavioral approach to psychological disorders, behaviorists

propose that somatic disorders are developed and maintained by reinforcers. More specifically,

individuals experiencing significant somatic symptoms are often rewarded by gaining attention

from other people (Witthoft & Hiller, 2010). These rewards may also extend to more significant

factors, such as receiving disability.

       While the behavioral theory of somatic disorders appears to be similar to the

psychodynamic theory of secondary gains, there is a clear distinction between the two—

behaviorists view these gains as the primary reason for the development and maintenance of the

disorder, whereas psychodynamic theorists view these gains as secondary, only after the

underlying conflicts create the disorder.

8.4.4. Sociocultural

        There are a couple of different ways that sociocultural factors contribute to somatic

related disorders. First, there is the social factor of familial influence that likely plays a

significant role in the attention to somatic symptoms. Individuals with somatic symptom disorder

are more likely to have a family member or close friend who is overly attentive to their somatic

symptoms or report high anxiety related to their health (Watt, O’Connor, Stewart, Moon, &

Terry, 2008; Schulte, Petermann, & Noeker, 2010).

        Culturally, Western countries express less of a focus on somatic complaints compared to

those in the Eastern part of the world. This may be explained by the different evaluations of the

relationship between mind and body. For example, Westerners tend to have a view that

psychological symptoms sometimes influence somatic symptoms, whereas Easterners focus more

heavily on the mind-body relationship and how psychological and somatic symptoms interact

with one another. These different cultural beliefs are routinely seen in research where Asian

populations are more likely to report the physical symptoms related to stress than the cognitive

or emotional problems that many in the United States report (Sue & Sue, 2016).

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   Psychodynamic causes of somatic disorders include primary and secondary
       gain.
   •   Cognitive causes of somatic disorders include negative beliefs or
       exaggerated fears of physiological sensations.

       gained from others or receiving disability.

                                         8.5. Treatment

Section Learning Objectives

       •     Describe treatment options for somatic disorders.



       Treatment for these disorders is often difficult as individuals see their problems as

completely medical, and therefore, do not think psychological intervention is necessary

(Lahmann, Henningsen, & Noll-Hussong, 2010). Generally speaking, once an individual does

not find relief from their symptoms after meeting with several different physicians, they often do

willingly engage in psychotherapy, psychopharmacology, or both (Raj et al., 2014).

       Among the most effective treatment approaches is the biopsychosocial model of

treatment. This approach takes into account the various biological, psychological, and social

factors that influence the illness and presenting symptoms (Gatchel et al., 2007). This treatment

is often achieved through a multidisciplinary approach where the symptoms are managed by

many providers, usually including a physician, psychiatrist, and psychologist. The

interdisciplinary approach involves a higher level of care as the multiple disciplines interact with

one another and identify a treatment goal (Gatchel et al., 2007). This approach, although more

difficult to find, particularly in more rural settings, is presumed to be more effective due to the

integration of health care providers and their ability to work together to treat the patient

uniformly.



8.5.1. Psychotherapy

       8.5.1.1. Psychodynamic. Interpersonal psychotherapy, a type of psychodynamic therapy,

has been found to be efficacious in treating somatic disorders. Interpersonal psychotherapy
                                                8-16
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


focuses on the relationship between self-experience and the unconscious, and how these factors

contribute to body dysfunction. This type of treatment has been shown to reduce anxiety,

depression, and improve the overall quality of life immediately following treatment; however,

effects appear to diminish over time (Abass et al., 2014; Steinert et al., 2015).

       8.5.1.2. CBT. Traditional cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) have been employed to

address the cognitive attributions and maladaptive coping strategies that are responsible for the

development and maintenance of the disorder. The most common misattribution for these

disorders is catastrophic thinking, or the rumination about worst-case scenario outcomes.

Additionally, goals of CBT treatment are the acceptance of the medical condition, addressing

avoidance behaviors, and mediating expectations of treatment (Gatchel et al., 2014).

       8.5.1.3. Behavioral. Behavioral therapies have also been shown to effectively manage

complex chronic somatic symptoms, particularly pain. The behavioral approach involves

bringing attention to physiological symptoms, the individual’s attribution to those symptoms,

and the subsequent anxiety produced by the negative attributions (Looper & Kirmayer, 2002).



8.5.2. Psychopharmacology

       Psychopharmacological interventions are rarely used due to possible side effects and

unknown efficacy. Given that these individuals already have a heightened reaction to their

physiological symptoms, there is a high likelihood that the side effects of medication would

produce more harm than help. With that said, psychopharmacological interventions may be

helpful for those individuals who have comorbid psychological disorders such as depression or

anxiety, which may negatively impact their ability to engage in psychotherapy (McGeary,

Harzell, McGeary, & Gatchel, 2016).

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   The biopsychosocial model of treatment is one of the most effective for
       somatic disorders as it takes into account the various biological,
       psychological, and social factors that influence the illness and presenting
       symptoms and includes a multidisciplinary approach.
   •   Psychotherapy options include interpersonal psychotherapy, CBT, and
       behavioral.
   •   Psychopharmacological interventions are rarely used for somatic disorders
       due to the side effects of the medication producing more harm than good.
       When used, they deal with comorbid disorders such as depression or
       anxiety.

            8.6. Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe how psychological factors affecting other medical conditions presents.

       •   List and describe the most common types of psychophysiological disorders.

       •   Describe treatment options for psychological factors affecting other medical

           conditions.



       Although previously known as psychosomatic disorders, the DSM-5 has identified

physical illnesses that are caused or exacerbated by biopsychosocial factors as psychological

factors affecting other medical conditions. This disorder is different than all the previously

mentioned somatic related disorders as the primary focus of the disorder is not the mental

disorder, but rather the physical disorder. It is believed that a lack of positive coping strategies,

psychological distress, or maladaptive health behaviors exacerbate these physical symptoms

(McGeary, Harzell, McGeary, & Gatchel, 2016).



8.6.1. Psychophysiological Disorders

       The most common types of psychophysiological disorders are headaches (migraines and

tension), gastrointestinal (ulcer and irritable bowel), insomnia, and cardiovascular-related

disorders (coronary heart disease and hypertension). We will briefly review these disorders and

discuss the associated psychological features believed to exacerbate symptoms.

       8.6.1.1. Headaches. Among the most common types of headaches are migraines and

tension headaches (Williamson, 1981). Migraine headaches are often more severe and are
                                                 8-19
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


explained by a throbbing pain localized to one side of the head, frequently accompanied by

nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and vertigo. It is believed that migraines are caused by the

blood vessels in the brain narrowing, thus reducing the blood flow to various parts of the brain,

followed by the same vessels later expanding, thus rapidly changing the blood flow. It is

estimated that 23 million people in the US alone suffer from migraines (Williamson, Barker,

Veron-Guidry, 1994).

       Tension headaches are often described as a dull, constant ache localized to one part of the

head or neck; however, it can co-occur in multiple places at one time. Unlike migraines, nausea,

vomiting, and sensitivity to light do not often occur with tension headaches. Tension headaches,

as well as migraines, are believed to be primarily caused by stress as they are in response to

sustained muscle contraction that is often exhibited by those under extreme stress or emotion

(Williamson, Barker, Veron-Guidry, 1994). In efforts to reduce the frequency and intensity of

both migraines and tension headaches, individuals have found relief in relaxation techniques, as

well as the use of biofeedback training to help encourage the relaxation of muscles.

       8.6.1.2. Gastrointestinal. Among the two most common types of gastrointestinal

psychophysiological disorders are ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Ulcers, or

painful sores in the stomach lining, occur when mucus from digestive juices are reduced,

allowing digestive acids to burn a hole into the stomach lining. Among the most common type of

ulcers are peptic ulcers, which are caused by the bacteria H. pylori (Sung, Kuipers, El-Serag,

2009). While there is evidence to support the involvement of stress in the development of

dyspeptic symptoms, the evidence linking stress and peptic ulcers is slowly growing. (Purdy,

2013). Researchers believe that while H. pylori must be present for a peptic ulcer to develop,



                                                8-20
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


increased stress levels may impact the amount of digestive acid present in the stomach lining,

thus increasing the frequency and intensity of symptoms (Sung, Kuipers, El-Serag, 2009).

       IBS is a chronic, functional disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. Common symptoms of

IBS include abdominal pain and extreme bowel habits (diarrhea or constipation). It affects up to

a quarter of the population and is responsible for nearly half of all referrals to gastroenterologists

(Sandler, 1990).

       Because IBS is a functional disorder, there are no known structural, chemical, or

physiological abnormalities responsible for the symptoms. However, there is conclusive

evidence that IBS symptoms are related to psychological distress, particularly in those with

anxiety or depression. Although more research is needed to pinpoint the timing between the

onset of IBS and psychological disorders, preliminary evidence suggests that psychological

distress is present before IBS symptoms. Therefore, IBS may be best explained as a somatic

expression of associated psychological problems (Sykes, Blanchard, Lackner, Keefer, &

Krasner, 2003).

       8.6.1.3. Insomnia. Insomnia, the difficulty falling or staying asleep, occurs in more than

one-third of the US population, with approximately 10% of patients reporting chronic insomnia

(Perlis & Gehrman, 2013). While exact pathways of chronic psychophysiological insomnia are

unclear, there is evidence of some biopsychosocial factors that may predispose an individual to

develop insomnia such as anxiety, depression, and overactive arousal systems (Trauer et al.,

2015). Part of the difficulty with insomnia is the fact that these psychological symptoms can

impact one’s ability to fall asleep; however, we also know that lack of adequate sleep also

predisposes individuals to increased psychological distress. Due to this cyclic nature of



                                                8-21
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


psychological distress and insomnia, intervention for both sleep issues as well as psychological

issues is vital to managing symptoms.

       8.6.1.4. Cardiovascular. Heart disease has been the leading cause of death in the United

States for the past several decades. Costs related to disability, medical procedures, and societal

burdens are estimated to be $444 billion a year (Purdy, 2013). With this large financial burden,

there have been considerable efforts to identify risk and protective factors in predicting

cardiovascular mortality.

       Researchers have identified that depression is a predictor of early-onset coronary heart

disease (Ketterer, Knysk, Khanal, & Hudson, 2006). More specifically, there is a five-fold

increase of depression in those with coronary heart disease than the general population (Ketterer,

Knysk, Khanal, & Hudson, 2006). Additionally, anxiety and anger have also been identified as

an early predictor of cardiac events, suggesting psychological interventions aimed at reducing

anxiety and establishing positive coping strategies for anger management may be effective in

reducing future cardiac events (Ketterer, Knysk, Khanal, & Hudson, 2006).

       8.6.1.5. Hypertension. Also called or chronically elevated blood pressure, is also found

to be affected by psychological factors. More specifically, constant stress, anxiety, and

depression have all been found to impact the likelihood of a cardiac event due to their impact on

vasoconstriction (Purdy, 2013). Elevated inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein,

which is indicative of plaque instability, has been found in chronically depressed individuals,

thus predisposing them to potential heart attacks (Ketterer, Knysk, Khanal, & Hudson, 2006).

8.6.2. Treatments for Psychological Factors Affecting Other Medical Conditions

        As more information regarding contributing factors to psychophysiological disorders is

discovered, more psychological treatment approaches have been developed and applied to these

medical problems. The most common types of treatments include relaxation training,

biofeedback, hypnosis, traditional CBT treatments, group therapy, as well as a combination of

the previous treatments.

        8.6.2.1. Relaxation training. Relaxation training essentially teaches individuals how to

relax their muscles on command. While relaxation is used in combination with other

psychological interventions to reduce anxiety (as seen in PTSD and various anxiety disorders), it

has also been shown to be effective in treating physical symptoms such as headaches, chronic

pain, as well as pain related to specific causes (e.g., injection sites, side effects of medications;

McKenna et al., 2015).

        8.6.2.2. Biofeedback. Biofeedback is a unique psychological treatment in which an

individual is connected to a machine (usually a computer) that allows for continuous monitoring

of involuntary physiological reactions. Measurements that can be obtained are heart rate,

galvanic skin response, respiration, muscle tension, and body temperature, to name a few.

        There are a few different ways in which biofeedback can be administered. The first is

clinician-led. The clinician will actively guide the patient through a relaxation monologue,

encouraging the patient to relax muscles associated near the pain region (or within the entire

body). While going through the monologue, the clinician is provided with real-time feedback

about the patient’s physiological response. Research studies have routinely supported the use of

biofeedback, particularly for those with pain and headaches that have not been responsive to

pharmacological interventions (McKenna et al., 2015).

                                                 8-23
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


        Another option of biofeedback is through computer programs developed by

psychologists. The most common, a program called Wild Devine (now Unyte) is an integrative

relaxation program that encourages the use of breathing techniques while simultaneously

measuring the patient’s physiological responses. This type of programming is especially helpful

for younger patients as there are various “games” the child can play that requires the awareness

and control of their thoughts, feelings, and emotions.

        8.6.2.3. Hypnosis. Hypnosis, which some argue is just an extreme sense of relaxation,

has been effective in reducing pain and managing anxiety symptoms associated with medical

procedures (Lang et al., 2000). Through extensive training, an individual can learn to engage in

self-hypnosis or obtain recorded hypnosis monologues to assist with the management of

physiological symptoms outside of hypnosis sessions. While additional research is still needed

within the field of hypnosis, studies have indicated that hypnosis is effective in not only treating

chronic pain, but also assists with a reduction in anxiety, improved sleep, and improved overall

quality of life. (Jensen et al., 2006).

        8.6.2.4. Group Therapy. Group therapy is another effective treatment option for

individuals with psychological distress related to physical disorders. These groups not only aim

to reduce the negative emotions associated with chronic illnesses, but they also provide support

from other group members that are experiencing the same physical and psychological symptoms.

These groups are typically CBT based, and utilize cognitive and behavioral strategies in a group

setting to encourage acceptance of disease while also addressing maladaptive coping strategies.

       •   Describe how OCD presents.

       •   Describe how BDD presents.

       •   Describe how hoarding presents.




9.1.1. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

       Obsessive-compulsive disorder, more commonly known as OCD, requires the presence

of both obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are defined as repetitive and persistent

thoughts, urges, or images. These obsessions are intrusive, time-consuming, and unwanted, often

causing significant distress in an individual’s daily functioning. Common obsessions are

contamination (dirt on self or objects), errors of uncertainty regarding daily behaviors (locking

the door, turning off appliances), thoughts of physical harm or violence, and orderliness, to name

a few (Cisler, Adams, et al., 2011; Yadin & Foa, 2009). Often the individual will try to ignore

these thoughts, urges, or images. When they are unable to ignore them, the individual will

engage in compulsatory behaviors to alleviate the anxiety.

       Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual performs in

response to an obsession. Common examples of compulsions are checking (e.g., repeatedly

checking if the stove is turned off even though the first four-times they checked it was), counting

(e.g., flicking the lights off and on exactly five times), hand washing, symmetry, or repeating

specific words (APA, 2013). These compulsive behaviors essentially alleviate the anxiety
                                                9-3
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


associated with the obsessive thoughts. For example, an individual may feel as though their

hands are dirty after using utensils at a restaurant. They may obsess over this thought for some

time, impacting their ability to interact with others or complete a specific task. This obsession

will ultimately lead to the individual performing a compulsion where they will wash their hands

with extremely hot water to rid all the germs, or even wash their hands a specified number of

times if they also have a counting compulsion. At this point, the individual’s anxiety should be

temporarily relieved.

       These obsessions and compulsions are more excessive than the typical “cleanliness” as

they consume a large part of the individual’s day. Additionally, they cause significant

impairment in one’s daily functioning. Given the example above, an individual with a fear of

contamination may refuse to eat at restaurants, or they may bring their utensils from home.



9.1.2. Body Dysmorphic Disorder

       Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is another obsessive disorder; however, the focus of

these obsessions is with perceived defects or flaws in their physical appearance. A key feature of

these obsessions is that they are not observable to others. An individual who has a congenital

facial defect or a burn victim who is concerned about their scars are not examples of an

individual with BDD. The obsessions related to one’s appearance can run the spectrum from

feeling “unattractive” to “looking hideous.” While any part of the body can be a concern for an

individual with BDD, the most commonly reported areas are skin (acne, wrinkles, skin color),

hair (particularly thinning or excessive body hair), and nose size (APA, 2013).

       Due to the distressing nature of the obsessions regarding one’s body, individuals with

BDD also engage in compulsive behaviors that take up a considerable amount of time in one’s

                                                9-4

day. For example, one may repeatedly compare their body to other people’s bodies in the general

public; frequently look at themselves in the mirror; engage in excessive grooming, which

includes using make-up to modify their appearance. Some individuals with BDD will go as far as

having numerous plastic surgeries in attempts to obtain their “perfect” appearance. While most

of us are guilty of engaging in some of these behaviors, to meet criteria for BDD, one must spend

a considerable amount of time preoccupied with their appearance (i.e., on average 3-8 hours a

day), as well as display significant impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of

functioning (APA, 2013).

       9.1.2.1. Muscle Dysmorphia. While muscle dysmorphia is not a formal diagnosis, it is a

common type of BDD, particularly within the male population. Muscle dysmorphia refers to the

belief that one’s body is too small or lacks the appropriate amount of muscle definition (Ahmed,

Cook, Genen & Schwartz, 2014). While the severity of BDD between individuals with and

without muscle dysmorphia appears to be the same, some studies have found higher use of

substance abuse (i.e., steroid use), poorer quality of life, and increased reports of suicide attempts

in those with muscle dysmorphia (Pope, Pope, Menard, Fay Olivardia, & Philips, 2005).



9.1.3. Hoarding

       Thanks to popular television shows, most of us have had some exposure to hoarding

disorder, even if it has only been through commercials. In hoarding, the key feature is the

persistent over-accumulation of possessions (APA, 2013). While we all obtain items throughout

our life, individuals with hoarding disorder continue to accumulate items without discarding

possessions, regardless of their value or sentiment. This lack of discarding occurs over a long

period and is not explained by a recent significant stressor (e.g., lost house in fire, so now keeps

                                                 9-5

everything). For example, last week’s newspaper that had no relevance to me or any historical

value, but those with hoarding disorder would keep this newspaper despite the lack of value or

sentiment.

       The most commonly hoarded items are newspapers, magazines, clothes, bags, books,

mail, and paperwork (APA, 2013). While these items may be stored in attics and garages,

individuals with a hoarding disorder also have these items cluttering their living space,

sometimes to the extent that they are unable to utilize their furniture because it is covered in

stuff. Cognitive factors contributing to the need to hold onto these non-sentimental items are fear

of losing valuable information and fear of being wasteful. When asked to “clean out” their house

or get rid of these items, individuals with hoarding disorder experience significant distress. One’s

hoarding behaviors also impacts their daily functioning and causes impairment in social and

occupational functioning.

                                      9.2. Epidemiology



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the epidemiology of OCD.

       •   Describe the epidemiology of BDD.

       •   Describe the epidemiology of hoarding.



9.2.1. OCD

       The prevalence rate for OCD is approximately 1.2% both in the US and worldwide

(APA, 2013). Similar to other anxiety-related disorders, women are diagnosed with OCD more

often than males; however, in childhood, boys are diagnosed more frequently than girls (APA,

2013). With respect to gender and symptoms, females are more likely to be diagnosed with

cleaning related obsessions and compulsions. In contrast, males are more likely to display

symptoms related to forbidden thoughts and symmetry (APA, 2013). Additionally, males have

an earlier age of onset (5-15 yrs.) compared to women (20-24 yrs.; Rasmussen & Eisen, 1990).

Approximately two-thirds of all individuals with OCD had some symptoms present before the

age of 15 (Rasmussen & Eisen, 1990).



9.2.2. BDD

       The point prevalence rate for BDD among US adults is 2.4% (APA, 2013).

Internationally, this rate drops to 1.7%-1.8% (APA, 2013). Despite the difference between the

national and international prevalence rates, the symptoms across races and cultures appear

similar.

       Gender-based prevalence rates indicate that women are more likely to be diagnosed with

BDD than males (2.5% females, 2.2% males; APA, 2013). While the diagnosis rates may be

different, general symptoms of BDD appear to be the same across genders with one exception:

males tend to report genital preoccupations while females are more likely to present with a

comorbid eating disorder.



9.2.3. Hoarding

       While national studies on the prevalence rate of hoarding within the US and

internationally are not available, surveys estimate clinically significant hoarding as occurring in

2-6% of the population (APA, 2013; Gilliam & Tolin, 2010). Epidemiological studies suggest

that males report a higher incidence of hoarding behaviors; however, clinical samples are more

highly represented by females. What does this mean? Either epidemiological studies are skewed,

or females seek out treatment for hoarding more often than males. Additionally, older individuals

(between ages 55-94) are three times more likely to be diagnosed with hoarding disorder than

younger adults.

       You should have learned the following in this section:
           •   The prevalence rate for OCD is about 1.2% while BDD is 2.4% and hoarding
               is estimated at 2-6%.
           •   In terms of gender, more males are diagnosed with OCD and are thought to
               have hoarding disorder though clinical samples are more highly represented
               by females likely due to their greater likelihood to seek treatment. More
               females are diagnosed with BDD.



       Section 9.2 Review Questions

           1. What are the key gender differences in prevalence rates and presentation of
              symptoms for individuals with OCD?
           2. What are some of the explanations regarding the lack of information regarding
              prevalence rates in hoarding disorder?




                                       9.3. Comorbidity

       •   Describe the comorbidity of OCD.

       •   Describe the comorbidity of BDD.

       •   Describe the comorbidity of hoarding.



9.3.1. OCD

       There is a high comorbidity rate between OCD and other anxiety disorders. Nearly 76%

of individuals with OCD will be diagnosed with another anxiety disorder, most commonly panic

disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or a specific phobia (APA, 2013).



                                               9-10
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


Additionally, due to the nature of OCD and its symptoms, nearly 41% of those with OCD will

also be diagnosed with a major depressive episode (APA, 2013).

       There is a high comorbidity rate between OCD and tic disorder, particularly in males

with an onset of OCD in childhood. Children presenting with early-onset OCD typically have a

different presentation of symptoms than traditional OCD. Research has also indicated a strong

triad of OCD, Tic disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children. Due to this

psychological disorder triad, it is believed there is a neurobiological mechanism at fault for the

development and maintenance of the disorders.

       It should be noted that there are several disorders—schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,

eating disorders, and Tourette’s—where there is a higher incidence of OCD than the general

public (APA, 2013). Therefore, clinicians who have a patient diagnosed with one of the disorders

above should also routinely assess patients for OCD.



9.3.2. BDD

       While research on BDD is still in its infancy, initial studies suggest that major depressive

disorder is the most common comorbid psychological disorder (APA, 2013). MDD typically

occurs after the onset of BDD. Additionally, there are some reports of social anxiety, OCD, and

substance-related disorders (likely related to muscle enhancement; APA, 2013).



9.3.3. Hoarding

       Hoarding has an extremely high comorbidity rate with other mood and anxiety disorders,

with approximately 75% of individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for either major depressive

disorder, social anxiety disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder (APA, 2013). Additionally,

                                                9-11

nearly 20% also meet the criteria for OCD, which is not surprising seeing the similarity in their

etiology.



    You should have learned the following in this section:
       •    OCD is shown to have a high comorbidity with anxiety and depressive
            disorders as well as Tic disorder and ADHD in children.
       •    BDD has a high comorbidity with major depressive disorder.
       •    Hoarding has a high comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders.

Section Learning Objectives

       •      Describe the biological causes of obsessive-compulsive disorders.

       •      Describe the cognitive causes of obsessive-compulsive disorders.

       •      Describe the behavioral causes of obsessive-compulsive disorders.



9.4.1. Biological

       There are a few biological explanations for obsessive-compulsive related disorders,

including hereditary transmission, neurotransmitter deficits, and abnormal functioning in brain

structures.

       9.4.1.1. Hereditary transmission. With regards to heritability studies, twin studies

routinely support the role of genetics in the development of obsessive-compulsive behaviors, as

monozygotic twins have a substantially greater concordance rate (80-87%) than dizygotic twins

(47-50%; Carey & Gottesman, 1981; van Grootheest, Cath, Beekman, & Boomsma, 2005).

Additionally, first degree relatives of patients diagnosed with OCD are at a 5-fold increase to

develop OCD at some point throughout their lifespan (Nestadt, et al., 2000).

       Interestingly, a study conducted by Nestadt and colleagues (2000) exploring the familial

role in the development of obsessive-compulsive disorder found that family members of

individuals with OCD had higher rates of both obsessions and compulsions than control families;

however, the familial relationship with regards to obsessions were stronger than that of

compulsions suggesting that there is a stronger heritability association for obsessions than

       This study also found a relationship between age of onset of OCD symptoms and family

heritability. Individuals who experienced an earlier age of onset, particularly before age 17, were

found to have more first-degree relatives diagnosed with OCD. In fact, after the age of 17, there

was no relationship between family diagnoses, suggesting those who develop OCD at an older

age may have a different diagnostic origin (Nestadt, et al., 2000).

       Initial studies exploring genetic factors for BDD and hoarding also indicate a hereditary

influence; however, environmental factors appear to play a more significant role in the

development of these disorders than that of OCD (Ahmed, et al., 2014; Lervolino et al., 2009).

       9.4.1.2. Neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin, have been

identified as a contributing factor to obsessive and compulsive behaviors. This discovery was

made accidentally, when individuals with depression and comorbid OCD were given

antidepressant medications clomipramine and fluoxetine—both of which increase levels of

serotonin—to mediate symptoms of depression. Not only did these patients report a significant

reduction in their depressive symptoms, but also a substantial improvement in their OCD

symptoms (Bokor & Anderson, 2014). Interestingly enough, antidepressant medications that do

not affect serotonin levels are not effective in managing obsessive and compulsive symptoms,

thus offering additional support for deficits of serotonin levels as an explanation of obsessive and

compulsive behaviors (Sinopoli, Burton, Kronenberg, & Arnold, 2017; Bokor & Anderson,

2014). More recently, there has been some research implicating the involvement of additional

neurotransmitters—glutamate, GABA, and dopamine—in the development and maintenance of

OCD, although future studies are still needed to draw definitive conclusions (Marinova, Chuang,

& Fineberg, 2017).

       9.4.1.3. Brain structures. Seeing as neurotransmitters have direct involvement in the

development of obsessive-compulsive behaviors, it’s only logical that brain structures that house

these neurotransmitters also likely play a role in symptom development. Neuroimaging studies

implicate the brain structures and circuits in the frontal lobe, more specifically, the orbitofrontal

cortex, which is located just above each eye (Marsh et al., 2014). This brain region is responsible

for mediating strong emotional responses and converts them into behavioral responses. Once the

orbitofrontal cortex receives sensory/emotional information via sensory inputs, it transmits this

information through impulses. These impulses are then passed on to the caudate nuclei, which

filters through the many impulses received, passing along only the strongest impulses to the

thalamus. Once the impulses reach the thalamus, the individual essentially reassesses the

emotional response and decides whether or not to act (Beucke et al., 2013). It is believed that

individuals with obsessive compulsive behaviors experience overactivity of the orbitofrontal

cortex and a lack of filtering in the caudate nuclei, thus causing too many impulses to transfer to

the thalamus (Endrass et al., 2011). Further support for this theory has been shown when

individuals with OCD experience brain damage to the orbitofrontal cortex or caudate nuclei and

experience remission of OCD symptoms (Hofer et al., 2013).



9.4.2. Cognitive

       Cognitive theorists believe that OCD behaviors occur due to an individual’s distorted

thinking and negative cognitive biases. More specifically, individuals with OCD are more likely

to overestimate the probability of harm, loss of control, or uncertainty in their life, thus leading

them to over-interpret potential negative outcomes of events. Additionally, some research has

indicated that those with OCD also experience disconfirmation bias, which causes the individual

                                                9-15

to seek out evidence of their failure to perform the ritual or compensatory behavior correctly

(Sue, Sue, Sue, & Sue, 2017). Finally, individuals with OCD often report the inability to trust

themselves and their instincts, and therefore, feel the need to repeat the compulsive behavior

multiple times to ensure it is done correctly. These cognitive biases are supported throughout

research studies that repeatedly find individuals with OCD experience more intrusive thoughts

than those without OCD (Jacob, Larson, & Storch, 2014).

       We have identified that individuals with OCD experience cognitive biases and that these

biases contribute to the obsessive and compulsive behaviors, but why do these cognitive biases

occur so often? Everyone has times when they have repetitive or intrusive thoughts such as: “Did

I shut the oven off after cooking dinner?” or “Did I remember to lock the door before I left

home?” Fortunately, most individuals are able to either concede to their thoughts once, or even

forgo acknowledging their thoughts after they confidently talk themselves through their actions,

ensuring that the behavior in question was or was not completed. Unfortunately, individuals with

OCD are unable to neutralize these thoughts without performing a ritual as a way to put

themselves at ease. As you will see in more detail in the behavioral section below, the behaviors

(compulsions) used to neutralize the thoughts (obsessions) provide temporary relief to the

individual. As the individual is continually exposed to the obsession and repeatedly engages in

the compulsive behaviors to neutralize their anxiety, the behavior is repeatedly reinforced, thus

becoming a compulsion. This theory is supported by studies where individuals with OCD report

using more neutralizing strategies and report significant reductions in anxiety after employing

these neutralizing techniques (Jacob, Larson, & Storch, 2014; Salkovskis et al., 2003).

9.4.3. Behavioral

       The behavioral explanation of obsessive compulsive-related disorders focuses on

compulsions rather than obsessions. Behaviorists believe that these compulsions begin with and

are maintained through classical conditioning. As you may remember, classical conditioning

occurs when an unconditioned stimulus is paired with a conditioned stimulus to produce a

conditioned response. How does this explain OCD? Well, an individual with OCD may

experience negative thoughts or anxieties related to an unpleasant event (obsession;

unconditioned stimulus). These thoughts/anxieties cause significant distress to the individual,

and therefore, they seek out some behavior (compulsion) to alleviate these threats (conditioned

stimulus). This provides temporary relief to the individual, thus reinforcing the compulsive

behaviors used to lessen the threat. Over time, the conditioned stimulus (compulsive behaviors)

are reinforced due to the repeated exposure of the obsession and the temporary relief that comes

with engaging in these compulsive behaviors.

       Strong support for this theory is the fact that the behavioral treatment option for OCD-

exposure and response prevention, is among the most effective treatments for these disorders. As

you will read below, this treatment essentially breaks the patient’s classical conditioning

associated with the obsessions and compulsions by preventing the individual from engaging in

the conditioned stimulus until anxiety is reduced.

9.5.1. OCD

       9.5.1.1. Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). Treatment of OCD has come a

long way in recent years. Among the most effective treatment options is exposure and response

prevention (March, Frances, Kahn, & Carpenter, 1997). First developed by psychiatrist Victor

Meyer (1966), as you might infer from the name, individuals are repeatedly exposed to their

obsession, thus causing anxiety/fears, while simultaneously prevented from engaging in their

compulsive behaviors. Exposure sessions are often done in vivo (in real life), via videos, or even

imaginary, depending on the type of obsession. For example, a fear that one’s house would burn

down if their compulsion was not carried out would obviously be done via imaginary exposure,

as it would not be ethical to have a person burn their house down.

       Prior to beginning the exposure and response prevention exercises, the clinician must

teach the patient relaxation techniques for them to engage in during the distress of being exposed

to the obsession. Once relaxation techniques are taught, the clinician and patient will develop a

hierarchy of obsessions. Treatment will start at those with the lowest amount of distress to ensure

the patient has success with treatment, as well as preventing withdrawal of treatment.



                                               9-19
                                                                    2nd edition as of August 2020


       Within the hierarchy of obsessions, the individual is also gradually exposed to their

obsession. For example, an individual obsessed with germs, may first watch a person sneeze on

the computer in session. Once anxiety is managed and compulsions refrain at this level of

exposure, the individual would move on to being present in the same room as a sick individual,

to eventually shaking hands with someone obviously sick, each time preventing them from

engaging in their compulsive behavior. Once this level of their hierarchy was managed, they

would move on to the next obsession and so forth until the entire list was complete.

       Treatment outcome for exposure and response prevention is very effective in treating

individuals with OCD. In fact, some studies suggest up to an 86% response rate when treatment

is completed (Foa et al., 2005). Combination treatments such as ERP with family counseling

(utilizing CBT techniques) may actually increase this response rate even higher (Bolleau, 2011;

Krebs & Heyman, 2015). Like most OCD related treatments, the largest barrier to treatment is

getting patients to commit to treatment, as the repeated exposures and prevention of compulsive

behaviors can be extremely distressing to patients.

       9.5.1.2. Psychopharmacology. There has been minimal support for the treatment of

OCD with medication alone. This is likely due to the temporary resolution of symptoms during

medication use. Among the most effective medications are those that inhibit the reuptake of

serotonin, clomipramine and SSRIs. Reportedly, up to 60% of patients show improvement in

symptoms while taking these medications; however, symptoms are quick to return when

medications are discontinued (Dougherty, Rauch, & Jenike, 2002). While there has been some

promise in a combined treatment option of exposure and response prevention and SSRIs, these

findings were not superior to exposure and response prevention alone, suggesting that the

inclusion of medication in treatment does not provide an added benefit (Foa et al., 2005).

                                               9-20

9.5.2. BDD

         Seeing as though there are strong similarities between OCD and BDD, it should not come

as a surprise that the only two effective treatments for BDD are those that are effective in OCD.

Exposure and response prevention has been successful in treating symptoms of BDD, as patients

are repeatedly exposed to their body imperfections/obsessions and prevented from engaging in

compulsions used to reduce their anxiety. (Veale, Gournay, et al., 1996; Wilhelm, Otto, Lohr, &

Deckersbach, 1999). The other treatment option, psychopharmacology, has also been shown to

reduce symptoms in patients with BDD. Similar to OCD, medications such as clomipramine and

SSRIs are generally prescribed. While these are effective in reducing BDD symptoms, once

medication is discontinued, symptoms resume nearly immediately suggesting this is not an

effective long-term treatment option for those with BDD.

         Treatment of BDD appears to be difficult, with one study finding that only 9% of

participants had full remission at a 1-year follow-up, and 21% reported partial remission

(Phillips, Pagano, Menard & Stout, 2006). A more recent finding reported more promising

findings, with 76% of participants reporting full remission over 8 years (Bjornsson, Dyck, et al.,

2011).

         9.5.2.1. Plastic surgery and medical treatments. Many individuals with BDD seek out

plastic surgery to attempt to correct their deficits. Phillips and colleagues (2001) evaluated

treatments of patients with BDD and found that 76.4% of the patients reported some form of

plastic surgery or medical treatment, with dermatology treatment the most reported (45%)

followed by plastic surgery (23%). The problem with this type of treatment is that the individual

is rarely satisfied with the outcome of the procedure, thus leading them to seek out additional

surgeries on the same defect (Phillips et al., 2001). Therefore, it is important that medical

                                                9-21

professionals thoroughly screen patients for psychological distress before completing any

medical treatment.



9.5.3. Hoarding

       Recent research has concluded that unlike OCD, many individuals with hoarding disorder

do not experience intrusive thoughts, nor do they experience urges to perform rituals. Because of

this difference, treatment for hoarding disorder has moved away from exposure and response

prevention, and more toward a traditional cognitive-behavioral approach.

       Frost and Hartl (1996) believed that individuals with hoarding disorder engage in

complex decision-making processes, overanalyzing the value and worth of possessions, thus

leading to hoarding the object as opposed to discarding it. Therefore, in addition to having the

individual engage in exposure treatment, an added component of cognitive restructuring and

motivational interviewing are added to address the complex-decision making that is involved in

maintaining unnecessary possessions. By discussing motives for keeping items, as well as fears

that may be associated with discarding items, clinicians can assist patients in their cognitive

processes to ultimately determine the item’s actual worth (Williams & Viscusi, 2016).

Unfortunately, due to the distressing nature of having to discard their possessions, many

individuals in treatment for hoarding disorder prematurely end treatment, thus never reaching

remission of symptoms (Mancebo, Eisen, Sibrava, Dyck, & Rasmussen, 2011).

     You should have learned the following in this section:
        •   Treatment options for OCD include exposure and response prevention, as
            well as SSRIs though the drug does not provide an added benefit in
            treatment.
        •   Treatment options for BDD include exposure and response prevention and
            drugs clomipramine and SSRIs.

            restructuring, and motivational interviewing.

        •   Describe how Bulimia Nervosa presents.

        •   Describe how Binge-Eating Disorder (BED) presents.



        Eating disorders are very serious, yet relatively common mental health disorders,

particularly in Western society, where there is a heavy emphasis on thinness and physical

appearance. In fact, 13% of adolescents will be diagnosed with at least one eating disorder by

their 20th birthday (Stice, Marti, & Rohde, 2013). Furthermore, a large number of adolescents

will engage in significant disordered eating behaviors just below the clinical threshold (Culbert,

Burt, McGue, Iacono & Klump, 2009).

        While there is no exact cause for eating disorders, the combination of biological,

psychological, and sociocultural factors have been identified as major contributors in both the

development and maintenance of eating disorders. This chapter serves as an introduction to three

of the most common eating disorders, their etiology, and treatment.

        Within the DSM-5 (APA, 2013), there are six disorders classified under the Feeding and

Eating Disorders section: Pica, Rumination Disorder, Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder,

Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, and Binge-Eating Disorder. For this book, we will cover

the latter three.

        Diagnostic criteria for eating disorders are mutually exclusive, meaning that only one of

these diagnoses can be assigned at any given time, except for Pica, which can be given as a
                                               10-3

diagnosis along with any of the aforementioned eating disorders. Given how similar many eating

disorders may present, it is important to review diagnostic criteria routinely to ensure the most

appropriate diagnosis has been made.



10.1.1. Anorexia Nervosa

       Anorexia nervosa involves the restriction of food, which leads to significantly low body

weight relative to the individual's age, sex, and development. This restriction is often secondary

to an intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, despite the individual's low body weight.

Altered perception of self and an over-evaluation of one's body weight and shape contribute to

this disturbance of body size (National Eating Disorder Association).

       Typical warning signs and symptoms of an individual with anorexia nervosa are divided

into two different categories: Emotional/Behavioral and Physical. Some emotional and

behavioral symptoms include dramatic weight loss, preoccupation with food, weight, calories,

etc., frequent comments about feeling "fat," eating a restricted range of foods, makes excuses to

avoid mealtimes, and often does not eat in public. Physical changes may include dizziness,

difficulty concentrating, feeling cold, sleep problems, thinning hair/hair loss, and muscle

weakness, to name a few.

       The onset of the disorder typically begins with mild dietary restrictions such as

eliminating carbs or specific fatty foods. As weight loss is achieved, the dietary restrictions

progress to more severe, e.g., under 500 calories/day. While symptoms typically present in mid-

teenage years, there is a noticeable trend of younger girls—as young as eight years old—who

exhibit extreme dietary restrictive behaviors. While males are not immune to this disorder, the

number of females diagnosed each year is overwhelmingly larger than that of males.

10.1.2. Bulimia Nervosa

       Unlike anorexia nervosa where there is solely restriction of food, bulimia nervosa

involves a pattern of recurrent binge eating behaviors. Binge eating can be defined as a discrete

period of time where the amount of food consumed is significantly more than most people would

eat during a similar time period. Individuals with bulimia nervosa often report a sense of lack of

control over-eating during these binge-eating episodes. While not always, these binge-eating

episodes are usually followed by a feeling of disgust with oneself, which leads to

a compensatory behavior in an attempt to rid the body of the excessive calories. These

compensatory behaviors include vomiting, use of laxatives, fasting (or severe restriction), or

excessive exercise. This cycle of binge eating and compensatory behaviors occurs on average, at

least once a week for three months (National Eating Disorder Association).

       It is important to note that while there are periods of severe calorie restriction like

anorexia, the two disorders cannot be diagnosed simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to

determine if an individual engages in a binge-eating episode—if they do, they do not meet the

criteria for anorexia nervosa.

       Signs and symptoms of bulimia nervosa are similar to anorexia nervosa. These symptoms

include but are not limited to hiding food wrappers or containers after a bingeing episode, feeling

uncomfortable eating in public, developing food rituals, limited diet, disappearing to the

bathroom after eating a meal, and drinking excessive amounts of water or non-caloric beverages.

Additional physical changes include weight fluctuations both up and down, difficulty

concentrating, dizziness, sleep disturbance, and possible dental problems due to purging post

binge eating episode.

       Symptoms of bulimia nervosa typically present later in development- late adolescence or

early adulthood. Similar to anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa initially presents with mild

restrictive dietary behaviors; however, episodes of binge eating interrupt the dietary restriction,

causing bodyweight to rise around normal levels. In response to weight gain, patients engage in

compensatory behaviors or purging episodes to reduce body weight. This cycle of restriction,

binge eating, and calorie reduction often occurs for years before seeking help.



10.1.3. Binge-Eating Disorder (BED)

       Binge-Eating Disorder is similar to Bulimia Nervosa in that it involves recurrent binge

eating episodes along with feelings of lack of control during the binge-eating episode; however,

these episodes are not followed by a compensatory behavior to rid the body of calories. Despite

the feelings of shame and guilt post-binge, individuals with BED will not engage in vomiting,

excessive exercises, or other compensatory behaviors. These binge eating episodes occur on

average, at least once a week for 3 months.

       Because these binge-eating episodes occur without compensatory behaviors, individuals

with BED are at risk for obesity and related health disorders. Individuals with BED report

feelings of embarrassment at the quantity of food consumed, and thus will often refuse to eat in

public. Due to the restriction of eating around others, individuals with BED often engage in

secret binge eating episodes in private, followed by discrete disposal of wrappers and containers.

       While much is still being researched about binge-eating disorder, current research

indicates that the onset of BED is later than that of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Most

patients are middle-aged, and approximately one third or more are male. Binge-eating disorder

also appears to be more phasic rather than persistent, with individuals experiencing significant

time periods where their binge-eating episodes are in control. The gender discrepancy in BED is

much smaller than that of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.




     You should have learned the following in this section:
        •   Anorexia nervosa involves the restriction of food, which leads to significantly
            low body weight relative to the individual's age, sex, and development, and an
            intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat.
        •   Bulimia nervosa is characterized by a pattern of recurrent binge eating
            behaviors.
        •   Binge-eating disorder is characterized by recurrent binge eating episodes along
            with a feeling of lack of control but no compensatory behavior to rid the body
            of the calories.

Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the epidemiology of eating disorders.



       According to the DSM-5 (APA, 2013), the prevalence rate for anorexia nervosa among

young women is 0.4%, whereas the prevalence rate for bulimia nervosa is 1%-1.5%. While BED

is still a relatively new diagnosis, the estimated prevalence rate in females is 1.6%. Prevalence

rates for males with anorexia or bulimia are unknown; however, research suggests the female-to-

male ratio is approximately 10:1 for both disorders (APA, 2015). The estimated prevalence rate

for BED in males is 0.8%. The ratio between females-to-males with BED is much less skewed

than that in anorexia and bulimia.



   You should have learned the following in this section:
       •   BED has the highest prevalence rate of 1.6% followed by bulimia nervosa at 1-
           1.5% and anorexia nervosa at 0.4%.
       •   Females are more likely to be diagnosed with anorexia or bulimia with an equal
           number presenting with BED.

Section Learning Objectives

   •   Describe the comorbidity of anorexia nervosa.

   •   Describe the comorbidity of bulimia nervosa.

   •   Describe the comorbidity of BED.



10.3.1. Anorexia

       Anorexia is rarely a single diagnosis. High rates of bipolar disorder, depressive

symptoms, and anxiety disorders are also common among individuals with anorexia nervosa.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder is more often seen in those with the restrictive type of anorexia

nervosa, whereas alcohol use disorder and other substance use disorders are more commonly

seen in those with anorexia who engage in binge-eating/purging behaviors. Unfortunately, there

is also a high rate of suicidality, as many as 12 per 100,000 per year (APA, 2013).



10.3.2. Bulimia

       The majority of individuals diagnosed with bulimia nervosa also present with at least one

other mental disorder. Similar to anorexia nervosa, there is also a high frequency of depressive

symptoms, as well as bipolar disorder. While some experience mood fluctuations as a result of

their eating pattern, a large number of individuals will identify mood symptoms prior to the onset

of bulimia nervosa (APA, 2013). Anxiety, particularly social anxiety, is often present in those

with bulimia nervosa. However, most mood and anxiety symptoms resolve once an effective

treatment of bulimia is established. Alcohol use, as well as substance abuse, is also prevalent in
                                               10-9

those with bulimia. The substance abuse tends to begin as a compensatory behavior (e.g.

stimulant use is used to control appetite and weight) and over time, as the eating disorder

progresses, so does the substance abuse. Finally, there is also a percentage of individuals with

bulimia nervosa who also display personality characteristics consistent with a range of

personality disorders.



10.3.3. BED

        Since BED is a new diagnosis, research regarding comorbidity with other mental

disorders is still developing. Preliminary evidence suggests that BED shares similar

comorbidities with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Common comorbidities include but

are not limited to bipolar disorder, depressive disorders, and anxiety disorders. Although there is

some evidence of comorbid substance abuse disorder, it is not as prevalent as that in bulimia

nervosa and anorexia nervosa.



 You should have learned the following in this section:
    •   Anorexia and BED have a high comorbidity with bipolar disorder, depressive
        symptoms, and anxiety disorders.
    •   Bulimia has a high comorbidity with bipolar disorder, depressive symptoms, social
        anxiety, and alcohol and substance abuse.

                                         10.4. Etiology



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the biological causes of eating disorders.

       •   Describe the cognitive causes of eating disorders.

       •   Describe the sociocultural causes of eating disorders.

       •   Describe how personality traits are the cause of eating disorders.



       What causes eating disorders? While researchers have yet to identify a specific cause of

eating disorders, the most compelling argument to date is that eating disorders are

multidimensional disorders. This means many contributing factors lead to the development of

an eating disorder. While there is likely a genetic predisposition, there are also environmental, or

external factors, such as family dynamics and cultural influences that impact their presentation.

Research supporting these influences is well documented for anorexia nervosa and bulimia

nervosa; however, seeing as BED has only just recently been established as a formal diagnosis,

research on the evolvement of BED is ongoing.



10.4.1. Biological

       There is some evidence of a genetic predisposition for eating disorders, with relatives of

those diagnosed with an eating disorder being up to six times more likely than other individuals

to be diagnosed also (APA, 2013). Twin concordance studies also support the gene theory. If an

identical twin is diagnosed with anorexia, there is a 70% percent chance the other twin will

develop anorexia in their lifetime (APA, 2013). The concordance rate for fraternal twins (who
                                               10-11
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


share less genes) is 20 percent. While not as strong for bulimia, identical twins still display a 23

percent concordance rate, compared to the 9 percent fraternal twins rate (APA, 2013).

       In addition to hereditary causes, disruption in the neuroendocrine system is common in

those with eating disorders (Culbert, Racine, & Klump, 2015). Unfortunately, it’s difficult for

researchers to determine if these disruptions caused the disorder or have been caused by the

disorder, as manipulation of eating patterns is known to trigger changes in hormone production.

With that said, researchers have explored the hypothalamus as a potential contributing factor.

The hypothalamus is responsible for regulating body functions, particularly hunger and thirst

(Fetissov & Mequid, 2010). Within the hypothalamus, the lateral hypothalamus is responsible for

initiating hunger cues that cause the organism to eat, whereas the ventromedial hypothalamus is

responsible for sending signals of satiation, telling the organism to stop eating. Clearly, a

disruption in either of these structures could explain why an individual may not take in enough

calories or experience periods of overeating.



10.4.2. Cognitive

       Some argue that eating disorders are, in fact, a variant of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

(OCD). The obsession with body shape and weight—the hallmark of an eating disorder—is

likely a driving factor in anorexia nervosa. Distorted thought patterns and an over-evaluation of

body size likely contribute to this obsession and one’s desire for thinness. Research has

identified high levels of impulsivity, particularly in those with binge eating episodes, suggesting

a temporary lack of control is responsible for these episodes. Post binge-eating episode, many

individuals report feelings of disgust or even thoughts of failure. These strong cognitive factors

                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


are indicative as to why cognitive-behavioral therapy is the preferred treatment for eating

disorders.



10.4.3. Sociocultural

       Eating disorders are overwhelmingly found in Western countries where there is a heavy

emphasis on thinness—a core feature of eating disorders. It is also found in countries where food

is in abundance, as in places of deprivation, round figures are viewed as more desirable (Polivy

& Herman, 2002). While eating disorders were once thought of as disorders of higher SES,

recent research suggests that as our country becomes more homogenized, the more universal

eating disorders become.

       10.4.3.1. Media. One commonly discussed contributor to eating disorders is the media.

The idealization of thin models and actresses sends the message to young women (and

adolescents) that to be popular and attractive, you must be thin. These images are not isolated to

magazines, but are also seen in television shows, movies, commercials, and large advertisements

on billboards and hanging in store windows. With the emergence of social media (e.g.,

Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram), exposure to media images and celebrities is even easier.

Couple this with the ability to alter images to make individuals even thinner, it is no wonder

many young people become dissatisfied with their body (Polivy & Herman, 2004).

       10.4.3.2. Ethnicity. While eating disorders are not solely a “white woman” disorder,

there are significant discrepancies when it comes to race, especially for anorexia nervosa. Why is

this? Research indicates that black men prefer heavier women than do white men (Greenberg &

Laporte, 1996). Given this preference, it should not be surprising that black women and children

have larger ideal physiques than their white peers (Polivy & Herman, 2000). Since black women

                                              10-13
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


are less driven to thinness, black women would appear to be likely to develop anorexia; however,

findings suggest this is not the case. Caldwell and colleagues (1997) found that high-income

black women were equally as dissatisfied as high-income white women with their physique,

suggesting body image issues may be more closely related to SES than that of race. The race

discrepancies are also less significant in BED, where the prominent feature of the eating disorder

is not thinness (Polivy & Herman, 2002).

       10.4.3.3. Gender. Males account for only a small percentage of eating disorders—

roughly 5-10% (APA, 2013). While it is unclear as to why there is such a discrepancy, it is likely

somewhat related to cultural desires of women being “thin” and men being “muscular” or

“strong.”

       Of men diagnosed with an eating disorder, the overwhelming percentage of them

identified a job or sport as the primary reason for their eating behaviors (Strother, Lemberg,

Stanford, & Turberville, 2012). Jockeys, distance runners, wrestlers, and bodybuilders are some

of the professions identified as most restrictive regarding body weight.

       There is some speculation that males are not diagnosed as frequently as women due to the

stigma attached to eating disorders. Eating disorders have routinely been characterized as a

“white, adolescent female” problem. Due to this bias, young men may not seek help for their

eating disorder in efforts to prevent labeling (Raevuoni, Keski-Rahkonen & Hoek, 2014).

       10.4.3.4. Family. Family influences are one of the strongest external contributors to

maintaining eating disorders. Often family members are praised for their slenderness. Think

about the last time you saw a family member or close friend- how often have you said, “You

look great!” or commented on their appearance in some way? The odds are pretty high. While

the intent of the family member is not to maintain maladaptive eating behaviors by praising the

                                              10-14
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


physical appearance of someone struggling with an eating disorder, they are indirectly

perpetuating the disorder.

       While family involvement can help maintain the disorder, it can also contribute to the

development of an eating disorder. Families that emphasize thinness or place a large emphasis on

physical appearance are more likely to have a child diagnosed with an eating disorder (Zerbe,

2008). In fact, mothers with eating disorders are more likely to have children who develop a

feeding/eating disorder than mothers without eating disorders (Whelan & Cooper, 2000).

Additional family characteristics that are common among patients receiving treatment for eating

disorders are enmeshed, intrusive, critical, hostile, or overly concerned with parenting (Polivy &

Herman, 2002). While there has been some correlation between these family dynamics and

eating disorders, they are not evident in all families of people with eating disorders.



10.4.4. Personality

       There are many personality characteristics that are common in individuals with eating

disorders. While it is unknown if these characteristics are inherent in the individual’s personality

or a product of personal experiences, the thought is eating disorders develop due to the

combination of the two.

       10.4.4.1. Perfectionism. It should come as no surprise that perfectionism, or the belief

that one must be perfect, is a contributing factor to disorders related to eating, weight, and body

shape (particularly anorexia nervosa). While an exact mechanism is unknown, it is believed that

perfectionism magnifies normal body imperfections, leading an individual to go to extreme (i.e.,

restrictive) behaviors to remedy the flaw (Hewitt, Flett & Ediger, 1995).



                                               10-15

       10.4.4.2. Self-Esteem. Self-esteem, or one’s belief in their worth or ability, has routinely

been identified as a moderator of many psychological disorders, and eating disorders are no

exception. Low self-esteem not only contributes to the development of an eating disorder but is

also likely involved in the maintenance of the disorder. One theory, the transdiagnostic model

of eating disorders, suggests that overall low self-esteem increases the risk for over-evaluation of

body, which in turn, leads to negative eating behaviors that could lead to an eating disorder

(Fairburn, Cooper & Shafran, 2003).

         •   Biological causes of eating disorders include a genetic predisposition and
             disruption in the neuroendocrine system.

         •   The personality trait of perfectionism and low self-esteem are contributing
             factors to disorders related to eating, weight, and body shape.

       •    Describe treatment options for bulimia nervosa.

       •    Describe treatment options for binge eating disorder.

       •    Discuss the outcome of treatment for eating disorders.



10.5.1. Anorexia

       The immediate goal for the treatment of anorexia nervosa is weight gain and recovery

from malnourishment. This is often established via an intensive outpatient program, or if needed,

through an inpatient hospitalization program where caloric intake can be managed and

controlled. Both the inpatient and outpatient programs use a combination of therapies and

support to help restore proper eating habits. Of the most common (and successful) treatments are

Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Family-Based Therapy (FBT).

       10.5.1.1. CBT. Because anorexia nervosa requires changes to both eating behaviors as

well as thought patterns, CBT strategies have been very effective in producing lasting changes to

those suffering from anorexia nervosa. Some of the behavioral strategies include recording

eating behaviors—hunger pains, quality and quantity of food—and emotional behaviors—

feelings related to the food. In addition to these behavioral strategies, it is also important to

address the maladaptive thought patterns associated with their negative body image and desire to

control their physical characteristics. Changing the fear related to gaining weight is essential in

recovery.

       10.5.1.2. FBT. FBT is also an effective treatment approach, often used as a component of

individual CBT, especially for children and adolescents with the disorder. FBT has been shown

to elicit 50-60% of weight restoration in one year, as well as weight maintenance 2-4 years post-

treatment (Campbell & Peebles, 2014; LeGrange, Lock, Accurso, Agras, Darcy, Forsberg, et al,

2014). Additionally, FBT has been shown to improve rapid weight gain, produce fewer

hospitalizations, and is more cost-effective than other types of therapies with family involvement

(Agras, Lock, Brandt, Bryson, Dodge, Halmi, et al., 2014).

       FBT typically involves 16-18 sessions which are divided into 3 phases: (1) Parents take

charge of weight restoration, (2) client’s gradual control overeating, and (3) address

developmental issues including fostering autonomy from parents (Chen, et al., 2016). While FBT

has shown to be effective in treating adolescents with anorexia nervosa, the application for older

eating patients (i.e., college-aged students and above) is still undetermined. As with adolescents,

the goal for a family-based treatment program should center around helping the patient separate

their feelings and needs from that of their family.



10.5.2. Bulimia

       Just as anorexia nervosa treatment initially focuses on weight gain, the first goal of

bulimia nervosa treatment is to eliminate binge eating episodes and compensatory behaviors. The

aim is to replace both of these negative behaviors with positive eating habits. One of the most

effective ways to establish this is through Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).

       10.5.2.1. CBT. Similar to anorexia nervosa, individuals with bulimia nervosa are

expected to keep a journal of their eating habits; however, with bulimia nervosa, it is also

important that the journal include changes in sensations of hunger and fullness, as well as other

                                               10-18
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


feelings surrounding their eating patterns in efforts to identify triggers to their binging episodes

(Agras, Fitzsimmons-Craft & Wilfley, 2017). Once these triggers are identified, psychologists

will utilize specific behavioral or cognitive techniques to prevent the individual from engaging in

binge episodes or compensatory behaviors.

        One method for modifying behaviors is through Exposure and Response Prevention. As

previously discussed in the OCD chapter, this treatment is very effective in helping individuals

stop performing their compulsive behaviors by literally preventing them from engaging in the

action, while simultaneously using relaxation strategies to reduce anxiety associated with not

engaging in the negative behavior. Therefore, to prevent an individual from purging post-binge

episodes, the individual would be encouraged to partake in an activity that directly competes

with their ability to purge, e.g., write their thoughts and feelings in a journal at the kitchen table.

Research has indicated that this treatment is particularly helpful for individuals suffering from

comorbid anxiety disorders (particularly OCD; Agras, Fitzsimmons-Craft & Wilfley, 2017).

        In addition to changing behaviors, it is also important to change the maladaptive thoughts

toward food, eating, weight, and shape. Negative thoughts such as “I am fat” and “I can’t stop

eating when I start” can be modified into more appropriate thoughts such as “My body is

healthy” or “I can control my eating habits.” By replacing these negative thoughts with more

appropriate, positive thought patterns, individuals begin to control their feelings, which in return,

can help them manage their behaviors.

        10.5.2.2. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT). IPT has also been established as an

effective treatment for those with bulimia nervosa, particularly if an individual has not been

successful with CBT treatment. The goal of IPT is to improve interpersonal functioning in those

with eating disorders. Originally a treatment for depression, IPT-E was adapted to address the

                                                 10-19
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


social isolation and self-esteem problems that contribute to the maintenance of negative eating

behaviors.

       IPT-E has 3 phases typically covered in weekly sessions over 4-5 months. Phase One

consists of engaging the patient in treatment and providing psychoeducation about their disease

and the treatment program. This phase also includes identifying interpersonal problems that are

maintaining the disease.

       Phase Two is the main treatment component. In this phase, the primary focus is on

problem-solving interpersonal issues. The most common types of interpersonal issues are lack of

intimacy and interpersonal deficits, interpersonal role disputes, role transitions, grief, and life

goals. Once the main interpersonal problem is identified, the clinician supports the patient in

their pursuit to identify ways to change. A key component of IPT-E is the supportive role of the

clinician, as opposed to the teaching role in other treatments. The idea is that by having the

patient make changes, they can better understand their problems, and as a result, make more

profound changes (Murphy, Straebler, Basden, Cooper, & Fairburn, 2012).

       Phase Three is the final stage. The goals of this phase are to ensure that the changes made

in phase two are maintained. To achieve this, treatment sessions are spaced out, allowing patients

more time to engage in their changed behavior. Additionally, relapse prevention (i.e., problem-

solving ways not to relapse) is also discussed to ensure long term results. In doing this, the

patient reviews the progress they have made throughout treatment, as well as identifying

potential interpersonal issues that may arise, and how their treatment can be adapted to address

those issues.

       Support for IPT-E is limited; however, two extensive studies suggest that IPT-E is

effective in treating bulimia nervosa, and possibly BED. While treatment is initially slower than

CBT, it is equally effective in long-term follow-up and maintenance of disorder (Fairburn,

Marcus, & Wilson, 1993).



10.5.3. Binge Eating Disorder

       Given the similar presentations of BED and bulimia nervosa, it should not be surprising

that the most effective treatments for BED are similar to that of bulimia nervosa. CBT, along

with antidepressant medications, are among the most effective in treating BED. Interpersonal

therapy, as well as dialectical behavioral therapy, have also been effective in reducing binge-

eating episodes; however, they have not been effective in weight loss (Guerdjikova, Mori,

Casuto, & McElroy, 2017). Goals of treatment are, of course, to eliminate binge eating episodes,

as well as reduce body weight as most individuals with BED are overweight. Seeing as BED has

only recently been established as a separate eating disorder, treatment research specific to this

disorder is expected to grow.

       10.5.3.1. Antidepressant medications. Given the high comorbidity between eating

disorders and depressive symptoms, antidepressants have been a primary method of treatment for

years. While they have been shown to improve depressive symptoms, which may help

individuals make gains in their eating disorder treatment, research has not supported

antidepressants as an effective treatment strategy for treating the eating disorder itself.

10.5.4. Outcome of Treatment

         Now that we have discussed treatments for eating disorders, how effective are they?

Research has indicated favorable prognostic features for anorexia nervosa are early age of onset

and a short history of the disorder. Conversely, unfavorable features are a long history of

symptoms prior to treatment, severe weight loss, and binge eating and vomiting. The mortality

rate over the first 10 years from presentation is about 10% (APA, 2013). The majority of these

deaths are from medical complications due to the disorder or suicide.

         Unfortunately, research has not identified any consistent predictors of positive outcomes

for bulimia nervosa. However, there is some speculation that individuals with childhood obesity,

low self-esteem, and those with a personality disorder have worse treatment outcomes (APA,

2013).

         While treatment outcome for BED is still in its infancy, initial findings suggest that

remission rates of BED are much higher than that for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.

                                 11.1. Clinical Presentation



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Define substances and substance abuse.

       •   Describe properties of substance abuse.



11.1.1. Substance Abuse

       Substance-related disorders are among the most prevalent psychological disorders, with

roughly 100 million people in the United States reporting the use of an illegal substance

sometime throughout their life (SAMHSA, 2014). While this disorder was previously classified

as “drug abuse,” the classification was expanded to acknowledge the abuse of other substances

such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine.

       What are substances? Substances are any ingested materials that cause temporary

cognitive, behavioral, or physiological symptoms within the individual. The changes that are

observed directly after or within a few hours of ingestion of the substance are classified as

substance intoxication (APA, 2013). Substance intoxication symptoms vary greatly and are

dependent on the type of substance ingested. Specific substances and their effects will be

discussed later in the module.

       Repeated use of these substances or frequent substance intoxication can develop into a

long-term problem known as substance abuse. Abuse occurs when an individual consumes the

substance for an extended period or has to ingest large amounts of the substance to get the same

effect a substance provided previously. The need to continually increase the amount of ingested

substance is also known as tolerance. As tolerance builds, additional physical and psychological


                                               11-3
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


symptoms present, often causing significant disturbances in an individual’s personal and

professional life. Individuals with substance abuse are often spending a significant amount of

time engaging in activities that revolve around their substance use, thus spending less time in

recreational activities that once consumed their time. Sometimes, there is a desire to reduce or

abstain from substance use; however, cravings and withdrawal symptoms often prohibit this

from occurring on one’s own attempts. Common withdrawal symptoms include but are not

limited to cramps, anxiety attacks, sweating, nausea, tremors, and hallucinations. Depending on

the substance and the tolerance level, most withdrawal symptoms last anywhere from a few days

to a week. For those with extensive substance abuse or abuse of multiple substances, withdrawal

should be closely monitored in a hospital setting to avoid severe consequences such as seizures,

stroke, or even death.

       According to the DSM-5 (APA, 2013), an individual is diagnosed with Substance

Intoxication, Use, and/or Withdrawal specific to the substance(s) the individual is ingesting.

While there are some subtle differences in symptoms, particularly psychological, physical, and

behavioral symptoms, the general diagnostic criteria for Substance Intoxication, Use, and

Withdrawal remains the same across substances. Therefore, the general diagnostic criteria for

Substance Intoxication, Use, and Withdrawal are reviewed below, with more specific details of

psychological, physical, and/or behavioral symptoms in the Types of Substances Abused section.

       For a diagnosis of Substance Intoxication, the individual must have recently ingested a

substance (APA, 2013). Immediately following the ingestion of this substance, significant

behavioral and/or psychological change is observed. In addition, physical and physiological

symptoms present as a direct result of the substance ingested. As stated above, these behavioral,

physical, and physiological symptoms are dependent on the type of substance that is ingested



                                               11-4
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


and, therefore, discussed in more detail within each substance category (i.e., depressants,

stimulants, hallucinogens/cannabis/combination).

       To meet the criteria for Substance Use Disorder, an individual must experience

significant impairment or distress for 12 months due to their use of a substance (APA, 2013).

Distress or impairment can be described as any of the following: inability to complete or lack of

participation in work, school or home activities; increased time spent on activities obtaining,

using, or recovering from substance use; impairment in social or interpersonal relationships; use

of a substance in a potentially hazardous situation; psychological problems due to recurrent

substance abuse; craving the substance; an increase in the amount of substance used over time

(i.e., tolerance); difficulty reducing the amount of substance used despite a desire to reduce/stop

using; and/or withdrawal symptoms (APA, 2013). While the number of these symptoms may

vary among individuals, only two symptoms are required for a diagnosis of Substance Use

Disorder.

       Finally, Substance Withdrawal is diagnosed when there is cessation or reduction of a

substance that has been used for a long period of time. Individuals undergoing substance

withdrawal will experience physiological and psychological symptoms within a few hours after

cessation/reduction (APA, 2013). These symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in

daily functioning. Similar to Substance Intoxication, physiological and psychological symptoms

during substance withdrawal are often specific to the substance abused and are discussed in more

detail within each substance category later in the module.

11.1.2. Types of Substances Abused

       The most commonly abused substances can be divided into three categories based on

how they impact one’s physiological state: depressants, stimulants, and

hallucinogens/cannabis/combination.

       11.1.2.1. Depressants. Depressant substances such as alcohol, sedative-hypnotic drugs,

and opioids are known to have an inhibiting effect on one’s central nervous system; therefore,

they are often used to alleviate tension and stress. Unfortunately, when used in large amounts,

they can also impair an individual’s judgment and motor activity.

       While alcohol is one of the only legal (over-the-counter) substances we will discuss, it is

also the most commonly consumed substance. According to the 2015 National Survey on Drug

Use and Health, approximately 70% of individuals drank an alcoholic beverage in the last year,

and nearly 56% of individuals drank an alcoholic beverage in the past month (SAMHSA, 2015).

While the legal age of consumption in the United States is 21, approximately 78% of teens report

that they drank alcohol at some point in their life (SAMHSA, 2013).

       Despite the legal age of consumption, many college-aged students engage in binge or

heavy drinking. In fact, 45% of college-aged students report engaging in binge drinking, with

14% binge drinking at least 5 days per month (SAMHSA, 2013). In addition to these high levels

of alcohol consumption, students also engage in other behaviors such as skipping meals, which

can impact the rate of alcohol intoxication and place them at risk for dehydration, blacking out,

and developing alcohol-induced seizures (Piazza-Gardner & Barry, 2013).

       The “active” substance of alcohol, ethyl alcohol, is a chemical that is absorbed quickly

into the blood via the lining of the stomach and intestine. Once in the bloodstream, ethyl alcohol

travels to the central nervous system (i.e., brain and spinal cord) and produces depressive



                                               11-6
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


symptoms such as impaired reaction time, disorientation, and slurred speech. These symptoms

are produced due to the ethyl alcohol binding to GABA receptors, thus preventing GABA from

providing inhibitory messages and allowing the individual to relax (Filip et al., 2015).

       The effect of ethyl alcohol in moderation allows for an individual to relax, engage more

readily in conversation, and in general, produce a confident and happy personality. However,

when consumption is increased or excessive, the central nervous system is unable to metabolize

the ethyl alcohol adequately, and adverse effects begin to present. Symptoms such as blurred

vision, difficulty walking, slurred speech, slowed reaction time, and sometimes, aggressive

behaviors are observed.

       The extent to which these symptoms present are directly related to the concentration of

ethyl alcohol within the body, as well as the individual’s ability to metabolize the ethyl alcohol.

There are a lot of factors that contribute to how quickly one’s body can metabolize ethyl alcohol.

Food, gender, body weight, and medications are among the most common factors that affect

alcohol absorption (NIAAA,1997). More specifically, recent consumption of food, particularly

that high in fat and carbohydrates, slows the absorption rate of ethyl alcohol, thus reducing its

effects. With regard to gender, women absorb and metabolize alcohol differently than men,

likely due to the smaller amount of body water and the lower activity of an alcohol metabolizing

enzyme in the stomach. Another factor related to gender is weight—with individuals with more

body mass metabolizing the alcohol at a slower rate than those who weigh less. Finally, various

medications, both over the counter and prescription, can impact the liver’s ability to metabolize

alcohol, thus affecting the severity of symptoms that present (NIAAA, 1997).

       Sedative-Hypnotic drugs, more commonly known as anxiolytic drugs, have a calming

and relaxing effect on individuals. When used at a clinically appropriate dosage, they can have a



                                                11-7
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


sedative effect, thus making them a suitable drug for treating anxiety-related disorders. In the

early 1900s, barbiturates were introduced as the main sedative and hypnotic drug; however, due

to their addictive nature, as well as respiratory distress when consumed in large amounts, they

have been largely replaced by benzodiazepines which are considered a safer alternative as they

have less addictive qualities (Filip et al., 2014).

        Commonly prescribed benzodiazepines— Xanax, Ativan, and Valium—have a similar

effect to alcohol as they too bind to the GABA receptors and increase GABA activity (Filip et

al., 2014). This increase in GABA produces a sedative and calming effect. Benzodiazepines can

be prescribed for both temporary relief (pre-flight or before surgery) or long-term use

(generalized anxiety disorder). While they do not produce respiratory distress in large dosages

like benzodiazepines, they can cause intoxication and addictive behaviors due to their effects on

tolerance.

        Opioids are naturally occurring, derived from the sap of the opium poppy. In the early

1800s, morphine was isolated from opium by German chemist Friedrich Wilhelm Adam

Serturner. Due to its analgesic effect, it was named after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus

(Brownstein, 1993). Its popularity grew during the American Civil War as it was the primary

medication given to soldiers with battle injuries. Unfortunately, this is also when the addictive

nature of the medication was discovered, as many soldiers developed “Soldier’s Disease” as a

response to tolerance of the drug (Casey, 1978).

        In an effort to alleviate the addictive nature of morphine, heroin was synthesized by the

German chemical company Bayer in 1898 and was offered in a cough suppressant (Yes, Bayer

promoted heroin). For years, heroin remained in cough suppressants as well as other pain

reducers until it was discovered that heroin was actually more addictive than morphine. In 1917,



                                                  11-8
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


Congress identified that all drugs derived from opium were addictive, thus banning the use of

opioids in over-the-counter medications.

         Opioids are unique in that they provide both euphoria and drowsiness. Tolerance to these

drugs builds quickly, thus resulting in an increased need of the medication to produce desired

effects. This rapid tolerance is also likely responsible for opioids’ highly addictive nature. Opioid

withdrawal symptoms can range from restlessness, muscle pain, fatigue, anxiety, and insomnia.

Unfortunately, these withdrawal symptoms, as well as intense cravings for the drug, can persist

for several months, with some reports up to years. Because of the intensity and longevity of these

withdrawal symptoms, many individuals struggle to remain abstinent, and accidental overdoses

are common (CDC, 2013).

         The rise of abuse and misuse of opioid products in the early-to-mid 2000s is a direct

result of the increased number of opioid prescription medications containing oxycodone and

hydrocodone (Jayawant & Balkrishnana, 2005). The 2015 report estimated 12.5 million

Americans were abusing prescription narcotic pain relievers in the past year (SAMHSA, 2016).

In efforts to reduce the abuse of these medications, the FDA developed programs to educate

prescribers about the risks of misuse and abuse of opioid medications.

         11.1.2.2. Stimulants. The two most common types of stimulants abused are cocaine and

amphetamines. Unlike depressants that reduce the activity of the central nervous system,

stimulants have the opposite effect, increasing the activity in the central nervous system.

Physiological changes that occur with stimulants are increased blood pressure, heart rate,

pressured thinking/speaking, and rapid, often jerky behaviors. Because of these symptoms,

stimulants are commonly used for their feelings of euphoria, to reduce appetite, and prevent

sleep.



                                                11-9
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


       Similar to opioids, cocaine is extracted from a South American plant—the coca plant—

and produces feelings of energy and euphoria. It is the most potent natural stimulant known to

date (Acosta et al., 2011). As stated, low doses can produce feelings of excitement, talkativeness,

and euphoria; however, as the amount of ingested cocaine increases, physiological changes such

as rapid breathing, increased blood pressure, and excessive arousal can be observed. The

psychological and physiological effects of cocaine are due to an increase of dopamine,

norepinephrine, and serotonin in various brain structures (Haile, 2012; Hart & Ksir, 2014).

One key feature of cocaine use is the rapid high of cocaine intoxication, followed by the quick

depletion, or crashing, as the drug diminishes within the body. During the euphoric intoxication,

individuals will experience poor muscle coordination, grandiosity, compulsive behavior,

aggression, and possible hallucinations and delusions (Haile, 2012). Conversely, as the drug

leaves the system, the individual will experience adverse effects such as headaches, dizziness,

and fainting (Acosta et al., 2011). These negative feelings often produce a negative feedback

loop, encouraging individuals to ingest more cocaine to alleviate the negative symptoms. This

also increases the chance of accidental overdose.

       Cocaine is unique in that it can be ingested in various ways. While cocaine was initially

snorted via the nasal cavity, individuals found that if the drug was smoked or injected, its effects

were more potent and longer-lasting (Haile, 2012). The most common way cocaine is currently

ingested is via freebasing, which involves heating cocaine with ammonia to extract the cocaine

base. This method produces a form of cocaine that is almost 100 percent pure. Due to its low

melting point, freebased cocaine is easy to smoke via a glass pipe. Inhaled cocaine is absorbed

into the bloodstream and brain within 10-15 seconds suggesting its effects are felt almost

immediately (Addiction Centers of America).



                                               11-10
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


       Crack is a derivative of cocaine that is formed by combining cocaine with water and

another substance (commonly baking soda) to create a solid structure that is then broken into

smaller pieces. Because of this process, it requires very little cocaine to make crack, thus making

it a more affordable drug. Coined for the crackling sound that is produced when it is smoked, it is

also highly addictive, likely due to the fast-acting nature of the drug. While the effects of cocaine

peak in 20-30 minutes and last for about 1-2 hours, the effects of crack peak in 3-5 minutes and

last only for up to 60 minutes (Addiction Centers of America).

       Amphetamines are manufactured in a laboratory setting. Currently, the most common

amphetamines are prescription medications such as Ritalin, Adderall, and Dexedrine (prescribed

for sleep disorders). These medications produce an increase in energy and alertness and reduce

appetite when taken at clinical levels. However, when consumed at larger dosages, they can

produce intoxication similar to psychosis, including violent behaviors. Due to the increased

energy levels and appetite suppressant qualities, these medications are often abused by students

studying for exams, athletes needing extra energy, and individuals seeking weight loss (Haile,

2012). Biologically, similar to cocaine, amphetamines affect the central nervous system by

increasing the amount of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in the brain (Haile, 2012).

       Methamphetamine, a derivative of amphetamine, is often abused due to its low cost and

feelings of euphoria and confidence; however, it can have serious health consequences such as

heart and lung damage (Hauer, 2010). Most commonly used intravenously or nasally,

methamphetamine can also be eaten or heated to a temperature in which it can be smoked. The

most notable effects of methamphetamine use are the drastic physical changes to one’s

appearance, including significant teeth damage and facial lesions (Rusyniak, 2011).

       While I’m sure you all are well aware of how caffeine is consumed, you may be

surprised to learn that in addition to coffee, energy drinks, and soft drinks, caffeine can also be

found in chocolate and tea. Because of the vast use of caffeine, it is the most widely consumed

substance in the world, with approximately 90% of Americans consuming some form of caffeine

every day (Fulgoni, Keast, & Lieberman, 2015). While caffeine is often consumed in moderate

dosages, caffeine intoxication and withdrawal can occur. In fact, an increase in caffeine

intoxication and withdrawal have been observed with the simultaneous popularity of energy

drinks. Common energy drinks such as Monster and RedBull have nearly double the amount of

caffeine of tea and coke (Bigard, 2010). While adults commonly consume these drinks, a

startling 30% of middle and high schoolers also report regular consumption of energy drinks to

assist with academic and athletic responsibilities (Terry-McElrath, O’Malley, & Johnston, 2014).

The rapid increase in caffeinated beverages has led to a rise in ER visits due to the intoxication

effects (SAMHSA, 2013).

       11.1.2.3. Hallucinogens/Cannabis/Combination. The final category includes both

hallucinogens and cannabis- both of which produce sensory changes after ingestion. While

hallucinogens are known for their ability to produce more severe delusions and hallucinations,

cannabis also has the capability of producing delusions or hallucinations; however, this typically

occurs only when large amounts of cannabis are ingested. More commonly, cannabis has been

known to have stimulant and depressive effects, thus classifying itself in a group of its own due

to the many different effects of the substance.

       Hallucinogens come from natural sources and have been involved in cultural and

religious ceremonies for thousands of years. Synthetic forms of hallucinogens have also been

created—most common of which are PCP, Ketamine, LSD, and Ecstasy. In general,



                                                  11-12
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


hallucinogens produce powerful changes in sensory perception. Depending on the type of drug

ingested, effects can range from hallucinations, changes in color perception, or distortion of

objects. Additionally, some individuals report enhanced auditory, as well as changes in physical

perception such as tingling or numbness of limbs and interchanging hot and cold sensations

(Weaver & Schnoll, 2008). Interestingly, the effect of hallucinogens can vary both between

individuals, as well as within the same individual. This means that the same amount of the same

drug may produce a positive experience one time, but a negative experience the next time.

       Overall, hallucinogens do not have addictive qualities; however, individuals can build a

tolerance, thus needing larger quantities to produce similar effects (Wu, Ringwalt, Weiss, &

Blazer, 2009). Furthermore, there is some evidence that long-term use of these drugs results in

psychosis, mood, or anxiety disorders due to the neurobiological changes after using

hallucinogens (Weaver & Schnoll, 2008).

       Similar to hallucinogens and a few other substances, cannabis is also derived from a

natural plant—the hemp plant. While the most powerful of hemp plants is hashish, the most

commonly known type of cannabis, marijuana, is a mixture of hemp leaves, buds, and tops of

plants (SAMHSA, 2014). Many external factors impact the potency of cannabis, such as the

climate it was grown in, the method of preparation, and the duration of storage. Of the active

chemicals within cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) appears to be the single component

that determines the potent nature of the drug. Various strains of marijuana have varying amounts

of THC; hashish contains a high concentration of THC, while marijuana has a small

concentration.

       THC binds to cannabinoid receptors in the brain, which produces psychoactive effects.

These effects vary depending on both an individual’s body chemistry, as well as various strains

and concentrations of THC. Most commonly, people report feelings of calm and peace,

relaxation, increased hunger, and pain relief. Occasionally, negative symptoms such as increased

anxiety or paranoia, dizziness, and increased heart rate also occur. In rare cases, individuals

develop psychotic symptoms or schizophrenia following cannabis use (Donoghue et al., 2014).

While nearly 20 million Americans report regular use of marijuana, only ten percent of these

individuals will develop a dependence on the drug (SAMHSA, 2013). Of particular concern is

the number of adolescents engaging in cannabis use. One in eight 8th graders, one in four 10th

graders, and one in three 12th graders reported use of marijuana in the past year (American

Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 2013). Individuals who begin cannabis abuse

during adolescence are at an increased risk of developing cognitive effects from the drug due to

the critical period of brain development during adolescence (Gruber, Sagar, Dahlgren, Racine, &

Lukas, 2012). Increased discussion about the effects of marijuana use, as well as

psychoeducation about substance abuse in general, is important in preventing marijuana use

during adolescence.

       It is not uncommon for substance abusers to consume more than one type of substance at

a time. This combination of substance use can have dangerous results depending on the

interactions between substances. For example, if multiple depressant drugs (i.e., alcohol,

benzodiazepines, and/or opiates) are consumed at one time, an individual is at risk for severe

respiratory distress or even death due to the compounding depressive effects on the central

nervous system. Additionally, when an individual is under the influence of one substance,

judgement may be impaired, and ingestion of a larger amount of another drug may lead to an

accidental overdose. Finally, the use of one drug to counteract the effects of another drug—

taking a depressant to combat the effects of a stimulant—is equally as dangerous as the body is

unable to regulate homeostasis.

Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the epidemiology of depressants.

       •   Describe the epidemiology of stimulants.

       •   Describe the epidemiology of hallucinogens.



       It has been estimated that nearly 9 percent of teens and adults in the United States have a

substance abuse disorder (SAMHSA, 2014). Asian/Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, and African

Americans are less likely to develop a lifetime substance abuse disorder compared to non-

Hispanic white individuals (Grant et al., 2016). Native Americans have the highest rate of

substance abuse at nearly 22 percent (NSDUH, 2013). Additional demographic variables also

suggest that overall substance abuse is greater in men than women, younger versus older

individuals, unmarried/divorced individuals than married, and in those with an education level of

a high school degree or lower (Grant et al., 2016). With regards to specific types of substances,

the highest prevalence rates of substances abused are cannabis, opioids, and cocaine, respectively

(Grant et al., 2016).



11.2.1. Depressants

       Concerning depressant substances, men outnumber women in alcohol abuse 2 to 1

(Johnston et al., 2014). Ethnically, Native Americans have highest rate of alcoholism, followed

by White, Hispanic, African, Asian, respectively. With regards to opioid use, roughly 1 percent

of the population have this disorder, with 80% of those being addicted to pain-reliever opioids

such as oxycodone or morphine; the remaining 20% are heroin (SAMHSA, 2014).

11.2.2. Stimulants

       Nearly 1.1 percent of all high school seniors have used cocaine within the past month

(Johnston et al., 2014). Due to the high cost of cocaine, it is more commonly found in suburban

neighborhoods where consumers have the financial means to purchase the drugs.

Methamphetamine is used by men and women equally. It is popular among biker gangs, rural

America, and urban gay communities, as well as in clubs and all-night dance parties (aka raves;

Hopfer, 2011).

       A major discussion concerning stimulant substance abuse is the abuse of stimulant

medication among college students. This is a growing concern, with 17% of college students

reportedly abusing stimulant medications. Greek organization membership, academic

performance, and other substance use were the most highly correlated variables related to

stimulant medication abuse.



11.2.3. Hallucinogens

       Up to 14% of the general population have used LSD or another hallucinogen. Nearly 20

million adults and adolescents report current use of marijuana. Men report more than women.

Sixty-five percent of individuals report their first drug of use was marijuana—labeling it as a

gateway drug to other illicit substances (APA, 2013). Due to the increased research and positive

effects of medicinal marijuana, the movement to legalize recreational marijuana has gained

momentum, particularly in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.

Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the comorbidity of substance-related and addictive disorders.



       Substance abuse, in general, has a high comorbidity rate within itself (meaning abuse of

multiple different substances), as well as with other mental health disorders. Researchers believe

that substance abuse disorders are often secondary to another mental health disorder, as the

substance abuse develops as a means to “self-medicate” the underlying psychological disorder.

In fact, several large surveys identified alcohol and drug dependence to be twice as more likely

in individuals with anxiety, affective, and psychotic disorders than the general public (Hartz et

al., 2014). While it is difficult to identify exact estimates of the relationship between substance

abuse and serious mental health disorders, the consensus among researchers is that there is a

strong relationship between substance abuse and mood, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, and

personality disorders (Grant et al., 2016).

Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the biological causes of substance-related and addictive disorders.

       •   Describe the cognitive causes of substance-related and addictive disorders.

       •   Describe the behavioral causes of substance-related and addictive disorders.

       •   Describe the sociocultural causes of substance-related and addictive disorders.



11.4.1. Biological

       11.4.1.1. Genetics. Similar to other mental health disorders, substance abuse is

genetically influenced. With that said, it is different than other mental health disorders in that if

the individual is not exposed to the substance, they will not develop substance abuse.

Heritability of alcohol abuse is among the most well studied substances, likely because it is the

only legal substance (except cannabis in some states). Twin studies have indicated a range of 50-

60% heritability risk for alcohol disorder (Kendler et al., 1997). Studies exploring the heritability

of other substance abuse, particularly drug use, suggests there may be a stronger heritability link

than previously thought (Jang, Livesley, & Vernon, 1995). Twin studies indicate that the genetic

component of drug abuse is stronger than drug use in general, meaning that genetic factors are

more significant for abuse of a substance over nonproblematic use (Tsuang et al., 1996).

Merikangas and colleagues (1998) found an 8-fold increased risk for developing a substance

abuse disorder across a wide range of substances.

       Unique to substance abuse is the fact that both genetic and familial influence are both at

play. What does this mean? Well, biologically, the individual may be genetically predisposed to


                                                11-20
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


substance abuse; additionally, the individual may also be at risk due to their familial environment

where their parents or siblings are also engaging in substance abuse. Individuals whose parents

abuse substances may have a greater opportunity to ingest substances, thus promoting drug-

seeking behaviors. Furthermore, families with a history of substance abuse may have a more

accepting attitude of drug use than families with no history of substance abuse (Leventhal &

Schmitz, 2006).

       11.4.1.2. Neurobiological. A longstanding belief about how drug abuse begins and is

maintained is the brain reward system. A reward can be defined as any event that increases the

likelihood of a response and has a pleasurable effect. The majority of research on the brain

reward system has focused on the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, as it appears this area is

the primary reward system of most substances that are abused. As research has evolved in the

field of substance abuse, five additional neurotransmitters have also been implicated in the

reinforcing effect of addiction: dopamine, opioid peptides, GABA, serotonin, and

endocannabinoids. More specifically, dopamine is less involved in opioid, alcohol, and cannabis.

Alcohol and benzodiazepines lower the production of GABA, while cocaine and amphetamines

decrease dopamine. Cannabis has been shown to reduce the production of endocannabinoids.



11.4.2. Cognitive

       Cognitive theorists have focused on the beliefs regarding the anticipated effects of

substance use. Defined as the expectancy effect, drug-seeking behavior is presumably motivated

by the desire to attain a particular outcome by ingesting a substance. The expectancy effect can

be defined in both positive and negative forms. Positive expectations are thought to increase

drug-seeking behavior, while negative experiences would decrease substance use (Oei &



                                              11-21
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


Morawska, 2004). Several studies have examined the expectancy effect on the use of alcohol.

Those with alcohol abuse reported expectations of tension reduction, enhanced sexual

experiences, and improved social pleasure (Brown, 1985). Additionally, observing positive

experiences, both in person and through television or social media, also shapes our drug use

expectancies.

       While some studies have explored the impact of negative expectancy as a way to

eliminate substance abuse, research has failed to continually support this theory, suggesting that

positive experiences and expectations are a more powerful motivator of substance abuse than the

negative experiences (Jones, Corbin, Fromme, 2001).



11.4.3. Behavioral

       Operant conditioning has been implicated in the role of developing substance use

disorders. As you may remember, operant conditioning refers to the increase or decrease of a

behavior, due to reinforcement or punishment. Since we are talking about increasing substance

use, behavioral theorists suggest that substance abuse is positively and negatively reinforced due

to the effects of a substance.

       Positive reinforcement occurs when substance use is increased due to the positive or

pleasurable experiences of the substance. More specifically, the rewarding effect or pleasurable

experiences while under the influence of various substances directly impacts the likelihood that

the individual will use the substance again. Studies of substance use on animals routinely support

this theory as animals will work to receive injections of various drugs (Wise & Koob, 2013).

       Negative reinforcement, or the increase of a given behavior due to the removal of a

negative effect, also plays a role in substance abuse in two different ways. First, many people



                                              11-22
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


ingest a substance as an escape from their unpleasant life—whether it be physical pain, stress, or

anxiety, to name a few. Therefore, the substance temporarily provides relief from a negative

environment, thus reinforcing future substance abuse (Wise & Koob, 2013). Secondly, negative

reinforcement is involved in symptoms of withdrawal. As previously mentioned, withdrawal

from a substance often produces significant negative symptoms such as nausea, vomiting,

uncontrollable shaking, etc. To eliminate these symptoms, an individual will consume more of

the substance, thus again escaping the negative symptoms and enjoying the “highs” of the

substance.



11.4.4. Sociocultural

       Arguably, one of the strongest influences of substance abuse is the impact of one’s

friends and the immediate environment. Peer attitudes, perception of others’ drug use, pressure

from peers to use substances, and beliefs about substance use are among the strongest predictors

of drug use patterns (Leventhal & Schmitz, 2006). This is particularly concerning during

adolescence when patterns of substance use typically begin.

       Additionally, research continually supports a strong relationship between second-

generation substance abusers (Wilens et al., 2014). The increased possibility of family members’

substance abuse is likely related to both a genetic predisposition, as well as the accepting attitude

of the familial environment (Chung et al., 2014). Not only does a child have early exposure to

these substances if their parent has a substance abuse problem, but they are also less likely to

have parental supervision, which may impact their decision related to substance use (Wagner et

al., 2010). One potential protective factor against substance use is religiosity. More specifically,




                                               11-23
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


families that promote religiosity may actually reduce substance use by promoting negative

experiences (Galen & Rogers, 2004).

       Another sociocultural view on substance abuse is stressful life events, particularly those

related to financial stability. Prevalence rates of substance abuse are higher among poorer people

(SAMHSA, 2014). Furthermore, additional stressors such as childhood abuse and trauma,

negative work environments, as well as discrimination are also believed to contribute to the

development of a substance use disorder (Hurd, Varner, Caldwell, & Zimmerman, 2014;

McCabe, Wilsnack, West, & Boyd, 2010; Unger et al., 2014).



  You should have learned the following in this section:
      •   Biological causes of substance-related and addictive disorders include a genetic
          predisposition though if the individual is not exposed to the substance they will
          not develop the substance abuse and the brain reward system.
      •   Cognitive causes of substance-related and addictive disorders include the
          expectancy effect, though research provides stronger support for positive
          expectancy over negative expectancy.
      •   Behavioral causes of substance-related and addictive disorders include positive
          and negative reinforcement.

           disorders.

       •   Describe sociocultural treatment options for substance-related and addictive

           disorders.



       Given the large number of the population affected by substance abuse, it is not surprising

that there are many different approaches to treat substance use disorder. Overall, treatments for

substance-related disorders are only mildly effective, likely due in large part to the addictive

qualities in many of these substances (Belendiuk & Riggs, 2014).



11.5.1. Biological

       11.5.1.1. Detoxification. Detoxification refers to the medical supervision of withdrawal

from a specified drug. While most detoxification programs are inpatient for increased

monitoring, some programs allow for outpatient detoxification, particularly if the addiction is not

as severe. There are two main theories of detoxification—gradually decreasing the amount of the

substance until the individual is off the drug completely, or, eliminate the substance entirely

while providing additional medications to manage withdrawal symptoms (Bisaga et al., 2015).




                                               11-25
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


Unfortunately, relapse rates are high for those engaging in detoxification programs, particularly

if they lack any follow-up psychological treatment.

         11.5.1.2. Agonist drugs. As researchers continue to learn more about both the

mechanisms of substances commonly abused, as well as the mechanisms in which the body

processes these substances, alternative medications are created to essentially replace the drug in

which the individual is dependent on. These agonist drugs provide the individual with a “safe”

drug that has a similar chemical make-up to the addicted drug. One common example of this is

methadone, an opiate agonist that is often used in the reduction of heroin use (Schwartz,

Brooner, Montoya, Currens, & Hayes, 2010). Unfortunately, because methadone reacts to the

same neurotransmitter receptors as heroin, the individual essentially replaces their addiction to

heroin with an addiction to methadone. While this is not ideal, methadone treatment is highly

regulated under safe medical supervision. Furthermore, it is taken by mouth, thus eliminating the

potential adverse effects of unsterilized needles in heroin use. While some argue that methadone

maintenance programs are not an effective treatment because it simply replaces one drug for

another, others claim that the combination of methadone with education and psychotherapy can

successfully help individuals off both illicit drugs and methadone medications (Jhanjee, 2014).

         11.5.1.3. Antagonist drugs. Unlike agonist drugs, antagonist drugs block or change the

effects of the addictive drug. The most commonly prescribed antagonist drugs are Disulfiram and

Naloxone. Disulfiram is often given to individuals trying to abstain from alcohol as it produces

significant negative effects (i.e., nausea, vomiting, increased heart rate, and dizziness) when

coupled with alcohol consumption. While this can be an effective treatment to eliminate alcohol

use, the individual must be motivated to take the medication as prescribed (Diclemente et al.,

2008).



                                               11-26
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


       Similar to Disulfiram, Naloxone is used for individuals with opioid abuse. Naloxone acts

by binding to endorphin receptors, thus preventing the opioids from having the intended euphoric

effect. In theory, this treatment appears promising, but it is extremely dangerous as it can send

the individual into immediate, severe withdrawal symptoms (Alter, 2014). This type of treatment

requires appropriate medical supervision to ensure the safety of the patient.



11.5.2. Behavioral

       11.5.2.1. Aversion therapy. Based on classical conditioning principles, aversion

therapy is a form of treatment for substance abuse that pairs the stimulus with some type of

negative or aversive stimulus. For example, an individual may be given a shock every time they

think about or attempt to drink alcohol. By pairing this aversive stimulus to the abused

substance, the individual will begin to independently pair the substance with an aversive thought,

thus reducing their craving/desire for the substance. Some view the use of agonist and antagonist

drugs as a form of aversion therapy as these medications utilize the same treatment strategy as

traditional aversion therapy.

       11.5.2.2. Contingency management. Contingency management is a treatment approach

that emphasizes operant conditioning—increasing sobriety and adherence to treatment programs

through rewards. Originally developed to increase adherence to medication and reinforce opiate

abstinence in methadone patients, contingency management has been adapted to increase

abstinence in many different substance abuse treatment programs. In general, patients are

“rewarded” with vouchers or prizes in exchange for abstinence from substance use (Hartzler,

Lash, & Roll, 2012). These vouchers allow individuals to gain incentives specific to their

interests, thus increasing the chances of abstinence. Common vouchers include movie tickets,

sports equipment, or even cash (Mignon, 2014).

       Contingency management has been proven to be effective in treating various types of

substance abuse, particularly alcohol and cocaine (Lewis & Petry, 2005). Not only has it been

effective in reducing substance use in addicts, but it has also been effective in increasing the

amount of time patients remain in treatment as well as compliance with the treatment program

(Mignon, 2014). Despite its success, dissemination of this type of treatment has been rare. In an

effort to rectify this, the federal government has provided financial resources through SAMHSA

for the development, implementation, and evaluation of contingency management as a treatment

to reduce alcohol and drug use (Mignon, 2014).



11.5.3. Cognitive-Behavioral

       11.5.3.1. Relapse prevention training. Relapse prevention training is essentially what it

sounds like—identifying potentially high-risk situations for relapse and then learning behavioral

skills and cognitive interventions to prevent the occurrence of a relapse. Early in treatment, the

clinician guides the patient to identify any interpersonal, intrapersonal, environmental, and

physiological risks for relapse. Once these triggers are identified, the clinician works with the

patient on cognitive and behavioral strategies such as learning effective coping strategies,

enhancing self-efficacy, and encouraging mastery of outcomes. Additionally, psychoeducation

about how substance abuse is maintained, as well as identifying maladaptive thoughts and

learning cognitive restructuring techniques, helps the patient make informed choices during high-

risk situations. Finally, role-playing these high-risk situations in session allows patients to

become comfortable engaging in these effective coping strategies that enhance their self-efficacy



                                                11-28
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


and ultimately reducing the chances of a relapse. Research for relapse prevention training

appears to be somewhat effective for individuals with substance-related disorders (Marlatt &

Donovan, 2005).



11.5.4. Sociocultural

       11.5.4.1. Self-help. In 1935, two men suffering from alcohol abuse met and discussed

their treatment options. Slowly, the group grew, and by 1946, this group was known as

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). The two founders, along with other early members, developed the

Twelve Step Traditions as a way to help guide members in spiritual and character development.

Due to the popularity of the treatment program, other programs such as Narcotics Anonymous

and Cocaine Anonymous adopted and adapted the Twelve Steps for their respective substance

abuse. Similarly, Al-Anon and Alateen are two support groups that offer support for families and

teenagers of individuals struggling with alcohol abuse.

       The overarching goal of AA is abstinence from alcohol. In order to achieve this, the

participants are encouraged to “take one day at a time.” In using the 12 steps, participants are

emboldened to admit that they have a disease, that they are powerless over this disease, and that

their disease is more powerful than any person. Therefore, participants turn their addiction over

to God and ask Him to help right their wrongs and remove their negative character defects and

shortcomings. The final steps include identifying and making amends to those who they have

wronged during their alcohol abuse.

       While studies examining the effectiveness of AA programs are inconclusive, AA’s

membership indicates that 27% of its members have been sober less than one year, 24% have

been sober 1-5 years, 13% have been sober 5-10 years, 14% have been sober 10-20 years, and



                                               11-29
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


more than 22% have been sober over 20 years (Alcoholics Anonymous, 2014). Some argue that

this type of treatment is most effective for those who are willing and able to abstain from alcohol

as opposed to those who can control their drinking to moderate levels.

       11.5.4.2. Residential treatment centers. Another type of treatment similar to self-help is

residential treatment programs. In this placement, individuals are completely removed from

their environment and live, work, and socialize within a drug-free community while also

attending regular individual, group, and family therapy. The types of treatment used within a

residential program varies from program to program, with most focusing on cognitive-behavioral

and behavioral techniques. Several also incorporate 12-step programs into treatment, as many

patients transition from a residential treatment center to a 12-step program post discharge. As

one would expect, the residential treatment goal is abstinence, and any evidence of substance

abuse during the program is grounds for immediate termination.

       Studies examining the effectiveness of residential treatment centers suggest that these

programs are useful in treating a variety of substance abuse disorders; however, many of these

programs are very costly, thus limiting the availability of this treatment to the general public

(Bender, 2004; Galanter, 2014). Additionally, many individuals are not able to completely

remove themselves from their daily responsibilities for several weeks to months, particularly

those with families. Therefore, while this treatment option is very effective, it is also not an

option for most individuals struggling with substance abuse.

       11.5.4.3. Community reinforcement. The goal for community reinforcement treatment

is for patients to abstain from substance use by replacing the positive reinforcements of the

substance with that of sobriety. This is done through several different techniques such as

motivational interviewing, learning adaptive coping strategies, and encouraging family support



                                                11-30
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


(Mignon, 2014). Essentially, the community around the patient reinforces the positive choices of

abstaining from substance use.

       Community reinforcement has been found to be effective in both an inpatient and

outpatient setting (Meyers & Squires, 2001). It is believed that the intrinsic motivation and the

effective coping skills, in combination with the support of an individual’s immediate community

(friends and family) is responsible for the long-term positive treatment effects of community

reinforcement.

12.1.1. The Clinical Presentation of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders

       For the purpose of this book, the schizophrenia spectrum disorder module will cover,

Schizophrenia, Schizophreniform disorder, Schizoaffective disorder, and Delusional disorder.

These schizophrenia spectrum disorders are defined by one of the following main symptoms:

delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking (speech), disorganized or abnormal motor

behavior, and negative symptoms. Individuals diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder

experience psychosis, which is defined as a loss of contact with reality. Psychosis episodes make

it difficult for individuals to perceive and respond to environmental stimuli, causing a significant

disturbance in everyday functioning. While there are a vast number of symptoms displayed in

schizophrenia spectrum disorders, presentation of symptoms varies greatly among individuals, as

there are rarely two cases similar in presentation, triggers, course, or responsiveness to treatment

(APA, 2013).



                                                12-3
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


       12.1.1.1. Delusions. Delusions are “fixed beliefs that are not amenable to change in light

of conflicting evidence” (APA, 2013, pp. 87). This means that despite evidence contradicting

one’s thoughts, the individual is unable to distinguish their thoughts from reality. The inability to

identify thoughts as delusional is likely likely due to a lack of insight. There are a wide range of

delusions that are seen in the schizophrenia related disorders to include:

       •   Delusions of grandeur- belief they have exceptional abilities, wealth, or fame; belief

           they are God or other religious saviors

       •   Delusions of control- belief that others control their thoughts/feelings/actions

       •   Delusions of thought broadcasting- belief that one’s thoughts are transparent and

           everyone knows what they are thinking

       •   Delusions of persecution- belief they are going to be harmed, harassed, plotted or

           discriminated against by either an individual or an institution; it is the most common

           delusion (Arango & Carpenter, 2010)

       •   Delusions of reference- belief that specific gestures, comments, or even larger

           environmental cues are directed directly to them

       •   Delusions of thought withdrawal- belief that one’s thoughts have been removed by

           another source

       It is believed that the presentation of the delusion is primarily related to the social,

emotional, educational, and cultural background of the individual (Arango & Carpenter, 2010).

For example, an individual with schizophrenia who comes from a highly religious family is more

likely to experience religious delusions (delusions of grandeur) than another type of delusion.

       12.1.1.2. Hallucinations. Hallucinations can occur in any of the five senses: hearing

(auditory hallucinations), seeing (visual hallucinations), smelling (olfactory hallucinations),

                                                12-4
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


touching (tactile hallucinations), and tasting (gustatory hallucinations). Additionally, they can

occur in a single modality or present across a combination of modalities (e.g., having auditory

and visual hallucinations). For the most part, individuals recognize that their hallucinations are

not real and attempt to engage in normal behavior while simultaneously combating ongoing

hallucinations.

          According to various research studies, nearly half of all patients with schizophrenia

report auditory hallucinations, 15% report visual hallucinations, and 5% report tactile

hallucinations (DeLeon, Cuesta, & Peralta, 1993). Among the most common types of auditory

hallucinations are voices talking to the patient or various voices talking to one another.

Generally, these hallucinations are not attributable to any one person that the individual knows.

They are usually clear, objective, and definite (Arango & Carpenter, 2010). Additionally, the

auditory hallucinations can be pleasurable, providing comport to the patient; however, in other

individuals, the auditory hallucinations can be unsettling as they produce commands or malicious

intent.

          12.1.1.3. Disorganized thinking. Among the most common cognitive impairments

displayed in patients with schizophrenia are disorganized thought, communication, and speech.

More specifically, thoughts and speech patterns may appear to be circumstantial or tangential.

For example, patients may give unnecessary details in response to a question before they finally

produce the desired response. While the question is eventually answered in circumstantial speech

patterns, in tangential speech patterns the patient never reaches the point. Another common

cognitive symptom is speech retardation, where the individual may take a long time before

answering a question. Derailment, or the illogical connection in a chain of thoughts, is another



                                                 12-5
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


common type of disorganized thinking. Although not always, derailment is often seen in

illogicality, or the tendency to provide bizarre explanations for things.

       These types of distorted thought patterns are often related to concrete thinking. That is,

the individual is focused on one aspect of a concept or thing and neglects all other aspects. This

type of thinking makes treatment difficult as individuals lack insight into their illness and

symptoms (APA, 2013).

       12.1.1.4. Disorganized/Abnormal motor behavior. Psychomotor symptoms can also be

observed in individuals with schizophrenia. These behaviors may manifest as awkward

movements or even ritualistic/repetitive behaviors. They are often unpredictable and

overwhelming, severely impacting their ability to perform daily activities (APA, 2013).

       12.1.1.5. Catatonic behavior. Catatonic behavior, the decreased or complete lack of

reactivity to the environment, is among the most commonly seen disorganized motor behavior in

schizophrenia. There runs a range of catatonic behaviors from negativism (resistance to

instruction); mutism or stupor (complete lack of verbal and motor responses); rigidity

(maintaining a rigid or upright posture while resisting efforts to be moved); or posturing (holding

odd, awkward postures for long periods; APA, 2013). There is one type of catatonic behavior,

catatonic excitement, where the individual experiences hyperactivity of motor behavior, in a

seemingly excited or delirious way.

       12.1.1.6. Negative symptoms. Up until this point, all the schizophrenia symptoms can be

categorized as positive symptoms, or symptoms that are an over-exaggeration of normal brain

processes; these symptoms are also new to the individual. The final diagnostic criterion of

schizophrenia is negative symptoms, which are defined as the inability or decreased ability to

initiate actions, speech, express emotion, or feel pleasure (Barch, 2013). Negative symptoms

                                                12-6
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


often present before positive symptoms and remain once positive symptoms remit. Because of

their prevalence through the course of the disorder, they are also more indicative of prognosis,

with more negative symptoms suggesting a poorer prognosis. The poorer prognosis may be

explained by the lack of effectiveness antipsychotic medications have in addressing negative

symptoms (Kirkpatrick, Fenton, Carpenter, & Marder, 2006). There are six main types of

negative symptoms seen in patients with schizophrenia. Such symptoms include:

       •   Affective flattening - Reduction in emotional expression; reduced display of

           emotional expression

       •   Alogia - Poverty of speech or speech content

       •   Anhedonia - Inability to experience pleasure

       •   Apathy - General lack of interest

       •   Asociality - Lack of interest in social relationships

       •   Avolition - Lack of motivation for goal-directed behavior



12.1.2. Schizophrenia

       As stated above, the hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia include the presentation of at

least two of the following for at least one month: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech,

disorganized/abnormal behavior, or negative symptoms. These symptoms create significant

impairment in an individual’s ability to engage in normal daily functioning such as work, school,

relationships with others, or self-care. It should be noted that the presentation of schizophrenia

varies significantly among individuals, as it is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome (APA, 2013).

       While the presence of symptoms must persist for a minimum of 6 months to meet the

criteria for a schizophrenia diagnosis, it is not uncommon to have prodromal symptoms that

                                                12-7
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


precede the active phase of the disorder and residual symptoms that follow it. These prodromal

and residual symptoms are “subthreshold” forms of psychotic symptoms that do not cause

significant impairment in functioning, with the exception of negative symptoms (Lieberman et

al., 2001). Due to the severity of psychotic symptoms, mood disorder symptoms are also

common among individuals with schizophrenia; however, these mood symptoms are distinct

from a mood disorder diagnosis in that psychotic features will exist beyond the remission of

depressive symptoms.



12.1.3. Schizophreniform Disorder

       Schizophreniform disorder is similar to schizophrenia, except for the length of

presentation of symptoms. Schizophreniform disorder is considered an “intermediate” disorder

between schizophrenia and brief psychotic disorder as the symptoms are present for at least one

month but not longer than six months. As you may recall, schizophrenia symptoms must be

present for at least six months; A brief psychotic disorder is diagnosed when symptoms are

present for less than one month. Approximately two-thirds of individuals who are initially

diagnosed with schizophreniform disorder will have symptoms that last longer than six months,

at which time their diagnosis is changed to schizophrenia (APA, 2013).

       Another key distinguishing feature of schizophreniform disorder is the lack of criteria

related to impaired functioning. While many individuals with schizophreniform disorder do

display impaired functioning, it is not essential for diagnosis. Finally, any major mood

episodes—either depressive or manic— that are present concurrently with the psychotic features

must only be present for a short time, otherwise a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder may be

more appropriate (APA, 2013).

                                               12-8
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020




12.1.4. Schizoaffective Disorder

        Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by the psychotic symptoms included in

schizophrenia and a concurrent uninterrupted period of a major mood episode—either a

depressive or manic episode. It should be noted that because the loss of interest in pleasurable

activities is a common symptom of schizophrenia, to meet the criteria for a depressive episode

within schizoaffective disorder, the individual must present with a pervasive depressed mood

(APA, 2013). While schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder do not have a significant

mood component, schizoaffective disorder requires the presence of a depressive or manic

episode for the majority, if not the total duration of the disorder. While psychotic symptoms are

sometimes present in depressive episodes, they often remit once the depressive episode is

resolved. For individuals with schizoaffective disorder, psychotic symptoms should continue for

at least two weeks in the absence of a major mood disorder (APA, 2013). This is the key

distinguishing feature between schizoaffective disorder and major depressive disorder with

psychotic features.



12.1.5. Delusional Disorder

        As suggestive of its title, delusional disorder requires the presence of at least one delusion

that lasts for at least one month in duration. It is important to note that if an individual

experiences hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior, or negative

symptoms—in addition to delusions—they should not be diagnosed with delusional disorder as

their symptoms are more aligned with a schizophrenia diagnosis. Unlike most other

schizophrenia-related disorders, daily functioning is not overly impacted due to the delusions.

                                                 12-9
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


Additionally, if symptoms of depressive or manic episodes present during delusions, they are

typically brief compared to the duration of the delusions.

       The DSM-V (APA, 2013) has identified five main subtypes of delusional disorder to

better categorize the symptoms of the individual's disorder. When making a diagnosis of

delusional disorder, one of the following modifiers (in addition to mixed presentation) is

included. Erotomanic delusion occurs when an individual reports a delusion of another person

being in love with them. Generally speaking, the individual whom the convictions are about is of

higher status, such as a celebrity. Grandiose delusion involves the conviction of having great

talent or insight. Occasionally, patients will report they have made an important discovery that

benefits the general public. Grandiose delusions may also take on religious affiliation, as people

believe they are prophets or even God. Jealous delusion revolves around the conviction that

one’s spouse or partner is/has been unfaithful. While many individuals may have this suspicion

at some point in their relationship, a jealous delusion is much more extensive and generally

based on incorrect inferences that lack evidence. Persecutory delusion involves the individual

believing that they are being conspired against, spied on, followed, poisoned or drugged,

maliciously maligned, harassed, or obstructed in pursuit of their long-term goals (APA, 2013).

Of all subtypes of delusional disorder, those experiencing persecutory delusions are the most at

risk of becoming aggressive or hostile, likely due to the persecutory nature of their distorted

beliefs. Finally, somatic delusion involves delusions regarding bodily functions or sensations.

While these delusions can vary significantly, the most common beliefs are that the individual

emits a foul odor despite attempts to rectify the smell; there is an infestation of insects on the

skin; or that they have an internal parasite (APA, 2013).

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   Schizophrenia spectrum disorders are characterized by delusions,
       hallucinations, disorganized thinking (speech), disorganized or abnormal
       motor behavior, and negative symptoms.
   •   Delusions are beliefs that do not change even when conflicting evidence is
       presented and can be of grandeur, control, thought broadcasting,
       persecution, reference, and thought withdrawal.

   •   Schizophreniform disorder is considered an “intermediate” disorder
       between schizophrenia and brief psychotic disorder as the symptoms are
       present for at least one month but not longer than six months.
   •    Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by the psychotic symptoms
       included in schizophrenia and a concurrent uninterrupted period of a major
       mood episode—either a depressive or manic episode.
   •   Delusional disorder requires the presence of at least one delusion that lasts
       for at least one month in duration to include erotomanic, grandiose,

                                       12.2. Epidemiology



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the epidemiology of schizophrenia spectrum disorders.



       Schizophrenia occurs in approximately 0.3%-0.7% of the general population (APA,

2013). There is some discrepancy in rates of diagnosis between genders; these differences appear

to be related to the emphasis of various symptoms. For example, men typically present with

more negative symptoms, whereas women present with more mood-related symptoms. Despite

gender differences in the presentation of symptoms, there appears to be an equal risk for both

genders to develop the disorder.

       Schizophrenia typically occurs between late teens and mid-30s, with the onset of the

disorder slightly earlier for males than females (APA, 2013). Earlier onset of the disorder is

generally predictive of a worse overall prognosis. Onset of symptoms is typically gradual, with

initial symptoms presenting similarly to depressive disorders; however, some individuals will

present with an abrupt presentation of the disorder. Negative symptoms appear to be more

predictive of prognosis than other symptoms. This may be due to negative symptoms being the

most persistent, and therefore, most difficult to treat. Overall, an estimated 20% of individuals

diagnosed with schizophrenia report complete recovery of symptoms (APA, 2013).

       Schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, and delusional disorder prevalence

rates are all significantly less than that of schizophrenia, occurring in less than 0.3% of the

general population. While schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed more in females than males

(similar to schizophrenia), schizophreniform and delusional disorder appear to be diagnosed
                                                12-12

equally between genders. The gender discrepancy in schizoaffective disorder is likely due to the

higher rate of depressive symptoms seen in females than males (APA, 2013).




    You should have learned the following in this section:
        •   Less than 1% of the general population is diagnosed with schizophrenia and
            20% of these people fully recovery from the disorder.
        •   Both genders have an equal risk of developing schizophrenia while men
            typically display more negative symptoms while women present with more
            mood-related symptoms.
        •   Schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, and delusional disorder
            have prevalence rates less than 0.3%.

                                       12.3. Comorbidity



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the comorbidity of schizophrenia spectrum disorders.



   There is a high comorbidity rate between schizophrenia-related disorders and substance

abuse disorders. Furthermore, there is some evidence to suggest that the use of various

substances (particularly marijuana) may place an individual at an increased risk of developing

schizophrenia if the genetic predisposition is also present (see diathesis-stress model below;

Corcoran et al., 2003). Additionally, there appears to be an increase in anxiety-related

disorders—specifically obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder—among individuals

with schizophrenia than compared to the general public.

       It should also be noted that individuals diagnosed with a schizophrenia-related disorder

are also at an increased risk for associated medical conditions such as weight gain, diabetes,

metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular and pulmonary disease (APA, 2013). This

predisposition to various medical conditions is likely related to medications and poor lifestyle

choices, and also place individuals at risk for a reduced life expectancy.

                                         12.4. Etiology



Section Learning Objectives

   •    Describe the biological causes of schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

   •    Describe the psychological causes of schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

   •    Describe the sociocultural causes of schizophrenia spectrum disorders.



12.4.1. Biological

        12.4.1.1. Genetic/Family studies. Twin and family studies consistently support the

biological theory. More specifically, if one identical twin develops schizophrenia, there is a 48%

chance that the other will also develop the disorder within their lifetime (Coon & Mitter, 2007).

This percentage drops to 17% in fraternal twins. Similarly, family studies have also found

similarities in brain abnormalities among individuals with schizophrenia and their relatives; the

more similarities, the higher the likelihood that the family member also developed schizophrenia

(Scognamiglio & Houenou, 2014).
                                              12-15
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


        12.4.1.2. Neurobiological. There is consistent and reliable evidence of a neurobiological

component in the transmission of schizophrenia. More specifically, neuroimaging studies have

found a significant reduction in overall and specific brain region volumes, as well as tissue

density of individuals with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls (Brugger, & Howes,

2017). Additionally, there has been evidence of ventricle enlargement as well as volume

reductions in the medial temporal lobe. As you may recall, structures such as the amygdala

(involved in emotion regulation), the hippocampus (involved in memory), as well as the

neocortical surface of the temporal lobes (processing of auditory information) are all structures

within the medial temporal lobe (Kurtz, 2015). Additional studies also indicate a reduction in the

orbitofrontal regions of the brain, a part of the frontal lobe that is responsible for response

inhibition (Kurtz, 2015).

        12.4.1.3. Stress cascade. The stress-vulnerability model suggests that individuals have a

genetic or biological predisposition to develop the disorder; however, symptoms will not present

unless there is a stressful precipitating factor that elicits the onset of the disorder. Researchers

have identified the HPA axis and its consequential neurological effects as the likely responsible

neurobiological component responsible for this stress cascade.

        The HPA axis is one of the main neurobiological structures that mediate stress. It

involves the regulation of three chemical messengers (corticotropin-releasing hormone [CRH],

adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH], and glucocorticoids) as they respond to a stressful

situation (Corcoran et al., 2003). Glucocorticoids, more commonly referred to as cortisol, is the

final neurotransmitter released which is responsible for the physiological change that

accompanies stress to prepare the body to “fight” or “flight.”



                                                12-16
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


       It is hypothesized that in combination with abnormal brain structures, persistently

increased levels of glucocorticoids in brain structures may be the key to the onset of psychosis in

prodromal patients (Corcoran et al., 2003). More specifically, stress exposure (and increased

glucocorticoids) affects the neurotransmitter system and exacerbates psychotic symptoms due to

changes in dopamine activity (Walker & Diforio, 1997). While research continues to explore the

relationship between stress and onset of the disorder, evidence for the implication of stress and

symptom relapse is strong. More specifically, schizophrenia patients experience more stressful

life events leading up to a relapse of symptoms. Similarly, it is hypothesized that the worsening

or exacerbation of symptoms is also a source of stress as they interfere with daily functioning

(Walker & Diforio, 1997). This stress alone may be enough to initiate the onset of a relapse.



12.4.2. Psychological

       12.4.2.1. Cognitive. The cognitive model utilizes some of the aspects of the diathesis-

stress model in that it proposes that premorbid neurocognitive impairment places individuals at

risk for aversive work/academic/interpersonal experiences. These experiences, in turn, lead to

dysfunctional beliefs and cognitive appraisals, ultimately leading to maladaptive behaviors such

as delusions/hallucinations (Beck & Rector, 2005).

       Beck proposed the following diathesis-stress model of development of schizophrenia:




                                              12-17
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020




                           Adapted from Beck & Rector, 2005, pg. 580



       Based on this theory, an underlying neurocognitive impairment (as discussed above)

makes an individual more vulnerable to experience aversive life events such as homelessness,

conflict within the family, etc. Individuals with schizophrenia are more likely to evaluate these

aversive life events with a dysfunctional attitude and maladaptive cognitive distortions. The

combination of the aversive events and negative interpretations produces a stress response in the

individual, thus igniting hyperactivation of the HPA axis. According to Beck and Rector (2005),

it is the culmination of these events leads to the development of schizophrenia.



12.4.3. Sociocultural

       12.4.3.1. Expressed emotion. Research regarding supportive family environments

suggests that families high in expressed emotion, meaning families that have high hostile,

critical, or overinvolved family members, are predictors of relapse (Bebbington & Kuipers,


                                              12-18
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


2011). In fact, individuals who return post-hospitalization to families with high criticism and

emotional involvement are twice as likely to relapse compared to those who return to families

with low expressed emotion (Corcoran et al., 2003). Several meta-analyses have concluded that

family atmosphere is causally related to relapse in patients with schizophrenia, and that these

outcomes can be improved when the family environment is improved (Bebbington & Kuipers,

2011). Therefore, one major treatment goal in families of patients with schizophrenia is to reduce

expressed emotion within family interactions.

       12.4.3.2. Family dysfunction. Even for families with low levels of expressed emotion,

there is often an increase in family stress due to the secondary effects of schizophrenia. Having a

family member with schizophrenia increases the likelihood of a disruptive family environment

due to managing the patient’s symptoms and ensuring their safety while they are home (Friedrich

et al., 2015). Because of the severity of symptoms, families with a loved one diagnosed with

schizophrenia often report more conflict in the home as well as more difficulty communicating

with one another (Kurtz, 2015).

Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe psychopharmacological treatment options for schizophrenia spectrum

           disorders.

       •   Describe psychological treatment options for schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

       •   Describe family interventions for schizophrenia spectrum disorders.



       While a combination of psychopharmacological, psychological, and family interventions

is the most effective treatment in managing schizophrenia symptoms, rarely do these treatments

restore a patient to premorbid levels of functioning (Kurtz, 2015; Penn et al., 2004). Although

more recent advancements in treatment for schizophrenia appear promising, the disease itself is

still viewed as one that requires lifelong treatment and care.



12.5.1. Psychopharmacological

       Among the first antipsychotic medications used for the treatment of schizophrenia was

Thorazine. Developed as a derivative of antihistamines, Thorazine was the first line of treatment

that produced a calming effect on even the most severely agitated patients and allowed for the

organization of thoughts. Despite their effectiveness in managing psychotic symptoms,

conventional antipsychotics (such as Thorazine and Chlorpromazine) also produced significant

side effects similar to that of neurological disorders. Therefore, psychotic symptoms were

replaced with muscle tremors, involuntary movements, and muscle rigidity. Additionally, these

conventional antipsychotics also produced tardive dyskinesia in patients, which included
                                               12-21
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


involuntary movements isolated to the tongue, mouth, and face (Tenback et al., 2006). While

only 10% of patients reported the development of tardive dyskinesia, this percentage increased

the longer patients were on the medication, as well as the higher the dose (Achalia, Chaturvedi,

Desai, Rao, & Prakash, 2014). In efforts to avoid these symptoms, clinicians have been

cognizant of not exceeding the clinically effective dose of conventional antipsychotic

medications. If the management of psychotic symptoms cannot be resolved at this level,

alternative medications are often added to produce a synergistic effect (Roh et al., 2014).

       Due to the harsh side effects of conventional antipsychotic drugs, newer, arguably more

effective second-generation or atypical antipsychotic drugs have been developed. The atypical

antipsychotic drugs appear to act on both dopamine and serotonin receptors, as opposed to only

dopamine receptors in the conventional antipsychotics. Because of this, common medications

such as clozapine (Clozaril), risperidone (Risperdal), and aripiprazole (Abilify), appear to be

more effective in managing both positive and negative symptoms. While there continues to be a

risk of developing side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, recent studies suggest it is much lower

than that of the conventional antipsychotics (Leucht, Heres, Kissling, & Davis, 2011). Thus, due

to their effectiveness and minimal side effects, atypical antipsychotic medications are typically

the first line of treatment for schizophrenia (Barnes & Marder, 2011).

       It should be noted that because of the harsh side effects of antipsychotic medications in

general, many individuals, nearly one half to three-quarters of patients, discontinue the use of

antipsychotic drugs (Leucht, Heres, Kissling, & Davis, 2011). Because of this, it is also

important to incorporate psychological treatment along with psychopharmacological treatment to

both address medication adherence, as well as provide additional support for symptom

management.

12.5.2. Psychological Interventions

     12.5.2.1. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). As discussed in previous chapters, the

goal of treatment is to identify the negative biases and attributions that influence an individual’s

interpretations of events and the subsequent consequences of these thoughts and behaviors. For

schizophrenia, CBT focuses on the maladaptive emotional and behavioral responses to psychotic

experiences, which is directly related to distress and disability. Therefore, the goal of CBT is not

on symptom reduction, but rather to improve the interpretations and understandings of these

symptoms (and experiences) which will reduce associated distress (Kurtz, 2015). Common

features of CBT for schizophrenia patients include psychoeducation about their disease and the

course of their symptoms (i.e., ways to identify coming and going of delusions/hallucinations),

challenging and replacing the negative thoughts/behaviors associated with their

delusions/hallucinations to more positive thoughts/behaviors, and finally, learning positive

coping strategies to deal with their unpleasant symptoms (Veiga-Martinez, Perez-Alvarez, &

Garcia-Montes, 2008).

       Findings from studies exploring CBT as a supportive treatment have been promising.

One study conducted by Aaron Beck (the founder of CBT) and colleagues (Grant, Huh,

Perivoliotis, Stolar, & Beck, 2011) found that recovery-oriented CBT produced a marked

improvement in overall functioning as well as symptom reduction in patients diagnosed with

schizophrenia. This study suggests that by focusing on targeted goals such as independent living,

securing employment, and improving social relationships, patients were able to slowly move

closer to these targeted goals. By also including a variety of CBT strategies such as role-playing,

scheduling community outings, and addressing negative cognitions, individuals were also able to

address cognitive and social skill deficits.

                                               12-23
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020




12.5.3. Family Interventions

       The diathesis-stress model of schizophrenia has primarily influenced family

interventions. As previously discussed, the emergence of the disorder and exacerbation of

symptoms is likely related to environmental stressors and psychological factors. While the

degree in which environmental stress stimulates an exacerbation of symptoms varies among

individuals, there is significant evidence to conclude that stress does impact illness presentation

(Haddock & Spaulding, 2011). Therefore, the overall goal of family interventions is to reduce

the stress on the individual that is likely to elicit the onset of symptoms.

       Unlike many other psychological interventions, there is not a specific outline for family-

based interventions related to schizophrenia. However, the majority of programs include the

following components: psychoeducation, problem-solving skills, and cognitive-behavioral

therapy.

       Psychoeducation is important for both the patient and family members as it is reported

that more than half of those recovering from a psychotic episode reside with their family

(Haddock & Spaulding, 2011). Therefore, educating families on the course of the illness, as well

as ways to recognize onset of psychotic symptoms, is important to ensure optimal recovery.

Problem-solving is a crucial component in the family intervention model. Seeing as family

conflict can increase stress within the home, which in return can lead to worsening of psychotic

symptoms, family members benefit from learning effective methods of problem-solving to

address family conflicts. Additionally, teaching positive coping strategies for dealing with the

symptoms of mental illness and its direct effect on the family environment may also alleviate

some friction within the home

                                                12-24
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


        The third component, CBT, is similar to that described above. The goal of family-based

CBT is to reduce negativity among family member interactions, as well as help family members

adjust to living with someone with psychotic symptoms. These three components within the

family intervention program have been shown to reduce re-hospitalization rates, as well as slow

the worsening of schizophrenia-related symptoms (Pitschel-Walz, Leucht, Baumi, Kissling, &

Engel, 2001).

        12.5.3.1. Social Skills Training. Given the poor interpersonal functioning among

individuals with schizophrenia, social skills training is another type of treatment commonly

suggested to improve psychosocial functioning. Research has indicated that poor interpersonal

skills not only predate the onset of the disorder but also remain significant even with the

management of symptoms via antipsychotic medications. Impaired ability to interact with

individuals in a social, occupational, or recreational setting is related to poorer psychological

adjustment (Bellack, Morrison, Wixted, & Mueser, 1990). This can lead to greater isolation and

reduced social support among individuals with schizophrenia. As previously discussed, social

support has been identified as a protective factor of symptom exacerbation, as it buffers

psychosocial stressors that are often responsible for the exacerbation of symptoms. Learning how

to interact with others appropriately (e.g., establish eye contact, engage in reciprocal

conversations, etc.) through role-play in a group therapy setting is one effective way to teach

positive social skills.

        12.5.3.2. Inpatient Hospitalizations. More commonly viewed as community-based

treatments, inpatient hospitalization programs are essential in stabilizing patients in psychotic

episodes. Generally speaking, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis; however, there are

times when their symptoms exceed the needs of an outpatient service. Short-term

                                               12-25

hospitalizations are used to modify antipsychotic medications and implement additional

psychological treatments so that a patient can safely return to their home. These hospitalizations

generally last for a few weeks as opposed to a long-term treatment option that would last months

or years (Craig & Power, 2010).

         In addition to short-term hospitalizations, there are also partial hospitalizations where an

individual enrolls in a full-day program but returns home for the evening. These programs

provide individuals with intensive therapy, organized activities, and group therapy programs that

enhance social skills training. Research supports the use of partial hospitalizations as individuals

enrolled in these programs tend to do better than those who enter outpatient care (Bales et al.,

2014).

Module Recap

       In our first module of Part V – Block 4, we discussed the schizophrenia spectrum

disorders to include schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and

delusional disorder. We started by describing their common features, such as delusions,

hallucinations, disorganized thinking, disorganized/abnormal motor behavior, catatonic behavior,

and negative symptoms. This led to a discussion of the epidemiology, comorbidity, etiology, and

treatment options of the disorders.

13.1.1. Overview of Personality Disorders

       Personality disorders have four defining features, which include distorted thinking

patterns, problematic emotional responses, over- or under-regulated impulse control, and

interpersonal difficulties. While these four core features are universal among all ten personality

disorders, the DSM-5 divides the personality disorders into three different clusters based on

symptom similarities.



                                               13-3
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


       Cluster A is described as the odd/eccentric cluster and consists of Paranoid Personality

Disorder, Schizoid Personality Disorder, and Schizotypal Personality Disorder. The common

feature between these three disorders is social awkwardness and social withdrawal (APA, 2013).

Often these behaviors are similar to those seen in schizophrenia; however, they tend to be not as

extensive or impactful on daily functioning as seen in schizophrenia. In fact, there is a strong

relationship between cluster A personality disorders among individuals who have a relative

diagnosed with schizophrenia (Chemerinksi & Siever, 2011).

       Cluster B is the dramatic, emotional, or erratic cluster and consists of Antisocial

Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Histrionic Personality Disorder, and

Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Individuals with these personality disorders often experience

problems with impulse control and emotional regulation (APA, 2013). Due to the dramatic,

emotional, and erratic nature of these disorders, it is nearly impossible for individuals to establish

healthy relationships with others.

       And finally, Cluster C is the anxious/fearful cluster and consists of Avoidant Personality

Disorder, Dependent Personality Disorder, and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder. As

you read through the descriptions of the disorders, you will see an overlap with symptoms within

the anxiety and depressive disorders. Likely due to the similarity in symptoms with mental health

disorders that have effective treatment options, Cluster C disorders have the most treatment

options of all personality disorders.

       To meet the criteria for any personality disorder, the individual must display the pattern

of behaviors in adulthood. Children cannot be diagnosed with a personality disorder. Some

children may present with similar symptoms, such as poor peer relationships, odd or eccentric



                                                13-4
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


behaviors, or peculiar thoughts and language; however, a formal personality disorder diagnosis

cannot be made until the age of 18.



13.1.2. Cluster A

       13.1.2.1. Paranoid personality disorder. Paranoid personality disorder is characterized

by a marked distrust or suspicion of others. Individuals interpret and believe that other’s motives

and interactions are intended to harm them, and therefore, they are skeptical about establishing

close relationships outside of family members—although, at times, even family members’

actions are also believed to be malevolent (APA, 2013). Individuals with paranoid personality

disorder often feel as though they have been deeply and irreversibly hurt by others even though

they lack evidence to support that others intended to or did hurt them. Because of these persistent

suspicions, they will doubt relationships that show true loyalty or trustworthiness.

       Individuals with paranoid personality disorder are also hesitant to share any personal

information or confide in others as they fear the information will be used against them (APA,

2013). Additionally, benign remarks or events are often viewed as demeaning or threatening. For

example, if an individual with paranoid personality disorder was accidentally bumped into at the

store, they would interpret this action as intentional, with the purpose of causing them injury.

Because of this, individuals with paranoid personality disorder are quick to hold grudges and

unwilling to forgive insults or injuries- whether intentional or not (APA, 2013). They are known

to quickly and angrily counterattack, either verbally or physically, in situations where they feel

they were insulted.




                                               13-5
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


       13.1.2.2. Schizoid personality disorder. Individuals with schizoid personality disorder

display a persistent pattern of avoidance of social relationships, along with a limited range of

emotion among social relationships (APA, 2013). Similar to those with paranoid personality

disorder, individuals with schizoid personality disorder do not have many close relationships;

however, unlike paranoid personality disorder, this lack of connection is not due to suspicious

feelings, but rather, the lack of desire to engage with others and the preference to engage in

solitary behaviors. Individuals with schizoid personality disorder are often viewed as “loners”

and prefer activities where they do not have to engage with others (APA, 2013). Established

relationships rarely extend outside that of the family as they make no effort to start or maintain

friendships. This lack of establishing social relationships also extends to sexual behaviors, as

these individuals report a lack of interest in engaging in sexual experiences with others.

       Regarding the limited range of emotion, individuals with schizoid personality disorder

are often indifferent to criticisms or praises of others and appear not to be affected by what

others think of them (APA, 2013). Individuals will rarely show any feelings or expressions of

emotion and are often described as having a “bland” exterior (APA, 2013). In fact, individuals

with schizoid personality disorder rarely reciprocate facial expressions or gestures typically

displayed in normal conversations such as smiles or nods. Because of this lack of emotion, there

is a limited need for attention or acceptance.

       13.1.2.3. Schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder is

characterized by a range of impairment in social and interpersonal relationships due to

discomfort in relationships, along with odd cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentric

behaviors (APA, 2013). Similar to those with schizoid personality disorder, individuals also seek

isolation and have few, if any established relationships outside of family members.

                                                 13-6
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


       One of the most prominent features of schizotypal personality disorder is ideas of

reference, or the belief that unrelated events pertain to them in a particular and unusual way.

Ideas of reference also lead to superstitious behaviors or preoccupation with paranormal

activities that are not generally accepted in their culture (APA, 2013). The perception of special

or magical powers, such as the ability to mind-read or control other’s thoughts, has also been

documented in individuals with schizotypal personality disorder. Similar to schizophrenia,

unusual perceptual experiences such as auditory hallucinations, as well as unusual speech

patterns of derailment or incoherence, are also present.

       Similar to the other personality disorders within cluster A, there is a component of

paranoia or suspiciousness of other’s motives. Additionally, individuals with schizotypal

personality disorder display inappropriate or restricted affect, thus impacting their ability to

appropriately interact with others in a social context. Significant social anxiety is often also

present in social situations, particularly in those involving unfamiliar people. The combination of

limited affect and social anxiety contributes to their inability to establish and maintain personal

relationships; most individuals with schizotypal personality disorder prefer to keep to themselves

in an effort to reduce this anxiety.



13.1.3. Cluster B

       13.1.3.1. Antisocial personality disorder. The essential feature of antisocial personality

disorder is the persistent pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others. This

pattern of behavior begins in late childhood or early adolescence and continues throughout

adulthood. While this behavior presents before age 15, the individual cannot be diagnosed with

antisocial personality disorder until the age of 18. Prior to age 18, the individual would be

                                                 13-7
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


diagnosed with Conduct Disorder. Although not discussed in this book as it is a disorder of

childhood, conduct disorder involves a repetitive and persistent pattern of behaviors that violate

the rights of others or major age-appropriate norms (APA, 2013). Common behaviors of

individuals with conduct disorder that go on to develop antisocial personality disorder are

aggression toward people or animals, destruction of property, deceitfulness or theft, or serious

violation of rules (APA, 2013).

       While commonly referred to as “psychopaths” or “sociopaths,” individuals with

antisocial personality disorder fail to conform to social norms. This also includes legal rules as

individuals with antisocial personality disorder are often repeatedly arrested for property

destruction, harassing/assaulting others, or stealing (APA, 2013). Deceitfulness is another

hallmark symptom of antisocial personality disorder as individuals often lie repeatedly, generally

as a means to gain profit or pleasure. There is also a pattern of impulsivity—decisions made in

the moment without forethought of personal consequences or consideration for others (Lang et

al., 2015). This impulsivity also contributes to their inability to hold jobs as they are more likely

to impulsively quit their jobs (Hengartner et al., 2014). Employment instability, along with

impulsivity, also impacts their ability to manage finances; it is not uncommon to see individuals

with antisocial personality disorder with large debts that they are unable to pay (Derefinko &

Widiger, 2016).

       While also likely related to impulsivity, individuals with antisocial personality disorder

tend to be extremely irritable and aggressive, repeatedly getting into fights. The marked

disregard for their safety, as well as the safety of others, is also observed in reckless behavior

such as speeding, driving under the influence, and engaging in sexual and substance abuse

behavior that may put themselves at risk (APA, 2013).

                                                13-8
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


         Of course, the most known and devastating symptom of antisocial personality disorder is

the lack of remorse for the consequences of their actions, regardless of how severe they may be

(APA, 2013). Individuals often rationalize their actions as the fault of the victim, minimize the

harmfulness of the consequences of their behaviors, or display indifference (APA, 2013).

Overall, individuals with antisocial personality disorder have limited personal relationships due

to their selfish desire and lack of moral conscience.

         13.1.3.2. Borderline personality disorder. Individuals with borderline personality

disorder display a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and

affect (APA, 2013). The combination of these symptoms causes significant impairment in

establishing and maintaining personal relationships. They will often go to great lengths to avoid

real or imagined abandonment. Fears related to abandonment often lead to inappropriate anger as

they often interpret the abandonment as a reflection of their own behaviors. It is not uncommon

to experience intense fluctuations in mood, often observed as volatile interactions with family

and friends (Herpertz & Bertsch, 2014). Those with borderline personality disorder may be

friendly one day and hostile the next.

         In an effort to prevent abandonment, individuals with borderline personality disorder will

often exhibit impulsive behaviors such as self-harm and suicidal behavior. In fact, individuals

with borderline personality disorder engage in more suicide attempts, and completion of suicide

is higher among these individuals than the general public (Linehan et al., 2015). Other impulsive

behaviors, such as non-suicidal self-injury (cutting) and sexual promiscuity, are frequently seen

within this population, typically occurring during high-stress periods (Sansone & Sansone,

2012).



                                                13-9
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


         Another key characteristic of borderline personality disorder is unstable and intense

relationships. For example, individuals may idealize or experience intense feelings for another

person immediately after meeting them. Occasionally, hallucinations and delusions are present,

particularly of a paranoid nature; however, these symptoms are often transient and recognized as

unacceptable by the individual (Sieswerda & Arntz, 2007).

         13.1.3.3. Histrionic personality disorder. Histrionic personality disorder is the first

personality disorder that addresses pervasive and excessive emotionality and attention-seeking.

These individuals are usually uncomfortable in social settings unless they are the center of

attention. To help gain attention, the individual is often vivacious and dramatic, using physical

gestures and mannerisms along with grandiose language. These behaviors are initially very

charming to their audience; however, they begin to wear due to the constant need for attention to

be on them. If the theatrical nature does not gain the attention they desire, they may go to great

lengths to draw attention, such as using a fictitious story or creating a dramatic scene (APA,

2013).

         To ensure they gain the attention they desire, individuals with histrionic personality

disorder frequently dress and engage in sexually seductive or provocative ways. These sexually

charged behaviors are not only directed at those in which they have a sexual or romantic interest

but to the general public as well (APA, 2013). They often spend a significant amount of time on

their physical appearance to gain the attention they desire.

         Individuals with histrionic personality disorder are easily suggestible. Their opinions and

feelings are influenced by not only their friends but also by current fads (APA, 2013). They also

tend to exaggerate relationships, considering casual acquaintanceships as more intimate than they

are.

                                                13-10
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


       13.1.3.4. Narcissistic personality disorder. Similar to histrionic personality disorder,

narcissistic personality disorder also centers around the individual; however, with narcissistic

personality disorder, individuals display a pattern of grandiosity along with a lack of empathy for

others (APA, 2013). The grandiose sense of self leads to an overvaluation of their abilities and

accomplishments. They often come across as boastful and pretentious, repeatedly proclaiming

their superior achievements. These proclamations may also be fantasized as a means to enhance

their success or power. Oftentimes they identify themselves as “special” and will only interact

with others of high status.

       Given the grandiose sense of self, it is not surprising that individuals with narcissistic

personality disorder need excessive admiration from others. While it appears that their self-

esteem is hugely inflated, it is very fragile and dependent on how others perceive them (APA,

2013). Because of this, they may constantly seek out compliments and expect favorable

treatment from others. When this sense of entitlement is not upheld, they can become irritated or

angry that their needs are not met.

       A lack of empathy is also displayed in individuals with narcissistic personality disorder

as they often struggle to (or choose not to) recognize the desires or needs of others. This lack of

empathy also leads to exploitation of interpersonal relationships, as they are unable to understand

other’s feelings (Marcoux et al., 2014). They often become envious of others who achieve

greater success or possessions than them. Conversely, they believe everyone should be envious

of their achievements, regardless of how small they may actually be.

13.1.4. Cluster C

       13.1.4.1. Avoidant personality disorder. Individuals with avoidant personality disorder

display a pervasive pattern of social anxiety due to feelings of inadequacy and increased

sensitivity to negative evaluations (APA, 2013). The fear of being rejected drives their reluctance

to engage in social situations, so that they may prevent others from evaluating them negatively.

This fear extends so far that it prevents individuals from maintaining employment due to their

intense fear of negative evaluation or rejection.

       Socially, they have very few if any friends, despite their desire to establish social

relationships. They actively avoid social situations in which they can develop new friendships

out of the fear of being disliked or ridiculed. Similarly, they are cautious of new activities or

relationships as they often exaggerate the potential negative consequences and embarrassment

that may occur; this is likely a result of their ongoing preoccupation with being criticized or

rejected by others.

       Despite their view as socially inept, unappealing, or inferior, individuals with avoidant

personality disorder do not typically suffer from social skills deficits, but rather from

misattributions of their behaviors (APA, 2013).

       13.1.4.2. Dependent personality disorder. Dependent personality disorder is

characterized by pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of by others (APA, 2013). This

intense need leads to submissive and clinging behaviors as they fear they will be abandoned or

separated from their parent, spouse, or another person with whom they are in a dependent

relationship. They are so dependent on this other individual that they cannot make even the

smallest decisions without first consulting with them and gaining their approval or reassurance.

They often allow others to assume complete responsibility for their life, making decisions in

                                                13-12
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


nearly all aspects of their lives. Rarely will they challenge these decisions as their fear of losing

this relationship greatly outweighs their desire to express their own opinion. Should the

relationship end, the individual experiences significant feelings of helplessness and quickly seeks

out another relationship to replace the old one (APA, 2013).

       When they are on their own, individuals with dependent personality disorder express

difficulty initiating and engaging in tasks on their own. They lack self-confidence and feel

helpless when they are left to care for themselves or engage in tasks on their own. So that they do

not have to engage in tasks alone, individuals will go to great lengths to seek out support of

others, often volunteering for unpleasant tasks if it means they will get the reassurance they need

(APA, 2013).

       13.1.4.3. Obsessive-Compulsive personality disorder. OCPD is defined by an

individual’s preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and ability to control situations that

they lose flexibility, openness, and efficiency in everyday life (APA, 2013). One’s preoccupation

with details, rules, lists, order, organization, or schedules overshadows the larger picture of the

task or activity. In fact, the need to complete the task or activity is significantly impacted by the

individual’s self-imposed high standards and need to complete the task perfectly, that the task

often does not get completed. The desire to complete the task perfectly often causes the

individual to spend an excessive amount of time on the task, occasionally repeating it until it is to

their standard. Due to repetition and attention to fine detail, the individual often does not have

time to engage in leisure activities or engage in social relationships. Despite the excessive

amount of time spent on activities or tasks, individuals with OCPD will not seek help from

others, as they are convinced that the others are incompetent and will not complete the task up to

their standard.

                                                13-13
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


       Personally, individuals with OCD are rigid and stubborn, particularly with their morals,

ethics, and values. Not only do they hold these standards for themselves, but they also expect

others to have similarly high standards, thus causing significant disruption to their social

interactions. The rigid and stubborn behaviors are also seen in their financial status, as they are

known to live significantly below their means to prepare financially for a potential catastrophe

(APA, 2013). Similarly, they may have difficulty discarding worn-out or worthless items, despite

their lack of sentimental value.

       While some argue that OCPD and OCD are one and the same, others believe there is a

distinct difference as the personality disorder lacks definitive obsessions and compulsions (APA,

2013). Although many individuals are diagnosed with both OCD and OCPD, research indicates

that individuals with OCPD are more likely to be diagnosed with major depression, generalized

anxiety disorder, or substance abuse disorder than OCD (APA, 2013).

     Section 13.1 Review Questions

           1. What are the three clusters? How are disorders grouped into these three clusters?
              Discuss the differences in symptom presentation between the three personality
              clusters.
           2. Create a chart identifying each of the disorders among the three clusters. Be sure to
              include personality characteristics of each disorder. It is important to find
              characteristics unique to each personality disorder to aid in their identification.




                                       13.2. Epidemiology



Section Learning Objectives

       •    Describe the epidemiology of Cluster A personality disorders.

       •    Describe the epidemiology of Cluster B personality disorders.

       •    Describe the epidemiology of Cluster C personality disorders.



13.2.1. Cluster A

       Disorders within Cluster A have a prevalence rate of around 3-4%. More specifically,

paranoid personality disorder is estimated to affect approximately 4.4% of the general

population, with no reported diagnosis discrepancy between genders (APA, 2013). Schizoid

personality disorder occurs in 3.1% of the general population, whereas prevalence rate for

schizotypal personality disorder is 3.9%. Both schizoid and schizotypal personality disorders are

more commonly diagnosed in males than females, with males also reportedly being more

impaired by the diagnosis than females (APA, 2013).



                                               13-16
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


13.2.2. Cluster B

       Cluster B personality disorders have a wide range of occurrences in the general public.

Antisocial personality disorder has an estimated prevalence rate of up to 3.3% of the population

(APA, 2013). It is more common among men, particularly those with substance abuse disorders,

and in those from disadvantaged socioeconomic settings. While the majority of individuals with

antisocial personality disorder end up incarcerated at some point during their lifetime, criminal

activities appear to decline after the age of 40 (APA, 2013).

       Borderline personality disorder, one of the more commonly diagnosed personality

disorders, is observed in 5.9% of the general population, with women making up 75% of the

diagnoses (APA, 2013). Among 10% of individuals with borderline personality disorder have

been seen in an outpatient mental health clinic, and nearly 20% have sought treatment in a

psychiatric inpatient unit (APA, 2013). This high percentage of inpatient treatment is likely

related to the high incidence of suicidal and self-harm behaviors.

       Histrionic personality disorder is one of the most uncommon personality disorders,

occurring in only 1.84% of the general population (APA, 2013). While it was once believed to be

more commonly diagnosed in females than males, more recent findings suggest the diagnosis

rate is equal between genders.

       Finally, narcissistic personality disorder is reportedly diagnosed in 6.2% of the general

public, with 75% of these individuals being men (APA, 2013).



13.2.3. Cluster C

       Aside from OCPD, Cluster C personality disorders are rarely diagnosed in the general

public. For example, avoidant personality disorder occurs in 2.4% of the general population,

                                              13-17
                                                                      2nd edition as of August 2020


whereas dependent personality disorder occurs in less than 1% of the population (APA, 2013).

While avoidant personality is diagnosed equally among men and women, women are more

frequently diagnosed with dependent personality disorder than men. (APA, 2013).

       OCPD is the most commonly diagnosed personality disorder, occurring in 7.9% of

individuals. Some argue that OCPD and OCD should be combined into one disorder; however,

interestingly enough, more women are diagnosed with OCD than men, yet men are twice as

likely to be diagnosed with OCPD than women (APA, 2013). This may suggest that there is a

legitimate significant difference within the etiology of the two disorders.



       You should have learned the following in this section:
           •   Disorders within Cluster A have a prevalence rate of around 3-4% with
               males being diagnosed at higher rates for schizoid and schizotypal
               personality disorders.
           •   Antisocial personality disorder has an estimated prevalence rate of up to
               3.3% of the population while borderline personality disorder is around 5.9%.
               Histrionic only occurs in 1.84% of the general population and narcissistic in
               6.2%. Antisocial and narcissistic are more common in men, borderline more
               common in women, and males and females having an equal rate of diagnosis
               in histrionic.
           •   As for Cluster C, these personality disorders are rarely diagnosed in the
               general population with the exception being OCPD which is diagnosed in
               almost 8% of individuals.

                                       13.3. Comorbidity

Section Learning Objectives

       •     Describe the comorbidity of personality disorders.



       Among the most common comorbid diagnoses with personality disorders are mood

disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse disorders (Lenzenweger, Lane, Loranger, &

Kessler, 2007). A large meta-analysis exploring the data on the comorbidity of major depressive

disorder and personality disorders indicated a high diagnosis of major depressive disorder,

bipolar disorder, and dysthymia (Friborg, Martinsen, Martinussen, Kaiser, Overgard, &

Rosenvinge, 2014). Further exploration of major depressive disorder suggested the lowest rate of

diagnosis in cluster A disorders, higher rate in cluster B disorders, and the highest rate in cluster

C disorders. While the relationship between bipolar disorder and personality disorders has not

been consistently clear, the most recent findings report a high comorbidity rate between cluster B

personality disorders, with the exception of OCPD (which is in Cluster C), which had the highest

comorbidity rate than any other personality disorder. Overall analysis of dysthymia suggested

that it is the most commonly diagnosed major depressive disorder among all personality

disorders.

       A more detailed analysis exploring the prevalence rates of the four main anxiety

disorders (generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), specific phobia, social phobia, and panic

disorder) among individuals with various personality disorders found a clear relationship specific

to personality disorders and anxiety disorders (Skodol, Geier, Grant, & Hasin, 2014). More

specifically, individuals diagnosed with borderline and schizotypal personality disorders were

found to have an additional diagnosis of one of the four main anxiety disorders. Individuals with
                                                13-19

narcissistic personality disorders were more likely to be diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder;

schizoid and avoidant personality disorders reported significant rates of GAD; avoidant

personality disorder had a higher diagnosis rate of social phobia. Substance abuse disorders

occur less frequently across the ten personality disorders but are most common in individuals

diagnosed with antisocial, borderline, and schizotypal personality disorders (Grant et al., 2015).



     You should have learned the following in this section:
         •   Mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse disorders have a high
             comorbidity with personality disorders.
         •   Substance abuse disorders occur less frequently across the ten personality
             disorders but when they do, are comorbid with antisocial, borderline, and
             schizotypal personality disorders.

                                         13.4. Etiology



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the biological causes of personality disorders.

       •   Describe the psychological causes of personality disorders.

       •   Describe the social causes of personality disorders.



       Research regarding the development of personality disorders is limited compared to that

of other mental health disorders. The following is a general overview of contributing factors to

personality disorders as a whole. While there is some research lending itself to specific causes of

specific personality disorders, the overall contribution of biological, psychological, and social

factors will be reviewed.



13.4.1. Biological

       Research across the personality disorders suggests some underlying biological or genetic

component; however, identification of specific mechanisms have not been identified in most

disorders, with the exception of those below. Because of this lack of concrete evidence,

researchers argue that it is difficult to determine what role genetics plays into the development of

these disorders compared to that of environmental influences. Therefore, while there is likely a

biological predisposition to personality disorders, exact causes cannot be determined at this time.

Research on the development of schizotypal personality disorder has identified similar biological

causes to that of schizophrenia—high activity of dopamine and enlarged brain ventricles (Lener



                                               13-21
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


et al., 2015). Similar differences in neuroanatomy may explain the high similarity of behaviors in

both schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder.

          Surprisingly, antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder also

have similar neurological changes. More specifically, individuals with both disorders reportedly

show deficits in serotonin activity (Thompson, Ramos, & Willett, 2014). These low levels of

serotonin activity in combination with deficient functioning of the frontal lobes—particularly the

prefrontal cortex which is used in planning, self-control, and decision making—as well as an

overly reactive amygdala, may explain the impulsive and aggressive nature of both antisocial and

borderline personality disorder (Stone, 2014).



13.4.2. Psychological

          Psychodynamic, cognitive, and behavioral theories are among the most common

psychological models used to explain the development of personality disorders. Although much

is still speculation, the following are general etiological views with regards to each specific

theory.

          13.4.2.1. Psychodynamic. The psychodynamic theory places a large emphasis on

negative early childhood experiences and how these experiences impact an individual’s inability

to establish healthy relationships in adulthood. More specifically, individuals with personality

disorders report higher levels of childhood stress, such as living in impoverished environments,

exposure to domestic violence, and experiencing repeated maltreatment (Kumari et al., 2014).

Additionally, high levels of childhood neglect and parental rejection are also observed in

personality disorder patients, with early parental loss and rejection leading to fears of



                                                 13-22
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


abandonment throughout an individual’s life (Caligor & Clarkin, 2010; Newnham & Janca,

2014; Roepke & Varter, 2014).

       Psychodynamic theorists believe that maltreatment in early childhood has the potential to

negatively affect an individual’s sense of self and their perception of others, leading to the

development of a personality disorder. For example, an individual who was neglected as a young

child and deprived of love may report a lack of trust in others as an adult, a characteristic of

antisocial personality disorder (Meloy & Yakeley, 2010). Difficulty trusting others or beliefs that

they are unable to be loved may also impact one’s ability or desire to establish social

relationships, as seen in many personality disorders, particularly schizoid. Because of these early

childhood deficits, individuals may also overcompensate in their relationships in efforts to

convince themselves that they are worthy of love and affection (Celani, 2014). Conversely,

individuals may respond to their early childhood experiences by becoming emotionally distant,

using relationships as a sense of power and destructiveness.

       13.4.2.2. Cognitive. While psychodynamic theory emphasizes early childhood

experiences, cognitive theorists focus on the maladaptive thought patterns and cognitive

distortions displayed by those with personality disorders. Overall deficiencies in thinking can

lead individuals with personality disorders to develop inaccurate perceptions of others (Beck,

2015). These dysfunctional beliefs likely originate from the interaction between a biological

predisposition and undesirable environmental experiences. Maladaptive thought patterns and

strategies are strengthened during aversive life events as a protective mechanism and ultimately

come together to form patterns of behavior displayed in personality disorders (Beck, 2015).

       Cognitive distortions such as dichotomous thinking, also known as all-or-nothing

thinking, are observed in several personality disorders. More specifically, dichotomous thinking

                                               13-23
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


explains rigidity and perfectionism in OCPD, and the lack of self-sufficiency among individuals

with dependent and borderline personality disorders (Weishaar & Beck, 2006). Discounting the

positive also explains the underlying mechanisms for avoidant personality disorder (Weishaar &

Beck, 2006). For example, individuals who have been routinely criticized or rejected during

childhood may have difficulty accepting positive feedback from others, expecting only to receive

rejection and harsh criticism. In fact, they may employ these misattributions to positive feedback

to support their ongoing theory that they are constantly rejected and criticized by others.

       13.4.2.3. Behavioral. Behavioral theorists apply three major theories to explain the

development of personality disorders: modeling, reinforcement, and lack of social skills. In

modeling, an individual learns maladaptive social patterns and behaviors by directly observing

family members engaging in similar behaviors (Gaynor & Baird, 2007). While we cannot

discredit the biological component of the familial influence, research does support an additive

modeling or imitating component to the development of personality disorders, especially

antisocial personality disorder (APA, 2013).

       Reinforcement, or rewarding of maladaptive behaviors is also observed in the

development of many personality disorders. Parents may unintentionally reward aggressive

behaviors by giving in to a child’s desires in an effort to cease the situation or prevent escalation

of behaviors. When this is done repeatedly over time, children (and later as adults) continue with

these maladaptive behaviors as they are effective in gaining their needs and wants. On the other

side, there is some speculation that excessive reinforcement or praise during childhood may

contribute to the grandiose sense of self observed in individuals with narcissistic personality

disorder (Millon, 2011).



                                                13-24
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


         Finally, failure to develop normal social skills may explain the development of some

personality disorders, such as avoidant personality disorder (Kantor, 2010). While there is some

discussion as to whether lack of social skills leads to avoidance of social settings, or if social

skills deficits develop as a result of avoiding social situations, most researchers agree that the

avoidance of social situations contributes to the development of personality disorders, whereas,

underlying deficits in social skills may contribute more to social anxiety disorder (APA, 2013).



13.4.3. Social

         13.4.3.1. Family dysfunction. High levels of psychological and social dysfunction

within families have also been identified as contributing factors to the development of

personality disorders. High levels of poverty, unemployment, family separation, and witnessing

domestic violence are routinely observed in individuals diagnosed with personality disorders

(Paris, 1996). While formalized research has yet to explore the relationship between SES and

personality disorders fully, correlational studies suggest a link between poverty, unemployment,

and poor academic achievement with increased levels of personality disorder diagnoses (Alwin,

2006).

         13.4.3.2. Childhood maltreatment. Childhood maltreatment is among the most

influential argument for the development of personality disorders in adulthood. Individuals with

personality disorders often struggle with a sense of self and the ability to relate to others—

something that is generally developed during the first four to six years of a child’s life, and it is

affected by the emotional environment in which that child was raised. This sense of self is the

mechanism in which individuals view themselves within their social context, while also

informing attitudes and expectations of others. A child who experiences significant

                                                13-25
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


maltreatment, whether it be through neglect or physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, is at-risk for

an underdeveloped or absent sense of self. Due to the lack of affection, discipline, or autonomy

during childhood, these individuals are unable to engage in appropriate relationships as adults as

seen across the spectrum of personality disorders.

       Another way childhood maltreatment contributes to personality disorders is through the

emotional bonds or attachments developed with primary caregivers. John Bowlby thoroughly

researched the relationship between attachment and emotional development as he explored the

need for affection in Harlow monkeys (Bowlby, 1998). Based on Bowlby’s research, four

attachment styles have been identified: secure, anxious, ambivalent, and disorganized. While

securely attached children generally do not develop personality disorders, those with anxious,

ambivalent, and disorganized attachment are at an increased risk of developing various disorders.

More specifically, those with an anxious attachment are at-risk for developing internalizing

disorders, ambivalent are at-risk for developing externalizing disorders, and disorganized are at-

risk for dissociative symptoms and personality-related disorders (Alwin, 2006).

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   Biological causes of personality disorders have not been identified in most
       disorders, the exception being schizotypal which has similar biological
       causes as schizophrenia and antisocial and borderline personality disorders
       which have similar neurological changes.
   •   Psychological causes of personality disorders include negative early
       childhood experiences; maladaptive thought patterns and cognitive
       distortions; and modeling, reinforcement, and lack of social skills.
   •   Social causes of personality disorders include high levels of psychological
       and social dysfunction within families and maltreatment.

                                         13.5. Treatment



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe treatment options for personality disorders.



13.5.1. Cluster A

       Individuals with personality disorders within Cluster A often do not seek out treatment as

they do not identify themselves as someone who needs help (Millon, 2011). Of those that do seek

treatment, the majority do not enter it willingly. Furthermore, due to the nature of these

disorders, individuals in treatment often struggle to trust the clinician as they are suspicious of

the clinician’s intentions (paranoid and schizotypal personality disorder) or are emotionally

distant from the clinician as they do not have a desire to engage in treatment due to lack of

overall emotion (schizoid personality disorder; Kellett & Hardy, 2014, Colli, Tanzilli, Dimaggio,

& Lingiardi, 2014). Because of this, treatment is known to move very slowly, with many patients

dropping out before any resolution of symptoms.

       When patients are enrolled in treatment, cognitive-behavioral strategies are most

commonly used with the primary intention of reducing anxiety-related symptoms. Additionally,

attempts at cognitive restructuring—both identifying and changing maladaptive thought

patterns—are also helpful in addressing the misinterpretations of other’s words and actions,

particularly for individuals with paranoid personality disorder (Kellett & Hardy, 2014). Schizoid

personality disorder patients may engage in CBT techniques to help experience more positive

emotions and more satisfying social experiences, whereas the goal of CBT for schizotypal

personality disorder is to evaluate unusual thoughts or perceptions objectively and to ignore the
                                                13-28

inappropriate thoughts (Beck & Weishaar, 2011). Finally, behavioral techniques such as social-

skills training may also be implemented to address ongoing interpersonal problems displayed in

the disorders.



13.5.2. Cluster B

       13.5.2.1. Antisocial personality disorder. Treatment options for antisocial personality

disorder are limited and generally not effective (Black, 2015). Like Cluster A disorders, many

individuals are forced to participate in treatment, thus impacting their ability to engage in and

continue with treatment. Cognitive therapists have attempted to address the lack of morality and

encourage patients to think about the needs of others (Beck & Weishaar, 2011).

       13.5.2.2. Borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder is the one

personality disorder with an effective treatment option—Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT).

DBT is a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy developed by Marsha Linehan (Linehan,

Armstrong, Suarez, Allmon, & Heard, 1991). There are four main goals of DBT: reduce suicidal

behavior, reduce therapy interfering behavior, improve quality of life, and reduce post-traumatic

stress symptoms.

       Within DBT, five main treatment components collectively help to reduce harmful

behaviors (i.e., self-mutilation and suicidal behaviors) and replace them with practical, life-

enhancing behaviors (Gonidakis, 2014). The first component is skills training. Generally

performed in a group therapy setting, individuals engage in mindfulness, distress tolerance,

interpersonal effectiveness, and emotion regulation. Second, individuals focus on enhancing

motivation and applying skills learned in the previous component to specific challenges and

events in their everyday life. The third, and often the most distinctive aspect of DBT, is the use

                                               13-29
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


of telephone and in vivo coaching for DBT patients from the DBT clinical team. It is not

uncommon for patients to have the cell phone number of their clinician for 24/7 availability of

in-the-moment support. The fourth component, case management, consists of allowing the

patient to become their own “case manager” and effectively use the learned DBT techniques to

problem-solve ongoing issues. Within this component, the clinician will only intervene when

absolutely necessary. Finally, the consultation team, is a service for the clinicians providing the

DBT treatment. Due to the high demands of borderline personality disorder patients, the

consultation team offers support to the providers in their work to ensure they remain motivated

and competent in DBT principles to provide the best treatment possible.

       Support for the effectiveness of DBT in borderline personality disorder patients has been

implicated in several randomized control trials (Harned, Korslund, & Linehan, 2014; Neacsiu,

Eberle, Kramer, Wisemeann, & Linehan, 2014). More specifically, DBT has shown to

significantly reduce suicidality and self-harm behaviors in those with borderline personality

disorders. Additionally, the drop-out rates for treatment are extremely low, suggesting that

patients value the treatment components and find them useful in managing symptoms.

       13.5.2.3. Histrionic personality disorder. Individuals with histrionic personality

disorder are more likely to seek out treatment than other personality disorder patients.

Unfortunately, due to the nature of the disorder, they are very difficult patients to treat as they

are quick to employ their demands and seductiveness within the treatment setting. The overall

goal for the treatment of histrionic personality disorder is to help the patient identify their

dependency and become more self-reliant. Cognitive therapists utilize techniques to help patients

change their helpless beliefs and improve problem-solving skills (Beck & Weishaar, 2011).

       13.5.2.4. Narcissistic personality disorder. Of all the personality disorders, narcissistic

personality disorders are among the most difficult to treat (with maybe the exception of

antisocial personality disorder). Most individuals with narcissistic personality disorder only seek

out treatment for those disorders secondary to their personality disorder, such as depression

(APA, 2013). The focus of treatment is to address the grandiose, self-centered thinking, while

also trying to teach patients how to empathize with others (Beck & Weishaar, 2014).



13.5.3. Cluster C

       While many individuals within avoidant and OCPD personality disorders seek out

treatment to address their anxiety or depressive symptoms, it is often difficult to keep them in

treatment due to distrust or fear of rejection from the clinician. Treatment goals for avoidant

personality disorder are similar to that of social anxiety disorder. CBT techniques, such as

identifying and challenging distressing thoughts, have been effective in reducing anxiety-related

symptoms (Weishaar & Beck, 2006). Specific to OCPD, cognitive techniques aimed at changing

dichotomous thinking, perfectionism, and chronic worrying help manage symptoms of OCPD.

Behavioral treatments such as gradual exposure to various social settings, along with a

combination of social skills training, have been shown to improve individuals’ confidence prior

to engaging in social outings when treating avoidant personality disorder (Herbert, 2007).

Antianxiety and antidepressant medications commonly used to treat anxiety disorders have also

been used with minimal efficacy; furthermore, symptoms resume as soon as the medication is

discontinued.

       Unlike other personality disorders where individuals are skeptical of the clinician,

individuals with dependent personality disorder try to place obligations of their treatment on the

                                              13-31

clinician. Therefore, one of the main treatment goals for dependent personality disorder patients

is to teach them to accept responsibility for themselves, both in and outside of treatment (Colli,

Tanzilli, Dimaggio, & Lingiardi, 2014). Cognitive strategies such as challenging and changing

thoughts on helplessness and inability to care for oneself have been minimally effective in

establishing independence. Additionally, behavioral techniques such as assertiveness training

have also shown some promise in teaching individuals how to express themselves within a

relationship. Some argue that family or couples therapy would be particularly helpful for those

with dependent personality disorder due to the relationship between the patient and another

person being the primary issue; however, research on this treatment method has not yielded

consistently positive results (Nichols, 2013).


    You should have learned the following in this section:
        •   Individuals with a Cluster A personality disorder do not often seek treatment
            and when they do, struggle to trust the clinician (paranoid and schizotypal) or
            are emotionally distant from the clinician (schizoid). When in treatment,
            cognitive restructuring and cognitive behavioral strategies are used.
        •   In terms of Cluster B, treatment options for antisocial are limited and generally
            not effective, borderline responds well to dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT),
            histrionic patients seek out help but are difficult to work with, and finally
            narcissistic are the most difficult to treat.
        •   For Cluster C, cognitive techniques aid with OCPD while gradual exposure to
            various social settings and social skills training help with avoidant. Clinicians
            use cognitive strategies to challenge thoughts on helplessness in patients with
            dependent personality disorder.

       •   Describe how Major Neurocognitive Disorder presents itself.

       •   Describe how Mild Neurocognitive Disorder presents itself.



       Unlike many of the disorders we have discussed thus far, neurocognitive disorders often

result from disease processes or medical conditions. Therefore, it is important that individuals

presenting with these symptoms complete a medical assessment to better determine the etiology

behind the disorder.

       There are three main categories of neurocognitive disorders—Delirium, Major

Neurocognitive Disorder, and Mild Neurocognitive Disorder. Within major and minor

neurocognitive disorders are several subtypes due to the etiology of the disorder. For this book,

we will review diagnostic criteria for both major and minor neurocognitive disorders, followed

by a brief description of the various disease subtypes in the etiology section.



14.1.1. Delirium

       Delirium is characterized by a notable disturbance in attention or awareness and cognitive

performance that is significantly altered from one’s usual behavior (APA, 2013). Disturbances in

attention are often manifested as difficulty sustaining, shifting, or focusing attention.

Additionally, an individual experiencing an episode of delirium will have a disruption in

cognition, including confusion of where they are. Disorganized thinking, incoherent speech, and

hallucinations and delusions may also be observed during periods of delirium. The onset of

delirium is abrupt, occurring for several hours. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and can

last from days to several months.



14.1.2. Major Neurocognitive Disorder

       Individuals with major neurocognitive disorder show a significant decline in both overall

cognitive functioning as well as the ability to independently meet the demands of daily living

such as paying bills, taking medications, or caring for oneself (APA, 2013). While it is not

necessary, it is helpful to have documentation of the cognitive decline via neuropsychological

testing within a controlled, standardized testing environment. Information from close family

members or caregivers is also important in documenting the decline and impairment in areas of

functioning.

       Within the umbrella of major neurocognitive disorder is dementia, a striking decline in

cognition and self-help skills due to a neurocognitive disorder. The DSM-5 (APA, 2013)

refrained from using this term in diagnostic categories as it is often used to describe the natural

decline in degenerative dementias that affect older adults; whereas neurocognitive disorder is the

preferred term used to describe conditions affecting younger individuals such as impairment due

to traumatic brain injuries or other medical conditions. Therefore, while dementia is accurate in

describing those experiencing major neurocognitive disorder due to age, it is not reflective of

those experiencing neurocognitive issues secondary to an injury or illness.

14.1.3. Mild Neurocognitive Disorder

       Individuals with mild neurocognitive disorder demonstrate a modest decline in one of the

listed cognitive areas. The decline in functioning is not as extensive as that seen in major

neurocognitive disorder, and the individual does not experience difficulty independently

engaging in daily activities. However, they may require assistance or extra time to complete

these tasks, particularly if the cognitive decline continues to progress.

       It should be noted that the primary difference between major and mild neurocognitive

disorder is the severity of the decline and independent functioning. Some argue that the two are

earlier and later stages of the same disease process (Blaze, 2013). Conversely, individuals can go

from major to mild neurocognitive disorder following recovery from a stroke or traumatic brain

injury (Petersen, 2011).




    You should have learned the following in this section:
        •   Delirium is characterized by a notable disturbance in attention or awareness and
            cognitive performance that is significantly altered from one’s usual behavior.
        •   Major neurocognitive disorder is characterized by a significant decline in both
            overall cognitive functioning as well as the ability to independently meet the
            demands of daily living.
        •   Mild neurocognitive disorder is characterized by a modest decline in one of the
            listed cognitive areas.

                                       14.2. Epidemiology



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe the epidemiology of neurocognitive disorders.



       Delirium often occurs among those hospitalized for other medical issues (up to 24%) and

in older individuals. While the rate of occurrence is quite rare among the general public (1-2%),

it significantly increases to 14% among individuals older than 85 years old (APA, 2013).

       Major and mild neurocognitive disorder prevalence rates vary widely depending on the

etiological nature of the disorder. Dementia occurs in 1-2% of individuals at age 65, and up to

30% of individuals by age 85.

       Alzheimer’s disease, the most commonly diagnosed neurocognitive disorder, is observed

in nearly 5.5 million Americans (Alzheimer’s Association, 2017a), with 7% of those between

ages 65 and 74; 53% between 75 and 84; and 40% older than 84 (APA, 2013). It should also be

noted that somewhere between 60-90% of dementias are attributable to Alzheimer’s disease

(APA, 2013).

       Nearly 1.7 million traumatic brain injuries (TBI) happen each year within the United

States, with 59% of these injuries occurring in males (APA, 2013). The most common causes of

TBI are falls, automobile accidents, and accidental head strikes (APA, 2013). There has also

been an increase in TBI within the military due to the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

       You should have learned the following in this section:
           •   As individuals age, the rate of occurrence of delirium and dementia increases
               dramatically.
           •   As for Alzheimer’s disease, 53% of those afflicted with the disease are between
               the ages of 75 and 84 with another 40% above 84.

   Neurocognitive disorders occur due to a wide variety of medical conditions or injury to the

brain. Therefore, this section will focus on a brief description of the nine different etiologies of

neurocognitive disorders per the DSM-5. As you will see, the majority of these neurocognitive

disorders are both degenerative, meaning the symptoms and cognitive deficits become worse

over time, as well as related to a medical condition or disease.

       Per the DSM-5 (APA, 2013), an individual will meet diagnostic criteria for either mild or

major neurocognitive disorder as listed above. In order to specify the type of neurocognitive

disorder, additional diagnostic criteria specific to one of the following subtypes must be met.



14.3.1. Alzheimer’s Disease

       Alzheimer’s disease is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. While the primary

symptom of Alzheimer’s disease is the gradual progression of impairment in cognition, it is also

important to identify concrete evidence of cognitive decline. This can be done in one of two

ways: via genetic testing of the individual or a documented family history of the disease, or,

through clear evidence of cognitive decline over time by repeated standardized

neuropsychological evaluations (APA, 2013). It is crucial to identify these markers in making the

diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease as some individuals present with memory impairment but

eventually show a reversal of symptoms; this is not the case for individuals with Alzheimer’s

disease (APA, 2013).

       14.3.1.1. Causes of Alzheimer’s disease. Autopsies of individuals diagnosed with

Alzheimer’s disease identify two abnormal brain structures— beta-amyloid plaques and

neurofibrillary tangles— both of which are responsible for neuron death, inflammation, and

loss of cellular connections (Lazarov, Mattson, Peterson, Pimplika, & van Praag, 2010). It is

                                                14-8
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


believed that beta-amyloid plaques, large bundles of plaque that develop between neurons,

appear before the development of dementia symptoms. As these plaque bundles increase in size

and number, cognitive symptoms and impaired daily functioning become evident to close family

members. Neurofibrillary tangles are believed to appear after the onset of dementia symptoms

and are found inside of cells, affecting the protein that helps transport nutrients in healthy cells.

Both beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles impact the health of neurons within the

hippocampus, amygdala, and the cerebral cortex, areas associated with memory and cognition

(Spires-Jones & Hyman, 2014).

       Researchers have identified additional genetic and environmental influences in the

development of Alzheimer’s disorder. Genetically, the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) that helps to

eliminate beta-amyloid by-products from the brain has been implicated in the development of

Alzheimer’s disorder. One of the three variants of this gene, the e4 allele, appears to reduce the

production of ApoE, thus increasing the number of beta-amyloid plaques within the brain.

However, not all individuals with the e4 allele develop Alzheimer’s disease; therefore, this

explanation may better explain a vulnerability to Alzheimer’s disease as opposed to the cause of

the disease.

       Various brain regions have also been implicated in the development of Alzheimer’s

disease. More specifically, neurons shrinking or dying within the hypothalamus, thalamus, and

the locus ceruleus have been linked to declining cognition (Selkoe, 2011, 1992). Acetylcholine-

secreting neurons within the basal forebrain also appear to shrink or die, contributing to

Alzheimer’s disease symptoms (Hsu et al., 2015).

       Environmental toxins such as high levels of zinc and lead may also contribute to the

development of Alzheimer’s disease. More precisely, zinc has been linked to the clumping of

                                                 14-9
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


beta-amyloid proteins throughout the brain. Although lead has largely been phased out of

environmental toxins due to negative health consequences, current elderly individuals were

exposed to these toxic levels of lead in gasoline and paint as young children. There is some

speculation that lead and other pollutants may impact cognitive functioning in older adults

(Richardson et al., 2014).

       14.3.1.2. Onset of Alzheimer’s disease. Alzheimer’s disease is defined by the onset of

symptoms. Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease occurs before the age of 65. While only a small

percentage of individuals experience early onset of the disease, those that do experience early

disease progression appear to have a more genetically influenced condition and a higher rate of

family members with the disease.

       Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease occurs after the age of 65 and has less of a familial

influence. This onset appears to occur due to a combination of biological, environmental, and

lifestyle factors (Chin-Chan, Navarro-Yepes, & Quintanilla-Vega, 2015). Nearly 30% of

individuals within this class of diagnosis have the ApoE gene that fails to eliminate the beta-

amyloid proteins from various brain structures. It is believed that the combination of the

presence of this gene along with environmental toxins and lifestyle choices (i.e., more stress)

impact the development of Alzheimer’s disease.



14.3.2. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)

       TBIs occur when an individual experiences significant trauma or damage to the head.

Neurocognitive disorder due to TBI is diagnosed when persistent cognitive impairment is

observed immediately following the head injury, along with one or more of the following



                                               14-10
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


symptoms: loss of consciousness, posttraumatic amnesia, disorientation, and confusion, or

neurological impairment (APA, 2013).

       The presentation of symptoms varies among individuals and depends largely on the

location of the injury and the intensity of the trauma. Furthermore, the effects of a TBI can be

temporary or permeant. Symptoms generally range from headaches, disorientation, confusion,

irritability, fatigue, poor concentration, as well as emotional and behavioral changes. More

severe injuries can result in more significant neurological symptoms such as seizures, paralysis,

and visual disturbances (APA, 2013).

       The most common type of TBI is a concussion. A concussion occurs when there is a

significant blow to the head, followed by changes in brain functioning. It often causes immediate

disorientation or loss of consciousness, along with headaches, dizziness, nausea, and sensitivity

to light (Alla, Sullivan, & McCrory, 2012). While symptoms of a concussion are usually

temporary, there can be more permanent damage due to repeated concussions, particularly if they

are close in time. The media has brought considerable attention to this with the recent

discussions of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) which is a progressive, degenerative

condition due to repeated head trauma. CTEs are most commonly seen in athletes (i.e., football

players) and military personnel (Baugh et al., 2012). In addition to the neurological symptoms,

psychological symptoms such as depression and poor impulse control have been observed in

individuals with CTE. These individuals also appear to be at greater risk for the development of

dementia (McKee et al., 2013).

14.3.3. Vascular Disorders

       Neurocognitive disorders due to vascular disorders can occur from a one-time event such

as a stroke or ongoing subtle disruptions of blood flow within the brain (APA, 2013). The

occurrence of these vascular disorders general begins with atherosclerosis, or the clogging of

arteries due to a build-up of plaque. The plaque builds up over time, eventually causing the

artery to narrow, thus reducing the amount of blood able to pass through to other parts of the

body. When these arteries within the brain become entirely obstructed, a stroke occurs. The lack

of blood flow during a stroke results in the death of neurons and loss of brain function (APA,

2013). There are two types of strokes—a hemorrhagic stroke that occurs when a blood vessel

bursts within the brain and an ischemic stroke, which is when a blood clot blocks the blood flow

in an artery within the brain (American Stroke Association, 2017).

       While strokes can occur at any age, the majority of strokes occur after age 65 (Hall,

Levant, & DeFrances, 2012). A wide range of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional changes

occur following a stroke. Symptoms are generally dependent on the location of the stroke within

the brain as well as the extensiveness of damage to those brain regions (Poels et al., 2012). For

example, strokes that occur on the left side of the brain tend to cause problems with speech and

language, as well as physical movement on the right side of the body; whereas strokes that occur

on the right side of the brain tend to cause problems with impulsivity and impaired judgement,

short-term memory loss, and physical movement on the left side of the body (Hedna et al., 2013).



14.3.4. Substance Abuse

       As discussed in the Substance Abuse chapter, significant cognitive changes occur due to

repetitive drug and alcohol abuse. Delirium can be observed in individuals with extreme

                                              14-12

substance intoxication, withdrawal, or even when multiple substances have been used within a

close period (APA, 2013). While delirium symptoms are often transient during these states, mild

neurocognitive impairment due to heavy substance abuse may remain until a significant period

of abstinence is observed (Stavro, Pelletier, & Potvin, 2013).



14.3.5. Dementia with Lewy Bodies

       Symptoms associated with neurocognitive disorder due to Lewy bodies include

significant fluctuations in attention and alertness; recurrent visual hallucinations; impaired

mobility; and sleep disturbance (APA, 2013). While the trajectory of the illness develops more

rapidly than Alzheimer’s disease, the survival period is similar in that most individuals do not

survive longer than eight years post-diagnosis (Lewy Body Dementia Association, 2017).

       Lewy bodies are irregular brain cells that result from the buildup of abnormal proteins in

the nuclei of neurons. These brain cells deplete the cortex of acetylcholine, which causes the

behavioral and cognitive symptoms observed in both dementia with Lewy bodies and

Parkinson’s disease. The motor symptoms seen in both these disorders occur from the depletion

of dopamine by the Lewy body nerve cells that accumulate in the brain stem.



14.3.6. Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD)

       FTLD causes progressive declines in language or behavior due to the degeneration in the

frontal and temporal lobes of the brain (APA, 2013). Symptoms of FTLD include significant

changes in behavior or language. Individuals may present with apathy or disinhibition.

Additionally, they may lose interest in socialization as they often lose empathy and sympathy for

others. Individuals may also engage in perseverative or compulsive behaviors. Cognitive decline

                                               14-13

is generally not as prominent as the behavioral and language changes, showing minimal deficits

in early stages of the disorder; however, they will present with a decline in executive functions

such as poor planning and organization, distractibility, and poor judgement to name a few (APA,

2013).

         The language deficits commonly impact the fluency of speech and word meaning.

Individuals experience difficulties understanding words or naming objects (APA, 2013).

Occasionally, muscle weakness and other physical abnormalities are present, although not

necessary for diagnosis.



14.3.7. Parkinson’s Disease

         The awareness of Parkinson’s disease has increased in recent years due in large part to

Michael J. Fox’s early diagnosis in 1991. It is the second-most common neurodegenerative

disorder in the United States, affecting approximately 630,000 individuals (Kowal, Dall,

Chakrabarti, Storm, & Jain, 2013). While many are aware of the tremors of hands, arms, legs, or

face, additional symptoms of rigidity of the limbs and trunk; slowness in initiating movement;

and drooping posture or impaired balance and coordination, are the other three main symptoms

of Parkinson’s disease (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, 2017). These

motor symptoms are generally present at least one year prior to the beginning of cognitive

decline, although severity and progression of symptoms vary significantly from person to person.



14.3.8. Huntington’s Disease

         Huntington’s disease is a rare genetic disorder that involves involuntary movement,

progressive dementia, and emotional instability. Due to the degenerative nature of the disorder,

                                               14-14
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


there is a shortened life-expectancy as death typically occurs 15-20 years post-onset of

symptoms (Clabough, 2013). Although symptoms can present at any time, the average age of

symptom presentation is during middle adulthood (APA, 2013). Symptoms generally begin with

neurocognitive decline along with changes in mood and personality. As symptoms progress,

more physical symptoms present, such as facial grimaces, difficulty speaking, and repetitive

movements. Because there is no treatment for Huntington’s disease, the severity of the cognitive

and physical impairments ultimately leads to complete dependency and the need for full-time

care.



14.3.9. HIV Infection

        Not many people are aware that cognitive impairment is sometimes the first symptom of

untreated HIV. While symptoms vary among individuals, slower mental processing, difficulty

with complex tasks, and difficulty concentrating and learning new information are among the

most common early signs (APA, 2013). When HIV becomes active in the brain, significant

alterations of mental processes occur, thus leading to a diagnosis of neurocognitive disorder due

to HIV infection. Significant impairment can also occur due to HIV-infection related

inflammation throughout the central nervous system.

        Fortunately, antiretroviral therapies used in treating HIV have been effective in reducing

and preventing the onset of severe cognitive impairments; however, HIV-related brain changes

still occur in nearly half of all patients on antiretroviral medication. There is hope that once

antiretroviral therapies are able to cross the blood-brain barrier in the central nervous system,

there will be a significant improvement in the prevalence of HIV-related neurocognitive disorder

(Vassallo et al., 2014).

   •   Most neurocognitive disorders are degenerative meaning they become worse
       over time.
   •   Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by the gradual progression of
       impairment in cognition as well as the presence of beta-amyloid plaques and
       neurofibrillary tangles.
   •   TBIs occur when an individual experiences significant trauma or damage to
       the head with the most common type being a concussion.
   •    Vascular disorders generally begin with atherosclerosis which leads to a
       stroke.
   •   Significant cognitive changes occur due to repetitive drug and alcohol abuse
       such as delirium.
   •   Dementia with Lewy Bodies is characterized by significant fluctuations in
       attention and alertness; recurrent visual hallucinations; impaired mobility;
       and sleep disturbance.
   •   FTLD causes progressive declines in language or behavior due to the
       degeneration in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.

Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe treatment options for neurocognitive disorders.



       Treatment options for those with neurocognitive disorders are minimal at best, with most

attempting to treat secondary symptoms as opposed to the neurocognitive disorder itself.

Furthermore, the degenerative nature of these disorders also makes it difficult to treat, as many

diseases will progress regardless of the treatment options.



14.4.1. Pharmacological

       Pharmacological interventions, and more specifically medications designed to target

acetylcholine and glutamate, the primary neurotransmitters affected by the disease, have been the

most effective treatment options in alleviating symptoms and reducing the speed of cognitive

decline within individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Specific medications such as

donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), galantamine (Razadyne), and memantine (Namenda)

are among the most commonly prescribed (Alzheimer’s Association, 2017a). Due to possible

negative side effects of the medications, these drugs are prescribed to individuals in the early or

middle stages of Alzheimer’s as opposed to those with advanced disease. Researchers have also

explored treatment options aimed at preventing the build-up of beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary

tangles; however, this research is still in its infancy (Alzheimer’s Association, 2017a)

       Parkinson’s disease has also found success in pharmacological treatment options. The

medication levodopa increases dopamine availability, which provides relief of both physical and

                                               14-17
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


cognitive symptoms. Unfortunately, there are also significant side effects such as hallucinations

and psychotic symptoms; therefore, the medication is often only used when the benefits

outweigh the negatives of the potential risks (Poletti & Bonuccelli, 2013).



14.4.2. Psychological

       Among the most effective psychological treatment options for individuals with

neurocognitive disorders are the use of cognitive and behavioral strategies. More specifically,

engaging in various cognitive activities such as computer-based cognitive stimulation programs,

reading books, and following the news, have been identified as effective strategies in preventing

or delaying the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (Szalavits, 2013; Wilson, Segawa, Boyle, &

Bennett, 2012).

       Engaging in social skills and self-care training are additional behavioral strategies used to

help improve functioning in individuals with neurocognitive deficits. For example, by breaking

down complex tasks into smaller, more attainable goals, as well as simplifying the environment

(i.e., labeling location of items, removing clutter), individuals can successfully engage in more

independent living activities.



14.4.3. Support for Caregivers

       Supporting caregivers is an important treatment option to include as the emotional and

physical toll on caring for an individual with a neurocognitive disorder is often underestimated.

According to the Alzheimer’s Association (2017b), nearly 90% of all individuals with

Alzheimer’s disease are cared for by a relative. The emotional and physical demands on caring

for a family member who continues to cognitively and physically decline can lead to increased

                                              14-18
                                                                     2nd edition as of August 2020


anger and depression in a caregiver (Kang et al. 2014). It is important that medical providers

routinely assess caregivers’ psychosocial functioning, and encourage caregivers to participate in

caregiver support groups, or individual psychotherapy to address their own emotional needs.



    You should have learned the following in this section:
        •   Pharmacological interventions target the neurotransmitters acetylcholine and
            glutamate and newer research is focused on the build-up of beta-amyloid and
            neurofibrillary tangles.
        •   Psychological treatments include cognitive and behavioral strategies such as
            playing board games, reading books, or social skills training.
        •   Caregivers need to join support groups to help them manage their own anger
            and depression, especially since 90% of such caregivers are relatives of the
            afflicted.

15.1.1. Forensic Psychology/Psychiatry

       According to the American Psychological Association, forensic psychology/psychiatry

is when clinical psychology is applied to the legal arena in terms of assessment, treatment, and

evaluation. Forensic psychology can also include the application of research from other subfields

in psychology to include cognitive and social psychology. Training includes law and forensic

psychology, and solid clinical skills are a must. According to APA, a forensic psychologist might

“perform such tasks as threat assessment for schools, child custody evaluations, competency

evaluations of criminal defendants and of the elderly, counseling services to victims of crime,

death notification procedures, screening and selection of law enforcement applicants, the

assessment of post-traumatic stress disorder and the delivery and evaluation of intervention and

treatment programs for juvenile and adult offenders.” A key issue investigated by forensic

psychologists includes mens rea or the insanity plea. We will discuss this shortly.

15.1.2. Civil Commitment

       15.1.2.1. What is civil commitment? When individuals with mental illness behave in

erratic or potentially dangerous ways, to either themselves or others, then something must be

done. The responsibility to act falls on the government through what is called parens patriae or

“father of the country” or “country as parent.” Action, in this case, involves involuntary

commitment in a hospital or mental health facility and is done to protect the individual and

express concern over their well-being, much like a parent would do for their child. An individual

can voluntarily admit themselves to a mental health facility, and upon doing so, staff will

determine whether or not treatment and extended stay are needed.

       15.1.2.2. Criteria for civil commitment. Though states vary in the criteria used to

establish the need for civil commitment, some requirements are common across states. First, the

individual must present a clear danger to either themselves or others. Second, the individual

demonstrates that he/she is unable to care for him or herself or make decisions about whether



                                               15-4
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


treatment or hospitalization is necessary. Finally, the individual believes he/she is about to lose

control, and so, needs treatment or care in a mental health facility.

       15.1.2.3. Assessment of “dangerousness.” Dangerousness can best be defined as the

person’s capacity or likelihood of harming themselves or others. Most people believe that those

who are mentally ill are more dangerous than those free of mental illness, especially when

espousing self-reported conservatism and RWA (Right-Wing Authoritarianism; Gonzales, Chan,

and Yanos, 2017; DeLuca and Yanos, 2015) or after tragic events such as a mass shooting (Metzl

& MacLeish, 2015). The media plays a role in this, and as McGinty et al. (2014) found, 70% of

news coverage of serious mental illness (SMI) and gun violence over a 16-year period (1997 to

2012) focused on extreme events and described specific shootings by persons with SMI. The

authors wrote, “Even in thematic news coverage focused on describing the general problem of

SMI and gun violence, the majority of news stories did not mention that most people with SMI

are not violent or that we lack tools capable of accurately identifying persons with SMI who are

at heightened risk of committing future violence.” They concluded that media coverage of

persons with SMI as violent might contribute to negative public attitudes.

       Rozel & Mulvey (2017) showed that mental illness is a weak risk factor for violence

though this is not to say that the mentally ill do not commit violent acts. The authors write, “…it

has been documented repeatedly that people who report diagnosable levels of psychiatric

symptoms also report more involvement in acts of violence toward others than the general

population reports.” Approximately 4% of criminal violence can be attributed to the mentally ill

(Metzl & MacLeish, 2015), while those with mental illness are three times more likely to be

targets and not perpetrators of violence (Choe et al., 2008).



                                                15-5
                                                                        2nd edition as of August 2020


       Regardless of this, we do attempt to identify the level of dangerousness a person may

exhibit or have the potential to exhibit. How easy is it to make this prediction? As you might

think, it can be very difficult. First, the definition of dangerousness is vague. It implies physical

harm, but what about psychological abuse or the destruction of property? Second, past criminal

activity is a good predictor of future dangerousness but is often not admissible in court. Third,

context is critical; in some situations, the person is perfectly fine, but in other circumstances, like

having to wait in line at the DMV, the person experiences considerable frustration and eventually

anger or rage.

       15.1.2.4. Procedures in civil commitment. The process for civil commitment does vary

a bit from state to state, but some procedures are held in common. First, a family member,

mental health professional, or primary care practitioner, may request that the court order an

examination of an individual. If the judge agrees, two professionals, such as a mental health

professional or physician, are appointed to examine the person in terms of their ability for self-

care, need for treatment, psychological condition, and likelihood to inflict harm on self or others.

Next, a formal hearing gives the examiners a chance to testify as to what they found.

Testimonials may also be provided by family and friends, or by the individual him/herself. Once

testimonies conclude, the judge renders judgment about whether confinement is necessary and, if

so, for how long. Typical confinements last from 6 months to 1 year, but an indefinite period can

be specified too. In the latter case, the individual has periodic reviews and assessments. In

emergencies, the process stated above can be skipped and short-term commitment made,

especially if the person is an imminent threat to him/herself or others.

       Before we move on, consider for a minute that a person who is accused of a crime is

innocent until proven guilty, has a trial, and if found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt (or almost

                                                 15-6

complete certainty) is only then incarcerated. This is not true for the mentally ill, who may be

committed to a facility without ever having committed a crime or having a trial, but simply

because he or she was judged as having the potential to do so (or was seen as dangerous). This

potential means that there has to be “clear and convincing” proof, which the Supreme Court

defines as 75% certainty. The standard to commit is much different for those accused of criminal

acts and those who are mentally ill.



15.1.3. Criminal Commitment

       When people are accused of crimes but found to be mentally unstable, they are usually

sent to a mental health institution for treatment. This is called criminal commitment.

Individuals may plead not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) or as it is also called, the

insanity plea. When a defendant pleads NGRI they are acknowledging their guilt for the crime

(actus rea) but wish to be seen as not guilty since they were mentally ill at the time (mens rea).

The origins of the modern definition of insanity go back to Daniel M’Naghten in 1843 England.

He murdered the secretary to British Prime Minister, Robert Peel, during an attempted

assassination of the Prime Minister. He was found to be not guilty due to delusions of

persecution, which outraged the public and led to calls for a more precise definition of insanity.

The M’Naghten rule states that having a mental disorder at the time of a crime does not mean

the person was insane. The individual also had to be unable to know right from wrong, or

comprehend the act as wrong. But how do you know what the person’s level of awareness was

when the crime was committed?

       Dissatisfaction with the M’Haghten rule led some state and federal courts in the U.S. to

adopt instead the irresistible impulse test (1887), which focused on the inability of a person to

                                               15-7
                                                                       2nd edition as of August 2020


control their behaviors. The issue with this rule is in distinguishing when a person is unable to

maintain control rather than choosing not to exert control over their behavior. This meant there

were two choices in the U.S. in terms of how insanity was defined – the M’Haghten rule and the

irresistible impulse test. A third test emerged in 1954 from the Durham v. United States case,

though it was short-lived. The Durham test, or products test, stated that a person was not

criminally responsible if their crime was a product of a mental illness or defect. It offered some

degree of flexibility for the courts but was viewed as too flexible. Since almost anything can

cause something else, the term product is too vague.

       In 1962, the American Law Institute (ALI) offered a compromise to the three precepts in

use at the time. The American Law Institute standard stated that people are not criminally

responsible for their actions if, at the time of their crime, they had a mental disorder or defect

that did not allow them to distinguish right from wrong and to obey the law. Though this became

the standard, it also became controversial when defense attorneys used it as the basis to have

John Hinckley, accused of attempting to assassinate President Ronald Regan, found not guilty by

reason of insanity in 1982.

       Public uproar led the American Psychiatric Association to reiterate the stance of the

M’Naghten test and assert people were only insane if they did not know right from wrong when

they committed their crime. The Federal Insanity Defense Reform ACT (IDRA) of 1984 “was

the first comprehensive federal legislation governing the insanity defense and the disposition of

individuals suffering from a mental disease or defect who are involved in the criminal justice

system.” The ACT included the following provisions:

       •   significantly modified the standard for insanity previously applied in the federal

           courts

       •   placed the burden of proof on the defendant to establish the defense by clear and

           convincing evidence

       •   limited the scope of expert testimony on ultimate legal issues

       •   eliminated the defense of diminished capacity, created a special verdict of "not guilty

           only by reason of insanity," which triggers a commitment proceeding

       •   provided for federal commitment of persons who become insane after having been

           found guilty or while serving a federal prison sentence.

       This is the current standard in all federal courts and about half of all state courts, with

Idaho, Kansas, Montana, and Utah choosing to get rid of the insanity plea altogether.

       Another possibility is for the jury to deliver a verdict of guilty but mentally ill (GBMI),

effectively acknowledging that the person did have a mental disorder when committing a crime,

but the illness was not responsible for the crime itself. The jurors can then convict the accused

and suggest he or she receive treatment. Though this looks like an excellent alternative, jurors

are often confused by it (Melville & Naimark, 2002), NGRI verdicts have not been reduced, and

all prisoners have access to mental health care anyway. Hence it differs from a guilty verdict in

name only (Slovenko, 2011; 2009).

       A final concept critical to this discussion is whether the defendant is competent to stand

trial and refers to the accused’s mental state at the time of psychiatric examination after arrest

and before going to trial. To be deemed competent, federal law dictates that the defendant must

have a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings and be able to rationally consult

with counsel when presenting his/her defense (Mossman et al., 2007; Fitch, 2007). This

condition guarantees criminal and civil rights and ensures the accused understands what is going

on during the trial and can aid in his or her defense. If they are not fit or competent, then they can

be hospitalized until their mental state improves.

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   Forensic psychology is when clinical psychology is applied to the legal arena
       in terms of assessment, treatment, and evaluation, though it can include
       research from other subfields to include cognitive and social psychology.
   •   Civil commitment occurs when a person acts in potentially dangerous ways
       to themselves or others and can be initiated by the person or the government.
   •   Dangerousness is defined as the person’s capacity of harming themselves or
       others and implies physical harm but not necessarily psychological abuse or
       the destruction of property.
   •   Criminal commitment occurs when a person is accused of a crime but found
       to be mentally unstable.
   •   Several rules or tests have been attempt to determine if a person is
       responsible for their actions at the time a crime was committed. These
       include the M’Naghten rule, irresistible impulse test, Durham test, and the
       American Law Institute standard.

                                       15.2. Patient’s Rights



Section Learning Objectives

       •   Describe rights patients with mental illness have and identify key court cases.



The following are several rights that patients with mental illness have. They include:

       •   Right to Treatment – In the 1966 case of Rouse v. Cameron, the D.C. District court

           said that the right to treatment is a constitutional right, and failure to provide

           resources cannot be justified due to insufficient resources. In the 1972 case of Wyatt

           v. Stickney, a federal court ruled that the state of Alabama was constitutionally

           obligated to provide all people who were committed to institutions with adequate

           treatment and had to offer more therapists, privacy, exercise, social interactions, and

           better living conditions for patients. In the case of O’Connor v. Donaldson (1975), the

           court ruled that patient’s cases had to be reviewed periodically to see if they could be

           released. As well, if they are not a danger and are able to survive on their own or with

           help from family or friends, that they be released.

       •   Right to Refuse Treatment – As patients have the right to request treatment, they

           too have the right to refuse treatment such as biological treatment, psychotropic

           medications (Riggins v. Nevada, 1992), and electroconvulsive therapy.

       •   Right to Less Restrictive Treatment – In Dixon v. Weinberger (1975), a U.S.

           District Court ruled that individuals have a right to receive treatment in facilities less

           restrictive than mental institutions. The only patients who can be committed to

           hospitals are those unable to care for themselves.

       •    Right to Live in a Community – The 1974 U.S. District Court case, Staff v. Miller,

            ruled that state mental hospital patients had a right to live in adult homes in their

            communities.



           You should have learned the following in this section:
              •   Patients with a mental illness have a right to treatment, to refuse treatment, to
                  have less restrictive treatment, and to live in a community.



           Section 15.2 Review Questions

              1. What rights do patients with mental illness have and what court cases were
                 pivotal to their establishment?




                             15.3. The Therapist-Client Relationship



Section Learning Objectives

   •   Describe three concerns related to the therapist-client relationship.



Three concerns are of paramount importance in terms of the therapist-client relationship. These

include the following:

       •    Confidentiality – As you might have learned in your introductory psychology course,

            confidentiality guarantees that information about you is not disseminated without

            your consent. This applies to students participating in research studies as well as

            patients seeing a therapist.

                                                15-13
                                                                2nd edition as of August 2020


•   Privileged communication – Confidentiality is an ethical principle while privileged

    communication is a legal one, and states that confidential communications cannot be

    disseminated without the patient’s permission. There are a few exceptions to this

    which include the client being younger than 16, when they are a dependent elderly

    person and a victim of a crime, or when the patient is a danger to him or herself or

    others, to name a few.

•   Duty to Warn – In the 1976 Tarasoff v. the Board of Regents of the University of

    California ruling, the California Supreme Court said that a patient’s right to

    confidentiality ends when there is a danger to the public, and that if a therapist

    determines that such a danger exists, he/she is obligated to warn the potential victim.

    Tatiana Tarasoff, a student at UC, was stabbed to death by graduate student, Prosenjit

    Poddar in 1969, when she rejected his romantic overtures, and despite warnings by

    Poddar’s therapist that he was an imminent threat. The case highlights the fact that

    therapists have a legal and ethical obligation to their clients but, at the same time, a

    legal obligation to society. How exactly should they balance these competing

    obligations, especially when they are vague? The 1980 case of Thompson v. County

    of Alameda ruled that a therapist does not have a duty to warn if the threat is

    nonspecific.

You should have learned the following in this section:
   •   There are three concerns which are important where the therapist-client
       relationship is concerned – confidentiality, privileged communication, and the
       duty to warn.

        Can you play video games so much, that it becomes addictive? Does this
mean that it is a diagnosable mental illness to be listed in the DSM 5? Currently,
the disorder is only listed in the DSM 5 as a condition for further study and has
called it internet gaming disorder. Primarily affecting adolescent males aged
12 to 20, it is thought to include symptoms such as:

   •   Preoccupation or obsession with Internet games
   •   Withdrawal symptoms when not playing Internet games
   •   The person has tried to stop or curb playing Internet games, but has failed
       to do so
   •   A person has had continued overuse of Internet games even with the
       knowledge of how much they impact a person’s life
   •   The person uses Internet games to relieve anxiety or guilt or to escape

Psychology Today writes, “Again, while Internet Gaming Disorder is not an
"official" disorder in the DSM-5, the APA is encouraging further research on the
disorder for possible inclusion in future editions of the DSM.”
(See: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/here-there-and-
everywhere/201407/internet-gaming-disorder-in-dsm-5)

Did the World Health Organization (WHO) already make a decision for
themselves about this? In the draft of ICD 11 the WHO lists the disorder as a
mental health condition and defines it as “a "persistent or recurrent" behavior
pattern of "sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal,
family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of
functioning." For more on this “disorder,” check out the following articles:

Module Recap

       And that’s it. Our final module explored some concepts that transcend any one mental

disorder but affect people with mental illness in general. This included civil and criminal

commitment and issues such as NGRI or the insanity plea, what makes someone dangerous and

what we should do about it, and determining competency to stand trial. We then moved to patient

rights, such as the right to treatment and, conversely, the right to refuse treatment. Finally, we

ended by discussing the patient-therapist relationship and specifically, when the patient’s right to

confidentiality and privileged communication ends, and the therapist has a moral and legal

obligation to warn. We hope you find these topics interesting and explore the issues further

through the links that were provided and peer-reviewed articles that were cited.
