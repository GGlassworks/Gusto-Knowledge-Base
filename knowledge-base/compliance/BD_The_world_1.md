jThis paper would not be possible without the information we received from the regulators and the
representatives of the 103 stock markets that we contacted. We are deeply indebted to them. The first author
is grateful to KAIST, South Korea, for allowing him the use of their Datastream data source when he was

                                                   Abstract



          The existence and the enforcement of insider trading laws in stock markets is a phenomenon of the

1990s. A study of the 103 countries that have stock markets reveals that insider trading laws exist in 87 of

them, but enforcement -- as evidenced by prosecutions -- has taken place in only 38 of them. Before 1990,

the respective numbers were 34 and 9. Does this matter? This is an important question, because though

scores of law, economics and finance papers have argued the pros and cons of insider trading regulations,

no study has yet empirically documented whether prohibitions against insider trading affect the cost of

equity.

          This paper finds that it is the enforcement, not the existence of insider trading laws, that matters.

We find that the cost of equity in a country (after controlling for risk factors, a liquidity factor, and other

shareholder rights) is reduced by about 5% if insider trading laws are enforced.
                                      THE WORLD PRICE OF INSIDER TRADING

           An Insider (Primary or Secondary Insider) may not, by utilizing knowledge of Insider

           Information, acquire or dispose of Insider Securities for his or her own account or for the

           account of another person, or for another person.

                                                                               Section 14 of the WpHG, Germany, 1994

           Laws prohibiting insider trading came late to Germany. They had to come because the European

Union required all its members to implement the European Community Insider Trading Directive

(89/592/EEC of November 13, 1989). The lateness of Germany in establishing laws prohibiting insider

trading, however, was not an exception. Posen (1991) notes that in the beginning of this decade insider

trading was not illegal in most European countries.

           Scores of law, economics and finance papers have argued the pros and cons of insider trading

regulations. Bainbridge (1998), besides providing a list of the 261 papers that have discussed insider trading,

succinctly summarizes the arguments for and against allowing insider trading.1 Manne (1966) provided the

classic argument against the ban on insider trading: a ban would adversely effect market efficiency and it

would impede an effective way to compensate managers. The economic arguments for regulation, besides

disputing Manne’s (1966) assertions, have stated that a ban would reduce adverse selection costs and

increase liquidity, improve confidence in the market, reduce interference in corporate plans, improve

investments and welfare, and motivate large shareholders to monitor management instead of seeking to profit

from inside information. The legal arguments for a ban have been converging to the view that inside

information may be a property of the corporation, and trading on that may be theft. 2

         The debate about insider trading will eventually have to be settled empirically. However, as

Bainbridge (1998) notes, serious empirical research on insider trading is hindered by the subject’s illegality.

The only source of data concerning legal trades are the trading reports filed by corporate insiders, and it is

unlikely that managers will willingly report their violations. Even if they do, it is improbable that managers

are the only insiders. The only source of data concerning illegal trades is confidential, and if any researcher

(for example, Meulbroek (1992)) obtains them, the study will suffer from a selection bias. It should also be

mentioned here that because of availability of data, and because of a long evolution of common law on

insider trading, nearly all empirical research on insider trading has been concentrated in the Unites States3.

Conclusions based on a sample size of one tend not to be robust.

         The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we carry out a comprehensive survey on the existence

and the enforcement (as measured by a prosecution) of insider trading laws around the world. Stamp and

Welsh (1996), in a survey of insider trading laws in a small subset of developed countries, did not like what

they found. We quote them: "in conclusion, it is clear that a number of jurisdictions are either not interested

in, or are not prepared to devote the necessary resources to implementing their insider dealing legislation..."

We update their data set by obtaining information on insider trading laws in every country that has a stock

market. To preclude any selection bias, we begin the second part of the paper only after we have obtained

information from all these countries.

         The second purpose of the paper is to ask whether the existence and enforcement of insider trading

laws matter. To be precise, the research question is whether prohibitions against insider trading affect the

cost of equity. This is an important question because, as a major purpose of stock markets is to facilitate

             John Bagby of Penn State University is developing a bibliography of the law papers on insider trading (see
http://www2.smeal.psu.edu/courses/bagby/it-biblio.html)

         3
             The first prosecution for insider trading occurred in the U.S.A under state law as early as 1903 (Oliver v. Oliver, 45 S.E. 232 Georgia,
1903).


                                                                       -2-
corporations raise financing through equity, corporations would like to know if they have to pay an extra

insider trading premium in stock markets where insiders trade with impunity. If yes, it would be in the

benefit of corporations to have their equity traded in stock markets that limit insider trading.

        These are our findings from our comprehensive survey of stock markets around the world. We find

that at the end of 1998 there were 103 countries that had stock markets. They exhibited a bewildering

diversity. The ages of the stock markets ranged from a few months (1998, Tanzania) to hundreds of years

(1585, Germany). Volume of trade ranged from 0.0003 billion USD (1998, Tanzania) to 5777.6 billion USD

(1997, New York Stock Exchange). The number of listed firms ranged from 2 (1997, Macedonia) to 5843

(1997, India). There was also a wide variation in the existence and enforcement of insider trading laws.

Insider trading laws existed in 87 of them, but enforcement -- as evidenced by prosecutions -- had taken

place in only 38 of them. Before 1990, the respective numbers were 34 and 9. This leads us to conclude that

the existence and the enforcement of insider trading laws in stock markets is a phenomenon of the 1990s.

        Do prohibitions against insider trading affect the cost of equity in a country? As many other things

affect the cost of equity in a country, the most important of which is the risk of the stock market, we can give

a meaningful answer to our question only by controlling for the other determinants of the cost of equity.

This is where we run into a serious problem. There seems to be no consensus in the literature on

international finance as to what variable to use to measure risk.

        The usual proxies for risk have been shown not to perform very well. Though Solnik (1974a,b)

made a strong case for using the world market portfolio as the risk factor, he was soon disillusioned (see

Solnik (1977)). Though Harvey and Zhou (1993) fail to reject the international CAPM, more general models

that allow time-variations (like Harvey (1991)) or multi-factors and time-variations (like Ferson and Harvey

(1993)) are rejected. Though a country’s beta with respect to the world market portfolio has some merit to

explain expected returns for developed countries, it is useless to explain expected returns for emerging

markets; the variance of return of the country’s stock market does better (see Harvey (1995)).


                                                      -3-
        Given this lack of consensus in the literature on international finance as to what variable to use to

measure risk, we adopt an agnostic approach in the paper. This is how we proceed. Our first set of tests

examines the null hypothesis that the existence of insider trading laws do not affect the liquidity of a

country’s stock market. We then check whether enforcement of insider trading laws affects liquidity. Our

results are the following. Both insider trading laws and their enforcement have a positive and significant

effect on liquidity.

        Our second set of tests examines the null hypothesis that the existence of insider trading laws do not

affect the cost of equity in a country’s stock market. We then check whether enforcement of insider trading

laws affects the cost of equity in a country’s stock market. These second set of tests progressively control

for more and more variables.

        The first round of these second set of tests do not control for anything. Our results are the following.

Both insider trading laws and their enforcement have a negative and significant effect on the cost of equity.

        The second round of these second set of tests implicitly control for other factors by using a

forecasted dividend yield plus the growth rate in dividends as a proxy for the cost of equity. Our results are

the following. Both insider trading laws and their enforcement have a negative and significant effect on the

cost of equity.

        The third round of these second set of tests explicitly control for other factors. To control for risk,

we adopt a version of the Bekaert and Harvey (1995) model. This model allows for partial integration of

a country to the world capital markets. Their model is very appealing because it permits a country to evolve

from a developing segmented market (where risk is measured by the country’s variance) to a developed

country which is integrated to world capital markets (where risk is measured by the country’s beta with

respect to the world market portfolio). As Stulz (1999) demonstrates, the gradual integration of a stock

market into the world capital market affects the cost of equity, and models should account for that.

        After removing the effect of the above risk factors, we investigate whether the residuals are affected


                                                      -4-
by the insider trading variables. Our results are the following. Enforcement of insider trading is found to

significantly decrease the cost of equity. On the other hand, the mere existence of insider trading laws has

no effect.

        At this point we investigate whether our finding that the enforcement of insider trading laws

significantly decrease the cost of equity is robust to the inclusion of other factors.

        Dumas and Solnik (1995) show that foreign exchange rate risk is priced. So we investigate whether

the significantly negative effect of the enforcement of insider trading laws remains on the above residuals

after controlling for the foreign exchange rate factor. We find that the negative effect survives.

        As our first set of tests showed that countries that enforce insider trading laws have more liquidity

in their stock markets, and as Brennan and Subrahmanyam (1996) showed that a liquidity premium exists,

it is possible that the above tests are just showing this. So we investigate whether the significantly negative

effect of the enforcement of insider trading laws remains on the above residuals after controlling for the

foreign exchange rate factor and the liquidity factor. We find that the negative effect survives.

        As there has been some recent literature documenting that better legal institutions are associated with

more efficient capital markets -- see, for example, La Porta et al (1996, 1997), Levine (1997), Demirguc-

Kunt and Maksimovic (1998), and Lombardo and Pagano (1999) -- we need to control for these legal factors.

So we investigate whether the significantly negative effect of the enforcement of insider trading laws

remains on the above residuals after controlling for the foreign exchange rate factor, the liquidity factor and

a variable measuring shareholder rights. We find that the negative effect survives.

        Erb, Harvey and Viskanta (1996) found that country credit ratings are a very good proxy for the ex-

ante risk exposure of, particularly, segmented emerging economies. Country credit ratings predict both

expected returns and volatility. They argue that it might be better to use this risk measure that is not

associated with the stock market. So in the third set of tests, we adopt this minimalist approach. This

approach has another advantage: as there are many more countries for which we have data on ratings than


                                                      -5-
countries for which we have data on stock market returns, our sample size is roughly doubled from 51 to 97.

We examine the null hypothesis that the existence of insider trading laws do not affect the credit rating of

a country. We then check whether enforcement of insider trading laws affects the credit rating of country.

Our results are the following. It is found that both insider trading laws and their enforcement lead to a

significant increase in credit ratings.

        To summarize, in the most general formulation of our empirical model, which is the model that

controls for risk factors, a liquidity factor, and a variable that aggregates other shareholder rights, we find

that cost of equity is reduced by roughly 5% on an annual basis if insider trading regulations are enforced.

More importantly, we find that the mere existence of insider trading regulations without their enforcement

does not affect the cost of equity.

        The paper is structured as follows. In Section I we describe our data. Section II gives a descriptive

statistics of our findings from our comprehensive survey of stock markets around the world. Section III,

which is the main section of this paper, tests the null hypothesis that the existence and enforcement of insider

trading laws does not affect the cost of raising equity in a country. We conclude in Section IV.


                                                    I. Data

        We are interested in finding out whether the existence and enforcement of insider trading laws affect

the cost of equity in a country. To this end, we collect primary and secondary data from different sources.

The data could broadly be classified into three categories: the data on the existence and the enforcement of

insider trading in various stock markets of the world, stock market returns, and other variables that may

affect the cost of equity in a country.

A. Data on the Existence and the Enforcement of Insider Trading Laws

        The first thing we did was to count the number of countries that had stock markets. Assuming that




                                                      -6-
every stock market had its own web site in this information age, we counted the number of web sites.4

According to this criterion, there were 103 countries that had stock markets at the end of 1998, of which 23

are classified as developed markets, and 80 are classified as emerging markets. This list included all the 88

countries covered in the 1998 edition of the International Encyclopedia of the Stock Market, and it included

all the 94 countries included in the 1998 edition of the Handbook of World Stock, Derivative and

Commodity Exchanges. The 80 emerging markets we identify include all the 28 emerging markets that

Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) follows as well as the 32 that the International Financial

Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank tracks. The first column in Table I gives a list of all the countries.

           We then sent emails, letters and faxes to all the 103 stock markets, as well as to their national

regulators.5 The reason we sent letters to two sources is because we wanted to cross-check the information

that was provided. We asked in our letter if the stock market had insider trading laws and, if yes, from when.

If they had insider trading laws, we asked if there had been a prosecution under these laws % successful or

unsuccessful % and, if yes, when was the first prosecution. The reason we asked the second question is

because Bhattacharya et al (2000) had shown in the case of one emerging market that the existence of insider

trading laws without their enforcement % as proxied by a prosecution % does not deter insiders. Wherever

possible, and this was only possible for a small subset of developed countries, the answers were cross-

checked against the findings of Posen (1991) and Stamp and Welsh (1996).

           As we were acutely sensitive of the fact that responses were likely from countries that had enforced

insider trading laws, which would lead to a severe selection bias in our results, we began our formal tests

only after we had obtained information from all the 103 countries. This took about a year, and as many as

           The Yahoo website (http://dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Finance_and_Investment/Exchanges/Stock_Exchanges) gives a

            The email and postal addresses of the stock markets, as well as their facsimile numbers, were obtained from their respective web sites.
The email and postal addresses of the national regulators, as well as their facsimile numbers, were obtained from the membershi p list of the
International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) (http://www.iosco.org/iosco.html). Some countries did not have national regulators.

5 reminders to certain stock markets. The second column in Table I tells us that this information was

available for all 103 countries.

B. Stock Market Returns

           Data on monthly equity indices were obtained from Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI).

MSCI covers only 23 developed countries and 28 emerging markets. All our data extend to December 1998.

For the developed countries the data begin on January 1969, but there are exceptions. For the emerging

markets the data begin on January 1988, but there are exceptions. The third column in Table I gives us the

sample period that was available for these 51 monthly stock market indices. These indices are value-

weighted, and are calculated with dividend reimbursement. As noted by Harvey (1991), the returns

computed on the basis of these indices are highly correlated with popular country indices. The MSCI value-

weighted World Index was used as a proxy for the market portfolio. 6

           We also obtained data on monthly equity indices of emerging markets from the International

Financial Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank. They cover a slightly different set of emerging markets and

their data begin from different dates for different markets.7 The selection criteria for including stocks in the

two indices are different. 8 This leads us to make a difficult choice. If we use the MSCI data for emerging

markets, it has the advantage that we are consistent in our methodology of constructing indices for all

countries, but it has the disadvantage that we do not have as much data for the emerging markets that the IFC




           6
             The MSCI World Index is actually an index of only developed countries. It begins in December 1969. In principle, we should have
used the MSCI All Country World Index, but since this begins only from December 1987 and has a correlation of 0.996767 with the developed
country index, it is better to use the developed country index in practice. The results in this paper are with respect to this developed country index.
We ran all our tests using the AC World Index as well. As all the results are similar, we do not report it in this paper.

           7
             IFC covers 32 emerging markets. The data begins from January 1976 for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Greece, India, Korea, Mexico,
Thailand and Zimbabwe; it begins from January 1979 for Jordan; it begins from January 1985 for Colombia, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan,
Philippines, Taiwan and Venezuela; it begins from January 1986 for Portugal and Turkey; it begins from January 1990 for Indonesia; it begins from
January 1993 for China, Hungary, Peru, Poland and South Africa; it begins from January 1994 for the Czech Republic, it begins from January 1996
for Egypt, Morocco, Russia and Slovakia; it begins from January 1997 for Israel; and it begins from January 1998 for Saudi Arabia.

           8
            Although both MSCI and IFC try to represent 60 percent of total market capitalization, MSCI designs its indices to mirror the industrial
composition of the local market, whereas IFC tends to choose the more liquid stocks.


                                                                         -8-
database has. If, instead, we choose the IFC data for emerging markets, it has the disadvantage that we are

inconsistent in our methodology of constructing indices across the two sub samples, but it has the advantage

of more data for the emerging markets. Given that we find that insider trading laws were rarely enforced

before the 1990s, which implies that the pre-1990 IFC data does not have much cross-sectional variation with

respect to this crucial variable, we decided that the first choice was better. So we report all our results using

only the MSCI database.9

           Descriptive statistics about the stock markets for 1997 were obtained from the 1998 edition of the

Handbook of World Stock, Derivative and Commodity Exchanges. We obtained the following information

about 94 countries: the year of establishment, the number of firms listed at year-end 1997, the market

capitalization in USD at year-end 1997, and the volume of trade in USD in 1997. Data on the missing 9

countries as well as cross-checks of the above data were obtained from the 103 stock market web sites.

C. Other variables that may affect the cost of equity in a country

           Liquidity, as demonstrated by Brennan and Subrahmanyam (1996), may affect the cost of equity.

The measure of liquidity that we adopted was turnover, and this is defined as the volume of trade in the stock

market divided by the market capitalization of the stock market. We obtained monthly data on the volume

of trade and market capitalization for the 51 countries (23 developed countries plus 28 emerging economies)

from the vendor Datastream. The data begin in 1973. For some countries the data began later. The fourth

and fifth column in Table I gives us the sample period that was available for these 51 monthly market

capitalization and volume time-series.

           A quick and dirty measure of the cost of equity is forecasted dividend yield plus growth rate in

dividends. We obtained monthly data on the dividend yield for the 51 countries from the vendor Datastream.

We multiplied market capitalization by the dividend yield to obtain the dividend level, and from this we



           9
            We ran all our tests using the IFC database as well. As all the results are similar, we do not report it in this paper. The interested reader
may obtain these results from the authors.


                                                                          -9-
computed the dividend growth. The data begin in 1973. For some countries the data began later. The sixth

column in Table I gives us the sample period that was available for these 51 monthly dividend yield time-

series.

          Bekaert and Harvey (1997) divide the sum of exports and imports with a country’s gross domestic

product to obtain a variable that proxies the level of integration of a country with the rest of the world. This

is because the level of globalization does affect the cost of equity (see Stulz (1999)).

We use the same method. Monthly data on exports and imports for the 51 countries were obtained from the

vendor Datastream, as were quarterly data on gross domestic product. We divided GDP by 3 to obtain

monthly GDP. The data begin in 1969. For some countries the data began later, and for some countries the

frequency of GDP was yearly. In the latter case, we divided by 12 to obtain monthly GDP. The seventh,

eighth and ninth column in Table I gives us the sample period that was available for these 51 GDP, exports

and imports time-series.

          Dumas and Solnik (1995) show that foreign exchange rate risk is priced. Monthly data on foreign

exchange rates is obtained from the vendor Datastream. The data begin in 1986. For some countries the data

began later. The tenth column in Table I gives us the sample period that was available for these 51 monthly

foreign exchange rate time-series.

          The data on legal variables were obtained from La Porta et al (1996). We were specifically

interested in a variable that measures shareholder rights. We constructed an index aggregating shareholder

rights from their Table 2. The index is formed by adding 1 when: (1) there is one share-one vote rule; (2)

the country allows shareholders to mail their proxy vote to the firm; (3) shareholders are not required to

deposit their shares prior to the General Shareholders' Meeting; (4) cumulative voting or proportional

representation of minorities in the board of directors is allowed; (5) an oppressed minorities mechanism is

in place; and (6) the minimum percentage of share capital that entitles a shareholder to call for an

Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting is less than or equal to 10 percent (the sample median). The index


                                                     -10-
ranges from 0 to 6. The eleventh column in Table I gives us this computed index value for the 49 countries

they track.

        Erb, Harvey and Viskanta (1996) found that country credit ratings are a very good proxy for the ex-

ante risk exposure of, particularly, segmented emerging economies. Country credit ratings come from

Institutional Investor’s semi-annual survey of bankers. The survey represents the responses of 75-100

bankers. Respondents rate each country on a scale of 0 to 100. They rate them once every six months. The

data, with a few exceptions, begins on September 1979 and ends on September 1999. This data can be

download from Harvey’s web site (http://www.duke.edu/~charvey). The twelfth column in Table I gives

us the sample period that was available for these 97 biannual country credit ratings time-series.

        Table II gives descriptive statistics of the main stock markets in the 103 countries that have stock

markets. They exhibit a bewildering diversity.

        The ages of the stock markets range from a few months (1998, Tanzania) to hundreds of years (1585,

Germany), with the median year of establishment being 1953. As expected, stock markets in the developed

countries (median year of establishment is 1845) are older than stock markets in the emerging markets

(median year of establishment is 1974). The number of listed firms ranged from 2 (1997, Macedonia) to

5843 (1997, India), with the median number of listed firms being 128. As expected, stock markets in the

developed countries (median number of listed firms is 237) list more firms than stock markets in the

emerging economies (median number of listed firms is 84). Market capitalization of the stock markets

ranged from 0.002 billion USD (1997, Guatemala) to 8879.631 billion USD (1997, New York Stock

Exchange), with the median being 14.8 billion USD. As expected, the size of the stock markets in the

developed countries (median size is 290.383 billion USD) is bigger than the size of the stock markets in the



                                                   -11-
emerging economies (median size is 3.67 billion USD). Volume of trade ranged from 0.0003 billion USD

(1998, Tanzania) to 5777.6 billion USD (1997, New York Stock Exchange), with the median volume being

4.92 billion USD. As expected, there is more trade in the stock markets of the developed countries (median

volume is 164.6 billion USD) than in the stock markets of the emerging economies (median volume is 0.639

billion USD). Turnover, which is defined as, volume divided by market capitalization, ranged from 0.00127

(1998, Tanzania) to 30.99 (1997, Ecuador), with the median being 0.338. As expected, the liquidity of the

stock markets in the developed countries (median turnover is 0.547) is bigger than the liquidity of the stock

markets in the emerging economies (median turnover is 0.246).

        The next few columns in Table II gives us the performance of stock market returns in the 51

countries (23 developed and 28 emerging) that we have data from MSCI. As this data covers the last three

decades for developed countries and only the last decade for emerging economies, comparisons between the

two sub samples may be misleading. Two stylized facts, however, remain true: one, emerging markets

(median annualized standard deviation of returns is 38%) have more volatile returns than developed

countries (median annualized standard deviation of returns is 22%); and, two, there is a lot more variation

in the performance amongst emerging economies (annualized arithmetic mean returns range from -18.2%

to 28.1%) than there is in the performance amongst developed countries (annualized arithmetic mean returns

range from 3.2% to 16.9%). This last fact is very helpful for our tests, because as we will see later, there is

a lot more variation in existence and enforcement of insider trading laws amongst emerging economies than

there is amongst developed countries.

B. The existence and enforcement of insider trading laws around the world

        The last two columns in Table II give us information on the existence and enforcement of insider

trading laws for every country that has a stock market. Insider trading laws were first established in the

United States (1934). Till 1967, when France established these laws, the US was the only country that had

insider trading laws. The latest country to establish insider trading laws is Cyprus (1999). The median year


                                                     -12-
of establishment of these laws is 1991. Developed countries (median year of establishment of insider trading

laws is 1989) have had these laws in their books longer than emerging markets (median year of establishment

of insider trading laws is 1992). Today, 100% of developed countries have insider trading laws on their

books, but only 80% of emerging markets do. Before 1990, the respective numbers were 56.5% and 37.5%.

           The enforcement of insider trading laws is difficult to measure. If we assume that a law is not

enforced unless a charge is brought under it, a reasonable way to measure enforcement is to date the first

prosecution, and assume that enforcement begins after that date. This is what we did. We found that the first

case under federal insider trading laws took place in the United States (1961).10 Till 1990, only 9 countries

had brought any charges under these laws. The latest country to prosecute under insider trading laws is

Oman. The median year of the first prosecution is 1994. Though the median year for the first prosecution

was the same for both developed countries and emerging economies, 78.3% of developed countries have

prosecuted till today, but only 24.1% of emerging markets have prosecuted till today. Before 1990, the

respective numbers were 21.7% and 7%.

           Figure 1 graphically demonstrates the history of the existence and the enforcement of insider trading

laws in the twentieth century. It plots the time series of the number of countries with stock markets, the

number of countries that have insider trading laws, and the number of countries that enforce their insider

trading laws. It is apparent from this graph that in the first third of this century, these laws did not exist

anywhere; in the second third of this century, these laws existed in only one country (the United States); and

in the last third of this century, existence and enforcement of insider trading laws accelerated. This

acceleration was particularly pronounced in the 1990s.

           Figure 1 also tells us that if we use the argument of revealed preferences of governments around the



           10
              In 1961,the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Unites States had an enforcement action against Cady, Roberts and Company.
The case involved tipping: an insider (the tipper), who does not trade, discloses information to an outsider (the tippee), who trades. The classic
insider trading case, which set precedents for the common law in the US, was Texas Gulf Sulpur (1968). See Bainbridge (1998) for a lucid
description on the evolution of common law on insider trading in the United States.


                                                                      -13-
world, it seems that a consensus has been achieved amongst governments: insider trading laws are good for

society. So the debate about the pros and cons of insider trading laws seems to have been settled. Every

developed country today has these insider trading laws, and four out of five emerging market economies

have it.

           The enforcement of these laws, however, is a different issue. Only one in three countries have

enforced these laws.        Why?     We quote Stamp and Welsh here: "...In a number of common law

jurisdictions.....the burden of proof on the prosecution is onerous, making it difficult to secure a conviction.

In other jurisdictions, this problem is exacerbated by the legislatures’ attempt to provide an exhaustive list

...which can be exploited by the experienced insider dealer. On the other hand, in a number of other

countries, ...there is no political will to enforce the legislation."

           Do the existence and the enforcement of insider trading laws in stock markets affect the cost of

equity? We attempt to answer this question in the next section.


                                III. In Search of an Insider Trading Premium

           We use two variables related to insider trading regulation. The first one is related to the existence

of laws prohibiting insider trading in the country of interest ("IT laws"). The second variable relates to legal

prosecution for insider trading in the country of interest ("IT enforcement"). These insider trading variables

are coded as follows. The indicator variable "IT laws" changes from 0 to 1 in the year after the insider

trading laws are instituted. The indicator variable "IT enforcement" changes from 0 to 1 in the year after the

first prosecution is recorded.

A. Effect on liquidity

           Does the existence of insider trading laws and their enforcement increase the willingness of investors

to trade in financial markets? We can answer this question by examining the effect of our two insider trading

variables on a measure of market liquidity. We use the natural logarithm of the ratio of volume to market



                                                       -14-
capitalization as a measure of liquidity. Call this variable "liq". We then run simple pooled regressions of

our measure of liquidity on our insider trading variables. The regressions use data from our 51 countries from

December 1969 to December 1998 (some countries do not have data for the full time period).

        Table III presents the results from this pooled regression. When "IT laws" is the independent

variable and "liq" is the dependent variable, Panel A tells us that the coefficient on "IT laws" is positive and

statistically significant at the 5% level. When "IT enforcement" is the independent variable and "liq" is the

dependent variable, Panel B tells us that the coefficient on "IT enforcement" is positive and statistically

significant at the 5% level. These results provide evidence in favor of a testable implication drawn from the

theoretical model of Bhattacharya and Spiegel (1991): insider trading laws and their enforcement improve

liquidity in a market. Judging by p-values, the effect of enforcement of insider trading laws on liquidity

seems to be stronger than the effect of their mere existence.

B. Effect on cost of equity

B.1. Unadjusted cost of equity

        The proxy we use for cost of equity (the expected rate of equity return) is the realized rate of equity

return. We call this variable "rawret". We then run simple pooled regressions of our measure of the cost

of equity on our insider trading variables. The regressions use data from our 51 countries from December

1969 to December 1998 (some countries do not have data for the full time period).

        Table IV presents the results from this pooled regression. When "IT laws" is the independent

variable and "rawret" is the dependent variable, Panel A tells us that the coefficient on "IT laws" is negative

and statistically significant at the 10% level. When "IT enforcement" is the independent variable and

"rawret" is the dependent variable, Panel B tells us that the coefficient on "IT enforcement" is negative and

statistically significant at the 6% level.

B.2. Implicitly-adjusted cost of equity

        The second proxy for cost of capital is computed as the sum of the forecast of the dividend yield and

                                                     -15-
the growth rate of the dividend yield. This is a quick and dirty method to compute the cost of capital by

backing it out from the classical constant growth dividend discount model. As risk affects the price, which

is the denominator in the dividend yield, this method implicitly accounts for risk. We call this variable

"div". We then run simple pooled regressions of our measure of the cost of equity on our insider trading

variables. The regressions use data from our 51 countries from December 1969 to December 1998 (some

countries do not have data for the full time period).

        Table V presents the results from this pooled regression. When "IT laws" is the independent variable

and "div" is the dependent variable, Panel A tells us that the coefficient on "IT laws" is negative and

statistically significant at the 5% level. When "IT enforcement" is the independent variable and "div" is the

dependent variable, Panel B tells us that the coefficient on "IT enforcement" is negative and statistically

significant at the 2% level.

B.3. Explicitly-adjusted cost of equity

        The major determining feature of the cost of equity is risk. We, therefore, need to control for risk

in order to measure the marginal impact of insider trading laws. As there is no consensus in the international

finance literature as to how to measure risk, we approach this problem by first discussing what elements we

must include in our model.

        The first thing we need to include is conditional covariances and conditional variances instead of

unconditional covariances and unconditional variances. This is because Ferson and Harvey (1993) make a

point that conditional betas explain some risk-premium in developed capital markets. We obtain conditional

covariances and conditional variances from a multivariate ARCH model. This model was first introduced

by Bollerslev, Engle and Wooldrige (1988). The specification we use can be written as follows:




                                                    -16-

where

ri, t is the monthly return of the stock market index of country i at time t,

        As in Engle, Lilien, and Robin (1987), the weights of the lagged residual vectors are taken to be 1/2,

1/3, and 1/6, respectively. Maximum likelihood is used to estimate the above model.



                                                               -17-
        The second thing we need to include is time-varying market integration. Stulz (1999) provided a

theoretical argument to show that in a perfectly integrated world, the relevant measure for risk of a country’s

returns is the covariance between this country’s returns and the world market portfolio’s returns, whereas,

in a perfectly segmented world, the relevant measure of risk is the volatility of the country’s returns. In

reality, national financial markets are not completely integrated, nor completely segmented. Moreover, the

degree of integration/segmentation is not likely to be fixed over time. The model we use is very similar to

the one presented by Bekaert and Harvey (1995). We simplify their model by assuming that the size of the

trade sector -- imports plus exports divided by gross domestic product -- is the only instrument for market

integration. This variable is used in a logistic function, which assigns time-varying weights to world versus

local risk factors. Bekeart and Harvey (1997) find that increases in this ratio are associated with increased

importance of world relative to local risk factors.

        The model we use can be expressed as follows:


         (ri,t − rf ,t ) = α0 + φi,t λcov cov t [ri ,t , rw ,t ] + (1 − φi,t )λvar vart [ri,t ] + ei,t      (2)

                                          gdp t        
where            φi , t =                                                                                   (3)
                                     exp ortst + importst 
                            1 + expα1                     
                                             gdp t        




and rf, t is the monthly return of the 3 month US T-Bill at time t.

        Here 8cov is the price of the covariance risk with the world, and 8var is the price of own country

variance risk. These have to be estimated. The conditional covariances and variances, Cov t [ri, t , rw, t ] and


                                                         -18-
Var t [ri, t ] respectively, are obtained from the multivariate ARCH model described above. Ni , t measures the

level of integration of country i at time t. The definition of Ni , t implies that it is a ratio of the sum of exports

and imports to gross domestic product. It is designed to take values between zero and one. It determines the

exposure of the countries equity to global risk (covariance) versus local risk (variance). The model is

estimated using non-linear least squares. The results are given in Panel A of Table VI.

          Panel A in Table VI tells us that 8cov is statistically insignificant, implying that the covariance risk

is not priced. Panel A in Table VI also tells us that 8var is positive and statistically significant, implying that

own country variance risk is priced.

B.3.1 Adjusting for risk

          If the insider trading variables have no incremental effect on the cost of equity, then those variables

will be orthogonal to the residuals from the model in (2). We therefore test the hypothesis that the insider

trading variables do not affect the cost of equity by regressing the residuals from model (2) on the insider

trading variables 11. The results from this test is given in Panel B of Table VI.

          Panel B in Table VI tells us that the coefficient on "IT laws" is statistically insignificant. On the

other hand, Panel B in Table VI tells us that the "IT enforcement" dummy has a negative effect on the cost

of equity. It is significant at the 8% significance level.

          We conclude, therefore, that the mere existence of insider trading laws do not affect the cost of

equity. The enforcement of insider trading laws, on the other hand, reduces the cost of equity.

          At this point we investigate whether our finding -- the enforcement of insider trading laws

significantly decreases the cost of equity % is robust to the inclusion of other factors.

B.3.2 Adjusting for risk and a foreign exchange factor


          11
             We do not include the insider trading variables in the model in (2) directly for the following reason. The insider trading
variables are dummy variables that take on the value of zero or one. Including a dummy variable in a non-linear estimation is subject
to computational problems as the convergence of the optimization becomes more difficult and the results more unstable. This is
especially the case for our model, which is large and complex. In any case, it should be noted that the two approaches are similar and
should yield the same outcome for the test.

                                                                -19-
        Dumas and Solnik (1995) show that foreign exchange rate risk is priced. So we investigate whether

the significantly negative effect of the enforcement of insider trading laws remains on the above residuals

after controlling for the foreign exchange rate factor.

        The foreign exchange factor that we use is the conditional covariance of the return of the stock

market index of the country with the return a US investor would get if she held the foreign currency. Denote

this covariance as Cov t [ri,t,rifx,t ]. This conditional covariance is obtained by using the multi variate ARCH

model we previously discussed.% just replace the world portfolio (w) by the foreign exchange portfolio (ifx)

        Panel B1 of Table VII is just panel B of Table VI, which were the results that were obtained if we

regress the residuals from model (2) against only the insider trading enforcement variable. We now regress

the residuals from model (2) against the insider trading enforcement variable as well as the above foreign

exchange factor. Panel B2 of Table VII tells us that the coefficient on the insider trading enforcement

variable factor continues to remain negative and significant at the 5% level.

B.3.3 Adjusting for risk, a foreign exchange factor, and a liquidity factor

         Brennan and Subrahmanyam (1996) showed that a liquidity premium exists. Investors require a

premium to compensate them for holding relatively illiquid assets. As our first set of tests showed that

countries that enforce insider trading laws have more liquidity in their stock markets, it is possible that

enforcement of insider trading laws is reducing the equity premium because the liquidity premium is being

reduced. We need to control for this.

        The liquidity variable is constructed as the natural logarithm of the ratio of volume to market

capitalization. We regress the residuals from model (2) against the insider trading enforcement variable, the

foreign exchange factor, and the liquidity factor. Panel B3 of Table VII tells us that the coefficient on the

insider trading enforcement variable factor continues to remain negative and significant at the 10% level.

B.3.4 Adjusting for risk, a foreign exchange factor, a liquidity factor, and shareholder rights

        As there has been some recent literature documenting that better legal institutions are associated with


                                                     -20-
more efficient capital markets -- see, for example, La Porta et al (1996, 1997), Levine (1997), Demirguc-

Kunt and Maksimovic (1998), and Lombardo and Pagano (1999) -- we need to control for these other legal

factors.12

         We computed an index measuring shareholder rights by adding 1 when: (1) there is one share-one

vote; (2) the country allows shareholders to mail their proxy vote to the firm; (3) shareholders are not

required to deposit their shares prior to the General Shareholders’ Meeting; (4) cumulative voting or

proportional representation of minorities in the board of directors is allowed; (5) an oppressed minorities

mechanism is in place; and (6) the minimum percentage of share capital that entitles a shareholder to call

for an Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting is less than or equal to 10 percent (the sample median). The

index ranges from 0 to 6. This data is obtained from Table 2 in La Porta et al (1996).

         We regress the residuals from model (2) against the insider trading enforcement variable, the foreign

exchange factor, the liquidity factor, and this index measuring shareholder rights. Panel B4 of Table VII tells

us that the coefficient on the insider trading enforcement variable factor continues to remain negative and

significant at the 6% level. It is interesting to note that in this most generalized test of our model, the other

variables seem to have no explanatory power. Though we would not like to overemphasize this finding, it

seems that, other than own country variance, the enforcement of insider trading laws is the most important

determinant of the cost of equity in a country’s stock market.

         If we annualize the coefficient on the insider trading enforcement variable factor (-.00461), we find

that the enforcement of insider trading reduces cost of equity by about 5% per year. This might appear to

be unrealistically large. However, we need to keep in mind that the majority of the countries in our sample

are emerging markets, and these have yearly returns ranging from -18.2% to 28.1%. With this respect, our

estimate of the impact of enforcing insider trading laws on the cost of equity does not seem extreme.




         12
              Lombardo and Pagano (1999) show that these legal variables are correlated with the return on equity.


                                                                     -21-
C. Effect on Country Rating

            Erb, Harvey and Viskanta (1996) found that country credit ratings are a very good proxy for the ex-

ante risk exposure of, particularly, segmented emerging economies. Country credit ratings predict both

expected returns and volatility. They argue that it might be better to use this risk measure that is not

associated with the stock market. So in the third set of tests, we adopt this minimalist approach. This

approach has another advantage: as there are many more countries for which we have data on ratings than

countries for which we have data on stock market returns, our sample size is roughly doubled from 51 to 97.

We call this country credit rating variable as "cr".

            We examine the null hypothesis that the existence of insider trading laws do not affect the cost of

equity of a country as proxied by its credit rating. We then check whether enforcement of insider trading

laws makes any difference. Table VIII presents the results from this pooled regression. When "IT laws" is

the independent variable and "cr" is the dependent variable, Panel A tells us that the coefficient on "IT laws"

is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level. When "IT enforcement" is the independent variable

and "cr" is the dependent variable, Panel B tells us that the coefficient on "IT enforcement" is positive and

statistically significant at the 5% level. So both existence and enforcement of insider trading laws are

significantly positively correlated with a country’s credit rating.

            Panel B of Table VIII tells us that the enforcement of insider trading laws increases a country’s

credit rating by 27 points. According to the estimated logarithmic empirical model of Erb, Harvey and

Viskanta (1996) 13, a jump of a country’s credit rating from 70 to 100 decreases its annualized cost of capital

by about 7%, and a jump of a country’s credit rating from 60 to 90 decreases its annualized cost of capital

by about 8%. Given these numbers, our finding in Table VII that annualized cost of capital decreases by 5%

if insider trading laws are enforced looks reasonable.



            13
                  The estimated logarithmic model of Erb, Harvey and Viskanta (1996) is Bi-annual Cost of Capital = 52.32% - 10.14% (ln of country
credit rating).

                                         IV. Concluding Remarks

        Though the debate about the pros and cons of allowing insider trading in stock markets has been

quite contentious in the law, economics and finance literature, it seems that from the point of view of actual

practice, the debate seems to have been settled. In a comprehensive survey of insider trading regulations in

every country that had a stock market at the end of 1998, this paper finds that 100% of the 23 developed

countries, and about 80% of the 80 emerging markets, had insider trading laws in their books.

        The enforcement of these laws, however, has been spotty. We find that there has been a prosecution

in only one out of three countries. Developed countries have a better record than emerging markets (78.3%

of developed countries, and 23.1% of emerging markets have had prosecutions).

        The paper then goes on to show that the easy part % the establishment of insider trading laws % does

not seem to reduce the cost of equity. It is the difficult part % the enforcement of insider trading laws % that

actually reduces the cost of equity in a country. As a matter of fact, controlling for risk factors, a liquidity

factor, and other possible legal determinants of the cost of equity, the paper finds that the enforcement of

insider trading laws reduces the cost of equity by 5%.

        Lombardo and Pagano (1999) argue that in an imperfectly integrated world, the supply of funds is

upward sloping rather than perfectly horizontal. As legal variables affect both the supply as well as the

demand for funds, the relationship between legal variables and the cost of funds could go either way. In

particular, the improvement of the legal system in a country may increase the firm’s demand for funds and

thus increase its equilibrium price, or it may increase the supply of funds by households and thus decrease

its equilibrium price. In their paper, they find that the relationship between legal variables and the cost of

equity is mostly positive, and they correctly interpret this to mean that the demand side is affected more than

the supply side.

        In our paper, we find the relationship between cost of equity and the enforcement of insider trading

laws to be negative. This means that the supply side is more affected than the demand side. This is to be

                                                     -23-
expected because theory suggests that less adverse selection would encourage investors to demand a lower

insider trading premium, but should not per se encourage firms to supply more equity.

        We leave future research to check the robustness of our results. First, once we have more stock

market return data of many more countries, it can be checked whether our results still remain valid. Second,

we need to use different models to measure risk. The literature on measuring risk in international markets

is a growing field, and the particular model of Bekaert and Harvey (1995) that we have employed in this

paper is just one of many worthwhile candidates.

Notes:

(1) Stock markets of 103 countries had web sites. We assumed this to be the universe of all countries that had stock markets. The list is given in Column 1.
(2) We sent letters to the regulators and the stock markets in the 103 countries that had stock markets, asking them about their insider trading laws. Column 2 tells us that we received information from all of them.
(3) Data on monthly stock market indices were obtained from Morgan Stanley Capital Market International (MSCI). They were available for 23 developed countries and for 28 emerging markets. The sample periods are given in Column 3.
(4) Data on monthly market capitalization and volume were obtained from Datastream. The sample periods are given in Columns 4 and 5.
(5) Data on monthly dividend yields were obtained from Datastream. The sample periods are given in Column 6.
(6) Data on quarterly/annual GDP and monthly exports and imports were obtained from Datastream. The sample periods are given in Columns 7, 8 and 9.
(7) Data on monthly foreign exchange rates were obtained from Datastream. The sample periods are given in Column 10.
(8) Data on the index measuring shareholder rights is obtained by adding 1 when: (1) there is one share-one vote rule; (2) the country allows shareholders to mail their proxy vote to the firm; (3) shareholders are not required to deposit their shares prior to the General Shareholders'
Meeting; (4) cumulative voting or proportional representation of minorities in the board of directors is allowed; (5) an oppressed minorities mechanism is in place; and (6) the minimum percentage of share capital that entitles a shareholder to call for an Extraordinary
Shareholders' Meeting is less than or equal to 10 percent (the sample median). The index ranges from 0 to 6. This data is obtained from Table 2 in La Porta et al (1996). Column 11 gives us this computed index.
(9) Data on bi-annual country credit ratings is obtained from the website of Harvey (http://www.duke.edu/~charvey). The sample periods are given in Column 12.

The estimation is based on monthly data from 1969:12-1998:12. Excess returns are computed as continuously
compounded returns minus the 3-month treasury bill rate.The insider trading variables were coded as follows. The
indicator variable "IT laws" for existence changed from 0 to 1 in the year after the insider trading laws were
instituted. The indicator variable "IT enforcement" for enforcement changed from 0 to 1 in the year after the first
prosecution was recorded.The equity data are from Morgan Stanley Capital International. p-values in brackets were
computed using the procedures suggested by Newey and West (1987). The model used is as follows:

Effect of Insider Trading Enforcement on the Cost of Equity (Explicitly Adjusted for Risk, Foreign
                     Exchange Risk, Liquidity and Other Shareholder Rights)

The estimation is based on monthly data from 1969:12-1998:12. Excess returns are computed as continuously
compounded returns minus the 3-month treasury bill rate.The insider trading variables were coded as follows. The
indicator variable "IT laws" for existence changed from 0 to 1 in the year after the insider trading laws were
instituted. The indicator variable "IT enforcement" for enforcement changed from 0 to 1 in the year after the first
prosecution was recorded.The equity data are from Morgan Stanley Capital International. p-values in brackets were
computed using the procedures suggested by Newey and West (1987). The model used is as follows:


                           (ri,t − rf ,t ) = α0 + φi,t λcov covt [ri ,t , rw,t ] + (1 − φi,t )λvar vart [ri,t ] + ei,t

Here "exports", "imports" and "gdp" are exports, imports and gdp respectively for the country of interest. 8cov is the
price of the covariance risk with the world, and 8var is the price of own country variance risk. The conditional
covariances and variances, Cov t [ri, t , rw, t ] and Var t [ri, t ] respectively, are obtained from the multivariate ARCH

                                        Effect on Country Rating

The pooled regressions are based on bi-annual data from 1979:2-1998:2. The dependent variable is "cr",

which represents a country credit rating. They come from Institutional Investor’s semi-annual survey of

bankers. The survey represents the responses of 75-100 bankers. Respondents rate each country on a scale

of 0 to 100. The independent variables are the insider trading variables, which are coded as follows. The

indicator variable "IT laws" for existence changed from 0 to 1 in the year after the insider trading laws were

instituted. The indicator variable "IT enforcement" for enforcement changed from 0 to 1 in the year after

the first prosecution was recorded. p-values in brackets were computed using the procedures suggested by

Newey and West (1987).
