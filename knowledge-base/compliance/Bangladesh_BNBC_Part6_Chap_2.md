Chapter 2
             LOADS ON BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES

2.1      INTRODUCTION
2.1.1    Scope

This Chapter specifies the minimum design forces including dead load, live load, wind and earthquake loads,
miscellaneous loads and their various combinations. These loads shall be applicable for the design of buildings
and structures in conformance with the general design requirements provided in Chapter 1.

2.1.2    Limitations

Provisions of this Chapter shall generally be applied to majority of buildings and other structures covered in this
Code subject to normally expected loading conditions. For those buildings and structures having unusual
geometrical shapes, response characteristics or site locations, or for those subject to special loading including
tornadoes, special dynamic or hydrodynamic loads etc., site‐specific or case‐specific data or analysis may be
required to determine the design loads on them. In such cases, and all other cases for which loads are not
specified in this Chapter, loading information may be obtained from reliable references or specialist advice may
be sought. However, such loads shall be applied in compliance with the provisions of other Parts or Sections of
this Code.

LITERATURE
RESISTANCE FACTOR A factor that accounts for unavoidable deviations of the actual strength from the
                   nominal value and the manner and consequences of failure. This is also known as
                   strength reduction factor.
RESPONSE                   It is the factor by which the actual base shear force that would develop if the structure
REDUCTION FACTOR           behaved truly elastic during earthquake, is reduced to obtain design base shear. This
                           reduction is allowed to account for the beneficial effects of inelastic deformation
                           (resulting in energy dissipation) that can occur in a structure during a major earthquake,
                           still ensuring acceptable response of the structure.

CATEGORY                   the design earthquake ground motion at the site.
SEISMIC‐FORCE‐             That part of the structural system that has been considered in the design to provide the
RESISTING SYSTEM           required resistance to the seismic forces.
SHEAR WALL                 A wall designed to resist lateral forces acting in its plane (sometimes referred to as a
                           vertical diaphragm or a structural wall).

         weight of all materials of construction incorporated into the building to be supported permanently by
          the member,

         weight of permanent partitions,

         weight of fixed service equipment, and

2.2.5       Weight of Permanent Partitions

When partition walls are indicated on the plans, their weight shall be considered as dead load acting as
concentrated line loads in their actual positions on the floor. The loads due to anticipated partition walls, which
are not indicated on the plans, shall be treated as live loads and determined in accordance with Sec 2.3.6.

2.2.6    Weight of Fixed Service Equipment

Weights of fixed service equipment and other permanent machinery, such as electrical feeders and other
machinery, heating, ventilating and air‐conditioning systems, lifts and escalators, plumbing stacks and risers etc.
shall be included as dead load whenever such equipment are supported by structural members.

2.2.7    Additional Loads

In evaluating the final dead loads on a structural member for design purposes, allowances shall be made for
additional loads resulting from the (i) difference between the prescribed and the actual weights of the members
and construction materials; (ii) inclusion of future installations; (iii) changes in occupancy or use of buildings;
and (iv) inclusion of structural and non‐structural members not covered in Sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3.


2.3      LIVE LOADS
2.3.1    General

The live loads used for the structural design of floors, roof and the supporting members shall be the greatest
applied loads arising from the intended use or occupancy of the building, or from the stacking of materials and
the use of equipment and propping during construction, but shall not be less than the minimum design live
loads set out by the provisions of this Section. For the design of structural members for forces including live
loads, requirements of the relevant Sections of Chapter 1 shall also be fulfilled.

2.3.2    Definition

Live load is the load superimposed by the use or occupancy of the building not including the environmental
loads such as wind load, rain load, earthquake load or dead load.

2.3.3    Minimum Floor Live Loads

The minimum floor live loads shall be the greatest actual imposed loads resulting from the intended use or
occupancy of the floor, and shall not be less than the uniformly distributed load patterns specified in Sec 2.3.4
or the concentrated loads specified in Sec 2.3.5 whichever produces the most critical effect. The live loads shall
be assumed to act vertically upon the area projected on a horizontal plane.

2.3.4    Uniformly Distributed Loads

The uniformly distributed live load shall not be less than the values listed in Table 6.2.3, reduced as may be
specified in Sec 2.3.13, applied uniformly over the entire area of the floor, or any portion thereof to produce the
most adverse effects in the member concerned.

2.3.5    Concentrated Loads

The concentrated load to be applied non‐concurrently with the uniformly distributed load given in Sec 2.3.4,
shall not be less than that listed in Table 6.2.3. Unless otherwise specified in Table 6.2.3 or in the following
paragraph, the concentrated load shall be applied over an area of 300 mm x 300 mm and shall be located so as
to produce the maximum stress conditions in the structural members.

In areas where vehicles are used or stored, such as car parking garages, ramps, repair shops etc., provision shall
be made for concentrated loads consisting of two or more loads spaced nominally 1.5 m on centres in absence
of the uniform live loads. Each load shall be 40 percent of the gross weight of the maximum size vehicle to be
accommodated and applied over an area of 750 mm x 750 mm. For the storage of private or pleasure‐type
vehicles without repair or fuelling, floors shall be investigated in the absence of the uniform live load, for a
minimum concentrated wheel load of 9 kN spaced 1.5 m on centres, applied over an area of 750 mm x 750
mm. The uniform live loads for these cases are provided in Table 6.2.3. The condition of concentrated or
uniform live load producing the greater stresses shall govern.

  Notes:
  a It must be ensured that the average weight of equipment, machinery, raw materials and products that may occupy the
   floor is less than the specified value in the Table. In case the weight exceeds the specified values in the Table, actual
   maximum probable weight acting in the actual manner shall be used in the analysis and design.
  b Floors in garages or portions of a building used for the storage of motor vehicles shall be designed for the uniformly
       distributed live loads of Table 6.2.3 or the following concentrated load: (1) for garages restricted to passenger vehicles
       accommodating not more than nine passengers, 13.35 kN acting on an area of 114 mm by 114 mm footprint of a jack; and
       (2) for mechanical parking structures without slab or deck that are used for storing passenger car only, 10 kN per wheel.
   c Garages accommodating trucks and buses shall be designed in accordance with an approved method, which contains
    provisions for truck and bus loadings.
  d The loading applies to stack room floors that support non‐mobile, double‐faced library book stacks subject to the following
       limitations: (1) The nominal book stack unit height shall not exceed 2290 mm; (2) the nominal shelf depth shall not
       exceed 300 mm for each face; (3) parallel rows of double‐faced book stacks shall be separated by aisles not less than 900
       mm wide.
  e Subject to the provisions of reduction of live load as per Sec 2.3.13
  f Uniformly distributed and concentrated load provisions are applicable for a maximum floor height of 3.5 m. In case of
       higher floor height, the load(s) must be proportionally increased.
  g In addition to the vertical live loads, the design shall include horizontal swaying forces applied to each row of the seats as

       follows: 0.350 kN per linear meter of seat applied in a direction parallel to each row of seats and 0.15 kN per linear meter
       of seat applied in a direction perpendicular to each row of seats. The parallel and perpendicular horizontal swaying forces
       need not be applied simultaneously.
  h Where uniform roof live loads are reduced to less than 1.0 kN/m2 in accordance with Sec 2.3.14.1 and are applied to the
       design of structural members arranged so as to create continuity, the reduced roof live load shall be applied to adjacent
       spans or to alternate spans, whichever produces the greatest unfavorable effect.
  i Roofs used for other special purposes shall be designed for appropriate loads as approved by the authority having
     jurisdiction.
  j Other uniform loads in accordance with an approved method, which contains provisions for truck loadings, shall also be
    considered where appropriate.
  k The concentrated wheel load shall be applied on an area of 114 mm by 114 mm footprint of a jack.
  l Minimum concentrated load on stair treads (on area of 2,580 mm2 ) is 1.33 kN.
  * The loading in industrial buildings varies considerably and so the loadings under the terms ‘light,’ ‘medium’ and ‘heavy’ are
       introduced in order to allow for which the relevant floor is designed. It is however important to assess the actual loads to
       ensure that they are not in excess of the stipulated load, in case where they are in excess, the design shall be based on the
       actual loadings.

2.3.6      Provision for Partition Walls

When partitions, not indicated on the plans, are anticipated to be placed on the floors, their weight shall be
included as an additional live load acting as concentrated line loads in an arrangement producing the most
severe effect on the floor, unless it can be shown that a more favourable arrangement of the partitions shall
prevail during the future use of the floor.

In the case of light partitions, wherein the total weight per metre run is not greater than 5.5 kN, a uniformly
distributed live load may be applied on the floor in lieu of the concentrated line loads specified above. Such
uniform live load per square metre shall be at least 33% of the weight per metre run of the partitions, subject to
a minimum of 1.2 kN/m2.
2.3.7      More than One Occupancy
Where an area of a floor is intended for two or more occupancies at different times, the value to be used from
Table 6.2.3 shall be the greatest value for any of the occupancies concerned.

2.3.8      Minimum Roof Live Loads

Roof live loads shall be assumed to act vertically over the area projected by the roof or any portion of it upon a
horizontal plane, and shall be determined as specified in Table 6.2.4.

Note: (1) Greater of this load and rain load as specified in Sec 2.6.2 shall be taken as the design live load for roof. The distributed load
          shall be applied over the area of the roof projected upon a horizontal plane and shall not be applied simultaneously with the
          concentrated load. The concentrated load shall be assumed to act upon a 300 mm x 300 mm area and need not be considered
          for roofs capable of laterally distributing the load, e.g. reinforced concrete slabs.

2.3.9      Loads not Specified

Live loads, not specified for uses or occupancies in Sections 2.3.3, 2.3.4 and 2.3.5, shall be determined from
loads resulting from:

       (a) weight of the probable assembly of persons;

       (b) weight of the probable accumulation of equipment and furniture, and

       (c) weight of the probable storage of materials.

2.3.10 Partial Loading and Other Loading Arrangements

The full intensity of the appropriately reduced live load applied only to a portion of the length or area of a
structure or member shall be considered, if it produces a more unfavourable effect than the same intensity
applied over the full length or area of the structure or member.

Where uniformly distributed live loads are used in the design of continuous members and their supports,
consideration shall be given to full dead load on all spans in combination with full live loads on adjacent spans
and on alternate spans whichever produces a more unfavourable effect.

2.3.11 Other Live Loads
Live loads on miscellaneous structures and components, such as handrails and supporting members, parapets
and balustrades, ceilings, skylights and supports, and the like, shall be determined from the analysis of the
actual loads on them, but shall not be less than those given in Table 6.2.5.

2.3.12 Impact and Dynamic Loads
The live loads specified in Sec 2.3.3 shall be assumed to include allowances for impacts arising from normal uses
only. However, forces imposed by unusual vibrations and impacts resulting from the operation of installed
machinery and equipment shall be determined separately and treated as additional live loads. Live loads due to
vibration or impact shall be determined by dynamic analysis of the supporting member or structure including
foundations, or from the recommended values supplied by the manufacture of the particular equipment or
machinery. In absence of definite information, values listed in Table 6.2.6 for some common equipment, shall be
used for design purposes.

2.3.14 Reduction in Roof Live Loads
The minimum uniformly distributed roof live loads, Lo in Table 6.2.3, are permitted to be reduced according to
the following provisions.

2.3.14.1 Flat, pitched, and curved roofs.

Ordinary flat, pitched, and curved roofs are permitted to be designed for a reduced roof live load, as specified in
Eq. 6.2.2 or other controlling combinations of loads, as discussed later in this Chapter, whichever produces the
greater load. In structures such as greenhouses, where special scaffolding is used as a work surface for workmen
and materials during maintenance and repair operations, a lower roof load than specified in Eq. 6.2.2 shall not
be used unless approved by the authority having jurisdiction. On such structures, the minimum roof live load
shall be 0.60 kN/m2.

                    Lr = LoR1R2        (0.60 ≤ Lr ≤ 1.00)                                       (6.2.2)
Where,
         Lr = reduced roof live load per m2 of horizontal projection in kN/m2
         The reduction factors R1 and R2 shall be determined as follows:
         R1 = 1 for At ≤ 18.58 m2
            = 1.2 − 0.011At for 18.58 m2 < At < 55.74 m2
            = 0.6 for At≥ 55.74 m2
         At = tributary area in m2 supported by any structural member and
         R2 = 1 for F ≤ 4

 For a pitched roof, F = 0.12 × slope, with slope expressed in percentage points and, for an arch or dome,
 F = rise‐to‐span ratio multiplied by 32.

 Roofs that have an occupancy function, such as roof gardens, assembly purposes, or other special purposes are
 permitted to have their uniformly distributed live load reduced in accordance with the requirements of Sec
 2.3.13.




2.5 EARTHQUAKE LOADS
 2.5.1 General
 Minimum design earthquake forces for buildings, structures or components thereof shall be determined in
 accordance with the provisions of Sec 2.5. Some definitions and symbols relevant for earthquake resistant
 design for buildings are provided in Sections 2.1.3 and 2.1.4. Section 2.5.2 presents basic earthquake resistant
 design concepts. Section 2.5.3 describes procedures for soil investigations, while Sec 2.5.4 describes procedures
 for determining earthquake ground motion for design. Section 2.5.5 describes different types of buildings and
 structural systems which possess different earthquake resistant characteristics. Static analysis procedures for
 design are described in Sections 2.5.6, 2.5.7 and 2.5.12. Dynamic analysis procedures are dealt with in Sections
 2.5.8 to 2.5.11. Section 2.5.13 presents how seismic effects are accounted in the design and combination of
 earthquake loading effects in different directions and with other loading effects. Section 2.5.14 deals with
 allowable drift and deformation limits. Section 2.5.15 addresses design of non‐structural components in
 buildings. Section 2.5.16 presents design considerations for buildings with seismic isolation systems. Design for
 soft storey condition in buildings is addressed in Sec 2.5.17.
 2.5.2      Earthquake Resistant Design – Basic Concepts
 2.5.2.1    General principles
 The purpose of earthquake resistant design provisions in this Code is to provide guidelines for the design and
 construction of new structures subject to earthquake ground motions in order to minimize the risk to life for all
 structures, to increase the expected performance of higher occupancy structures as compared to ordinary
 structures, and to improve the capability of essential structures to function after an earthquake. It is not
 economically feasible to design and construct buildings without any damage for a major earthquake event. The
 intent is therefore to allow inelastic deformation and structural damage at preferred locations in the structure
 without endangering structural integrity and to prevent structural collapse during a major earthquake.

 The seismic zoning map (Fig. 6.2.24) divides the country into four seismic zones with different expected levels of
 intensity of ground motion. Each seismic zone has a zone coefficient which provides expected peak ground
 acceleration values on rock/firm soil corresponding to the maximum considered earthquake (MCE). The design
 basis earthquake is taken as 2/3 of the maximum considered earthquake.
 The effects of the earthquake ground motion on the structure is expressed in terms of an idealized elastic design
 acceleration response spectrum, which depends on (a) seismic zone coefficient and local soil conditions defining
 ground motion and (b) importance factor and response reduction factor representing building considerations.
 The earthquake forces acting on the structure is reduced using the response modification/reduction factor R in
 order to take advantage of the inelastic energy dissipation due to inherent ductility and redundancy in the
 structure as well as material over‐strength. The importance factor I increases design forces for important
 structures. The provisions of this Code for ductility and detailing need to be satisfied even for structures and
 members for which load combinations that do not contain the earthquake effect indicate larger demands than
 combinations including earthquake. The elastic deformations calculated under these reduced design forces are
 multiplied by the deflection amplification factor, Cd to estimate the deformations likely to result from the design
 earthquake.

Structural Design

The seismic design guidelines presented in this Section are based on the assumption that the soil supporting the
structure will not liquefy, settle or slide due to loss of strength during the earthquake. Reinforced and
prestressed concrete members shall be suitably designed to ensure that premature failure due to shear or bond
does not occur. Ductile detailing of reinforced concrete members is of prime importance. In steel structures,
members and their connections should be so proportioned that high ductility is obtained, avoiding premature
failure due to elastic or inelastic buckling of any type.

The building structure shall include complete lateral and vertical force‐resisting systems capable of providing
adequate strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation capacity to withstand the design ground motions within the
prescribed limits of deformation and strength demand. The design ground motions shall be assumed to occur
along any horizontal direction of a building structure. The adequacy of the structural systems shall be

demonstrated through the construction of a mathematical model and evaluation of this model for the effects of
design ground motions.
2.5.2.2   Characteristics of Earthquake Resistant Buildings
The desirable characteristics of earthquake resistant buildings are described below:
Structural Simplicity, Uniformity and Symmetry:
Structural simplicity, uniformity and plan symmetry is characterized by an even distribution of mass and
structural elements which allows short and direct transmission of the inertia forces created in the distributed
masses of the building to its foundation. A building configuration with symmetrical layout of structural elements
of the lateral force resisting system, and well‐distributed in‐plan, is desirable. Uniformity along the height of the
building is also important, since it tends to eliminate the occurrence of sensitive zones where concentrations of
stress or large ductility demands might cause premature collapse.
Some basic guidelines are given below:
     (i) With respect to the lateral stiffness and mass distribution, the building structure shall be approximately
         symmetrical in plan with respect to two orthogonal axes.
     (ii) Both the lateral stiffness and the mass of the individual storeys shall remain constant or reduce
          gradually, without abrupt changes, from the base to the top of a particular building.
     (iii) All structural elements of the lateral load resisting systems, such as cores, structural walls, or frames
           shall run without interruption from the foundations to the top of the building.
     (iv) An irregular building may be subdivided into dynamically independent regular units well separated
          against pounding of the individual units to achieve uniformity.
     (v) The length to breadth ratio (h= Lmas/Lmin) of the building in plan shall not be higher than 4, where
         Lmas and Lmin are respectively the larger and smaller in plan dimension of the building, measured in
         orthogonal directions.
Structural Redundancy:
A high degree of redundancy accompanied by redistribution capacity through ductility is desirable, enabling a
more widely spread energy dissipation across the entire structure and an increased total dissipated energy. The
use of evenly distributed structural elements increases redundancy. Structural systems of higher static
indeterminacy may result in higher response reduction factor R.
Horizontal Bi‐directional Resistance and Stiffness:
Horizontal earthquake motion is a bi‐directional phenomenon and thus the building structure needs to resist
horizontal action in any direction. The structural elements of lateral force resisting system should be arranged in
an orthogonal (in plan) pattern, ensuring similar resistance and stiffness characteristics in both main directions.
The stiffness characteristics of the structure should also limit the development of excessive displacements that
might lead to either instabilities due to second order effects or excessive damages.
Torsional Resistance and Stiffness
Besides lateral resistance and stiffness, building structures should possess adequate torsional resistance and
stiffness in order to limit the development of torsional motions which tend to stress the different structural
elements in a non‐uniform way. In this respect, arrangements in which the main elements resisting the seismic
action are distributed close to the periphery of the building present clear advantages.
Diaphragm Behaviour
In buildings, floors (including the roof) act as horizontal diaphragms that collect and transmit the inertia forces
to the vertical structural systems and ensure that those systems act together in resisting the horizontal seismic
action. Floor systems and the roof should be provided with in‐plane stiffness and resistance and with effective
connection to the vertical structural systems. Particular care should be taken in cases of non‐compact or very
elongated in‐plan shapes and in cases of large floor openings, especially if the latter are located in the vicinity of
the main vertical structural elements, thus hindering such effective connection between the vertical and

horizontal structure. The in‐plane stiffness of the floors shall be sufficiently large in comparison with the lateral
stiffness of the vertical structural elements, so that the deformation of the floor shall have a small effect on the
distribution of the forces among the vertical structural elements.
Foundation
The design and construction of the foundation and of its connection to the superstructure shall ensure that the
whole building is subjected to a uniform seismic excitation. For buildings with individual foundation elements
(footings or piles), the use of a foundation slab or tie‐beams between these elements in both main directions is
recommended, as described in Chapter 3.
2.5.3      Investigation and Assessment of Site Conditions
2.5.3.1    Site investigation
Appropriate site investigations should be carried out to identify the ground conditions influencing the seismic
action.

The ground conditions at the building site should normally be free from risks of ground rupture, slope instability
and permanent settlements caused by liquefaction or densification during an earthquake. The possibility of such
phenomena should be investigated in accordance with standard procedures described in Chapter 3 of this Part.

The intent of the site investigation is to classify the Site into one of types SA, SB, SC, SD, SE, S1 and S2 as defined
in Sec 2.5.3.2. Such classification is based on site profile and evaluated soil properties (shear wave velocity,
Standard Penetration Resistance, undrained shear strength, soil type). The site class is used to determine the
effect of local soil conditions on the earthquake ground motion.

For sites representing special soil type S1 or S2, site specific special studies for the ground motion should be
done. Soil type S1, having very low shear wave velocity and low material damping, can produce anomalous
seismic site amplification and soil‐structure interaction effects. For S2 soils, possibility of soil failure should be
studied.
For a structure belonging to Seismic Design Category C or D (Sec 2.5.5.2), site investigation should also include
determination of soil parameters for the assessment of the following:
       (a) Slope instability.
       (b) Potential for Liquefaction and loss of soil strength.
       (c) Differential settlement.
       (d) Surface displacement due to faulting or lateral spreading.
       (e) Lateral pressures on basement walls and retaining walls due to earthquake ground motion.

Liquefaction potential and possible consequences should be evaluated for design earthquake ground motions
consistent with peak ground accelerations. Any Settlement due to densification of loose granular soils under
design earthquake motion should be studied. The occurrence and consequences of geologic hazards such as
slope instability or surface faulting should also be considered. The dynamic lateral earth pressure on basement
walls and retaining walls during earthquake ground shaking is to be considered as an earthquake load for use in
design load combinations
2.5.3.2    Site classification

Site will be classified as type SA, SB, SC, SD, SE, S1 and S2 based on the provisions of this Section. Classification
will be done in accordance with Table 6.2.13 based on the soil properties of upper 30 meters of the site profile.
Average soil properties will be determined as given in the following equations:

The site profile up to a depth of 30 m is divided into n number of distinct soil or rock layers. Where some of the
layers are cohesive, k is the number of cohesive layers. Hence ∑ni=1 di = 30 m, while ∑k i=1 dci < 30 m if k€ n
in other words if there are both cohesionless and cohesive layers. The standard penetration value N as directly
measured in the field without correction will be used.
The site classification should be done using average shear wave velocity V̄c if this can be estimated, otherwise
the value of N̄ may be used.

2.5.4     Earthquake Ground Motion
2.5.4.1   Regional seismicity

Bangladesh can be affected by moderate to strong earthquake events due to its proximity to the collision
boundary of the Northeast moving Indian plate and Eurasian Plate. Strong historical earthquakes with
magnitude greater than 7.0 have affected parts of Bangladesh in the last 150 years, some of them had their
epicenters within the country. A brief description of the local geology, tectonic features and earthquake
occurrence in the region is given in Appendix B.

    2.5.4.2   Seismic zoning

    The intent of the seismic zoning map is to give an indication of the Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE)
    motion at different parts of the country. In probabilistic terms, the MCE motion may be considered to
    correspond to having a 2% probability of exceedance within a period of 50 years. The country has been divided
    into four seismic zones with different levels of ground motion. Table 6.2.14 includes a description of the four
    seismic zones. Figure 6.2.24 presents a map of Bangladesh showing the boundaries of the four zones. Each zone
    has a seismic zone coefficient (Z) which represents the maximum considered peak ground acceleration (PGA) on
    very stiff soil/rock (site class SA) in units of g (acceleration due to gravity). The zone coefficients (Z) of the four
    zones are: Z=0.12 (Zone 1), Z=0.20 (Zone 2), Z=0.28 (Zone 3) and Z=0.36 (Zone 4). Table 6.2.15 lists zone
    coefficients for some important towns of Bangladesh. The most severe earthquake prone zone, Zone 4 is in the
    northeast which includes Sylhet and has a maximum PGA value of 0.36g. Dhaka city falls in the moderate seismic
    intensity zone with Z=0.2, while Chittagong city falls in a severe intensity zone with Z=0.28.
    2.5.4.3   Design response spectrum

    The earthquake ground motion for which the building has to be designed is represented by the design response
    spectrum. Both static and dynamic analysis methods are based on this response spectrum. This spectrum
    represents the spectral acceleration for which the building has to be designed as a function of the building
    period, taking into account the ground motion intensity. The spectrum is based on elastic analysis but in order
    to account for energy dissipation due to inelastic deformation and benefits of structural redundancy, the
    spectral accelerations are reduced by the response modification factor R. For important structures, the spectral
    accelerations are increased by the importance factor I. The design basis earthquake (DBE) ground motion is
    selected at a ground shaking level that is 2/3 of the maximum considered earthquake (MCE) ground motion. The
    effect of local soil conditions on the response spectrum is incorporated in the normalized acceleration response
    spectrum Cs. The spectral acceleration for the design earthquake is given by the following equation:

                                 2 ZI                                                                 (6.2.34)

              R = Response reduction factor which depends on the type of structural system given in Table 6.2.19.

of η cannot be smaller than 0.55.

The anticipated (design basis earthquake) peak ground acceleration (PGA) for rock or very stiff soil (site class SA)

is 3 Z. However, for design, the ground motion is modified through the use of response reduction factor R and
                                               2 ZI
importance factor I, resulting in PGArock =        ( ). Figure 6.2.26 shows the normalized acceleration response

spectrum Cs for 5% damping, which may be defined as the 5% damped spectral acceleration (obtained by Eq.
6.2.34) normalized with respect to PGArock . This Figure demonstrates the significant influence of site class on
the response spectrum.

Design Spectrum for Elastic Analysis

For site classes SA to SE, the design acceleration response spectrum for elastic analysis methods is obtained
using Eq. 6.2.34 to compute Sa (in units of g) as a function of period T. The design acceleration response
spectrum represents the expected ground motion (Design Basis Earthquake) divided by the factor R/I.

Design Spectrum for Inelastic Analysis

For inelastic analysis methods, the anticipated ground motion (Design Basis Earthquake) is directly used.
Corresponding real design acceleration response spectrum is used, which is obtained by using R=1 and I=1 in Eq.
6.2.34. The ‘real design acceleration response spectrum’ is equal to ‘design acceleration response spectrum’
multiplied by R/I.

Site‐Specific Design Spectrum

For site class S1 and S2, site‐specific studies are needed to obtain design response spectrum. For important
projects, site‐specific studies may also be carried out to determine spectrum instead of using Eq. 6.2.34. The
objective of such site‐specific ground‐motion analysis is to determine ground motions for local seismic and site
conditions with higher confidence than is possible using simplified equations.

2.5.5      Building Categories
2.5.5.1    Importance factor

Buildings are classified in four occupancy categories in Chapter 1 (Table 6.1.1), depending on the consequences
of collapse for human life, on their importance for public safety and civil protection in the immediate post‐
earthquake period, and on the social and economic consequences of collapse. Depending on occupancy
category, buildings may be designed for higher seismic forces using importance factor greater than one. Table
6.2.17 defines different occupancy categories and corresponding importance factor.

2.5.5.2    Seismic design category

Buildings shall be assigned a seismic design category among B, C or D based on seismic zone, local site
conditions and importance class of building, as given in Table 6.2.18. Seismic design category D has the most
stringent seismic design detailing, while seismic design category B has the least seismic design detailing
requirements.

2.5.5.3       Building irregularity
Buildings with irregularity in plan or elevation suffer much more damage in earthquakes than buildings with
regular configuration. A building may be considered as irregular, if at least one of the conditions given below are
applicable:
                Plan irregularity: Following are the different types of irregularities that may exist in the plan of a
building.
        (i) Torsion irregularity
              To be considered for rigid floor diaphragms, when the maximum storey drift (∆mas) as shown in Figure
              6.2.27(a), computed including accidental torsion, at one end of the structure is more than 1.2 times the
                                    +∆min
              average (∆avg= ∆max             ) of the storey drifts at the two ends of the structure. If ∆masΣ 1.4∆avg then
                                      2
              the irregularity is termed as extreme torsional irregularity.
        (ii) Re‐entrant corners
              Both projections of the structure beyond a re‐entrant comer [Figure 6.2.27(b)] are greater than 15
              percent of its plan dimension in the given direction.
        (iii) Diaphragm Discontinuity
              Diaphragms with abrupt discontinuities or variations in stiffness, including those having cut‐out [Figure
              6.2.27(c)] or open areas greater than 50 percent of the gross enclosed diaphragm area, or changes in
              effective diaphragm stiffness of more than 50 percent from one storey to the next.
        (iv) Out‐ of‐Plane Offsets
              Discontinuities in a lateral force resistance path, such as out of‐plane offsets of vertical elements, as
              shown in Figure 6.2.27(d).
        (v) Non‐parallel Systems
The vertical elements resisting the lateral force are not parallel to or symmetric [Figure 6.2.27(e)] about the
major orthogonal axes of the lateral force resisting elements.

          Vertical Irregularity: Following are different types of irregularities that may exist along vertical
elevations of a building.
  (i)         Stiffness Irregularity ‐ Soft Storey
              A soft storey is one in which the lateral stiffness is less than 70% of that in the storey above or less than
              80% of the average lateral stiffness of the three storeys above irregularity [Figure 6.2.28(a)]. An
              extreme soft storey is defined where its lateral stiffness is less than 60% of that in the storey above or
              less than 70% of the average lateral stiffness of the three storeys above.
  (ii)        Mass Irregularity
              The seismic weight of any storey is more than twice of that of its adjacent storeys [Figure 6.2.28(b)].
              This irregularity need not be considered in case of roofs.
  (iii)       Vertical Geometric Irregularity
              This irregularity exists for buildings with setbacks with dimensions given in Figure 6.2.28(c).
  (iv)        Vertical In‐Plane Discontinuity in Vertical Elements Resisting Lateral Force
              An in‐plane offset of the lateral force resisting elements greater than the length of those elements
              Figure 6.2.28(d).

Structural Design

  (v)     Discontinuity in Capacity ‐ Weak Storey
          A weak storey is one in which the storey lateral strength is less than 80% of that in the storey above.
          The storey lateral strength is the total strength of all seismic force resisting elements sharing the storey
          shear in the considered direction [Figure 6.2.28(e)]. An extreme weak storey is one where the storey
          lateral strength is less than 65% of that in the storey above.
2.5.5.4   Type of structural systems

The basic lateral and vertical seismic force–resisting system shall conform to one of the types A to G indicated in
Table 6.2.19. Each type is again subdivided by the types of vertical elements used to resist lateral seismic forces.
A combination of systems may also be permitted as stated in Sec 2.5.5.5.
The structural system to be used shall be in accordance with the seismic design category indicated in Table
6.2.18. Structural systems that are not permitted for a certain seismic design category are indicated by “NP”.
Structural systems that do not have any height restriction are indicated by “NL”. Where there is height limit, the
maximum height in meters is given.
The response reduction factor, R, and the deflection amplification factor, Cd indicated in Table 6.2.19 shall be
used in determining the design base shear and design story drift. The selected seismic force‐resisting system
shall be designed and detailed in accordance with the specific requirements for the system.
Seismic force resisting systems that are not given in Table 6.2.19 may be permitted if substantial analytical and
test data are submitted that establish the dynamic characteristics and demonstrate the lateral force resistance
and energy dissipation capacity to be equivalent to the structural systems listed in Table 6.2.19 for equivalent
response modification coefficient, R, and deflection amplification factor, Cd values.

2.5.5.5   Combination of structural systems

           Combinations of Structural Systems in Different Directions: Different seismic force–resisting systems
are permitted to be used to resist seismic forces along each of the two orthogonal axes of the structure. Where
different systems are used, the respective R and Cd coefficients shall apply to each system, including the
limitations on system use contained in Table 6.2.19.
           Combinations of Structural Systems in the Same Direction: Where different seismic force–resisting
systems are used in combination to resist seismic forces in the same direction of structural response, other than
those combinations considered as dual systems, the more stringent system limitation contained in Table 6.2.19
shall apply. The value of R used for design in that direction shall not be greater than the least value of R for any
of the systems utilized in that direction. The deflection amplification factor, Cd in the direction under
consideration at any story shall not be less than the largest value of this factor for the R factor used in the same
direction being considered.

Columns, beams, trusses, or slabs supporting discontinuous walls or frames of structures having horizontal
irregularity Type IV of Table 6.1.5 or vertical irregularity Type IV of Table 6.1.4 shall have the design strength to
resist the maximum axial force that can develop in accordance with the load combinations with overstrength
factor of Section 2.5.13.4. The connections of such discontinuous elements to the supporting members shall be
adequate to transmit the forces for which the discontinuous elements were required to be designed.

and to collectors and for connections of collectors to the vertical elements. Collectors and their connections
also shall be designed for these increased forces unless they are designed for the load combinations with
overstrength factor of Section 2.5.5.4, in accordance with Section 2.5.13.4.
          Collector Elements Requiring Load Combinations with Overstrength Factor for Seismic Design
Categories C through E.
In structures assigned to Seismic Design Category C, D or E, collector elements, splices, and their connections to
resisting elements shall resist the load combinations with overstrength of Section 2.5.13.4.
              Batter Piles.

Batter piles and their connections shall be capable of resisting forces and moments from the load combinations
with overstrength factor of Section 2.5.13.4. Where vertical and batter piles act jointly to resist foundation
forces as a group, these forces shall be distributed to the individual piles in accordance with their relative
horizontal and vertical rigidities and the geometric distribution of the piles within the group.
2.5.6       Static Analysis Procedure
Although analysis of buildings subjected to dynamic earthquake loads should theoretically require dynamic
analysis procedures, for certain type of building structures subjected to earthquake shaking, simplified static
analysis procedures may also provide reasonably good results. The equivalent static force method is such a
procedure for determining the seismic lateral forces acting on the structure. This type of analysis may be applied
to buildings whose seismic response is not significantly affected by contributions from modes higher than the
fundamental mode in each direction. This requirement is deemed to be satisfied in buildings which fulfill the
following two conditions:
          (a) The building period in the two main horizontal directions is smaller than both 4TC (TC is defined in Sec
              2.5.4.3) and 2 seconds.
          (b) The building does not possess irregularity in elevation as defined in Sec 2.5.5.3.
2.5.7       Equivalent Static Analysis

The evaluation of the seismic loads starts with the calculation of the design base shear which is derived from the
design response spectrum presented in Sec 2.5.4.3. This Section presents different computations relevant to the
equivalent static analysis procedure.
2.5.7.1     Design base shear
The seismic design base shear force in a given direction shall be determined from the following relation:

                    V  SaW                                                                        (6.2.37)

Where,
            Sa = Lateral seismic force coefficient calculated using Eq. 6.2.34 (Sec 2.5.4.3). It is the design spectral
                  acceleration (in units of g) corresponding to the building period T (computed as per Sec 2.5.7.2).
            W = Total seismic weight of the building defined in Sec 2.5.7.3
Alternatively, for buildings with natural period less than or equal to 2.0 sec., the seismic design base shear can
be calculated using ASCE 7‐02 with seismic design parameters as given in Appendix C. However, the minimum
value of Sa should not be less than 0.044 SDSI. The values of SDS are provided in Table 6.C.4 Appendix C.
2.5.7.2     Building period
The fundamental period T of the building in the horizontal direction under consideration shall be determined
using the following guidelines:
     (a) Structural dynamics procedures (such as Rayleigh method or modal eigenvalue analysis), using
         structural properties and deformation characteristics of resisting elements, may be used to determine
         the fundamental period T of the building in the direction under consideration. This period shall not
         exceed the approximate fundamental period determined by Eq. 6.2.38 by more than 40 percent.

         (b) The building period T (in secs) may be approximated by the following formula:
                       T = Ct(hn)m                                                                               (6.2.38)
              Where,
                  hn = Height of building in metres from foundation or from top of rigid basement. This excludes the
                        basement storeys, where basement walls are connected with the ground floor deck or fitted
                        between the building columns. But it includes the basement storeys, when they are not so
                        connected. Ct and m are obtained from Table 6.2.20
         (c) For masonry or concrete shear wall structures, the approximate fundamental period, T in sec may be
             determined as follows:

         (c) Total weight (100 percent) of permanent heavy equipment or retained liquid or any imposed load
             sustained in nature shall be included.
    Where the probable imposed loads (mass) at the time of earthquake are more correctly assessed, the designer
    may go for higher percentage of live load.
    2.5.7.4   Vertical distribution of lateral forces

  Where,

           wi and ws = Part of the total effective seismic weight of the structure (W) assigned to level i or x
           hi and hs = the height from the base to level i or x

             = linear interpolation between 1 and 2 for other periods.
           n = number of stories
2.5.7.5    Storey shear and its horizontal distribution
The design storey shear Vs, at any storey x is the sum of the forces Fs in that storey and all other stories above
it, given by Eq. 6.2.42:
                           n
                    Vx  Fi                                                                      (6.2.42)
                           ix

Where, Fi = Portion of base shear induced at level i, as determined by Eq. 6.2.41.
If the floor diaphragms can be considered to be infinitely rigid in the horizontal plane, the shear Vs shall be
distributed to the various elements of the lateral force resisting system in proportion to their relative lateral
stiffness. For flexible diaphragms, the distribution of forces to the vertical elements shall account for the
position and distribution of the masses supported.
Allowance shall also be made for the increased shear arising due to horizontal torsional moment as specified in
Sec 2.5.7.6
2.5.7.6    Horizontal torsional moments
Design shall accommodate increase in storey shear forces resulting from probable horizontal torsional moments
on rigid floor diaphragms. Computation of such moments shall be as follows:
            In‐built torsional effects: When there is in‐built eccentricity between centre of mass and centre of
rigidity (lateral resistance) at floor levels, rigid diaphragms at each level will be subject to torsional moment Mt.
           Accidental torsional effects: In order to account for uncertainties in the location of masses and in the
spatial variation of the seismic motion, accidental torsional effects need to be always considered. The accidental
moment Mta is determined assuming the storey mass to be displaced from the calculated centre of mass a
distance equal to 5 percent of the building dimension at that level perpendicular to the direction of the force
under consideration. The accidental torsional moment Mtai at level i is given as:
                                                                                                  (6.2.43)

           ±0.05Li
           Li = floor dimension perpendicular to the direction of seismic force considered.
Where torsional irregularity exists (Sec 2.5.5.3.1) for Seismic Design Category C or D, the irregularity effects shall
be accounted for by increasing the accidental torsion Mta at each level by a torsional amplification factor, As as
illustrated in Figure 6.2.29 determined from the following equation:
                                      2

The accidental torsional moment need not be amplified for structures of light‐frame construction. Also the

accidental torsional moment Mta plus the inbuilt torsional moment Mt (if any). Where earthquake forces are
applied concurrently in two orthogonal directions, the required 5 percent displacement of the center of mass
(for accidental torsion) need not be applied in both of the orthogonal directions at the same time, but shall be
applied in only one direction that produces the greater effect.

2.5.7.4. At any story, the increment of overturning moment in the story under consideration shall be distributed
to the various vertical force resisting elements in the same proportion as the distribution of the horizontal
shears to those elements. The overturning moments at level x, Ms shall be determined as follows:

  2.5.8     Dynamic Analysis Methods
  Dynamic analysis method involves applying principles of structural dynamics to compute the response of the
  structure to applied dynamic (earthquake) loads.
  2.5.8.1   Requirement for dynamic analysis
  Dynamic analysis should be performed to obtain the design seismic force, and its distribution to different levels
  along the height of the building and to the various lateral load resisting elements, for the following buildings:
       (a) Regular buildings with height greater than 40 m in Zones 2, 3, 4 and greater than 90 m in Zone 1.
       (b) Irregular buildings (as defined in Sec 2.5.5.3) with height greater than 12 m in Zones 2, 3, 4 and greater
           than 40 m in Zone 1.
  For irregular buildings, smaller than 40 m in height in Zone 1, dynamic analysis, even though not mandatory, is
  recommended.
  2.5.8.2   Methods of analysis
  Dynamic analysis may be carried out through the following two methods:
       (i) Response Spectrum Analysis method is a linear elastic analysis method using modal analysis
           procedures, where the structure is subjected to spectral accelerations corresponding to a design
           acceleration response spectrum. The design earthquake ground motion in this case is represented by its
           response spectrum.
       (ii) Time History Analysis method is a numerical integration procedure where design ground motion time
            histories (acceleration record) are applied at the base of the structure. Time history analysis procedures
            can be two types: linear and non‐linear.

2.5.9     Response Spectrum Analysis (RSA)

A response spectrum analysis shall consist of the analysis of a linear mathematical model of the structure to
determine the maximum accelerations, forces, and displacements resulting from the dynamic response to
ground shaking represented by the design acceleration response spectrum (presented in Sec 2.5.4.3). Response
spectrum analysis is also called a modal analysis procedure because it considers different modes of vibration of
the structure and combines effects of different modes.
2.5.9.1   Modeling (RSA)
A mathematical model of the structure shall be constructed that represents the spatial distribution of mass and
stiffness throughout the structure. For regular structures with independent orthogonal seismic‐force‐resisting
systems, independent two‐dimensional models are permitted to be constructed to represent each system. For
irregular structures or structures without independent orthogonal systems, a three‐dimensional model
incorporating a minimum of three dynamic degrees of freedom consisting of translation in two orthogonal plan
directions and torsional rotation about the vertical axis shall be included at each level of the structure. Where
the diaphragms are not rigid compared to the vertical elements of the lateral‐force‐resisting system, the model
should include representation of the diaphragm’s flexibility and such additional dynamic degrees of freedom as
are required to account for the participation of the diaphragm in the structure’s dynamic response. The
structure shall be considered to be fixed at the base or, alternatively, it shall be permitted to use realistic
assumptions with regard to the stiffness of foundations. In addition, the model shall comply with the following:
(a) Stiffness properties of concrete and masonry elements shall consider the effects of cracked sections
(b) The contribution of panel zone deformations to overall story drift shall be included for steel moment frame
    resisting systems.
2.5.9.2   Number of modes (RSA)
An analysis shall be conducted using the masses and elastic stiffnesses of the seismic‐force‐resisting system to
determine the natural modes of vibration for the structure including the period of each mode, the modal shape
vector $, the modal participation factor P and modal mass M. The analysis shall include a sufficient number of
modes to obtain a combined modal mass participation of at least 90 percent of the actual mass in each of two
orthogonal directions.
2.5.9.3   Modal story shears and moments (RSA)

For each mode, the story shears, story overturning moments, and the shear forces and overturning moments in
vertical elements of the structural system at each level due to the seismic forces shall be computed. The peak
lateral force Fik induced at level i in mode k is given by:
                   Fik = Ak$ikPkWi                                                           (6.2.50)
Where,
          Ak = Design horizontal spectral acceleration corresponding to period of vibration Tk of mode k
               obtained from design response spectrum (Sec 2.5.4.3)
          $ik = Modal shape coefficient at level i in mode k
          Pk = Modal participation factor of mode k
          Wi = Weight of floor i.
2.5.9.4   Structure response (RSA)

In the response spectrum analysis method, the base shear Vrc; each of the story shear, moment, and drift
quantities; and the deflection at each level shall be determined by combining their modal values. The
combination shall be carried out by taking the square root of the sum of the squares (SRSS) of each of the modal
values or by the complete quadratic combination (CQC) technique. The complete quadratic combination shall be
used where closely spaced periods in the translational and torsional modes result in cross‐correlation of the
modes.

The distribution of horizontal shear shall be in accordance with the requirements of Sec 2.5.7.5. It should be
noted that amplification of accidental torsion as per Sec 2.5.7.6 is not required where accidental torsional
effects are included in the dynamic analysis model by offsetting the centre of mass in each story by the required
amount.

A base shear, V shall also be calculated using the equivalent static force procedure in Sec 2.5.7. Where the base
shear, Vrc is less than 85 percent of V all the forces but not the drifts obtained by response spectrum analysis
                                   0.85V
shall be multiplied by the ratio          .

The displacements and drifts obtained by response spectrum analysis shall be multiplied by Cd/I to obtain
design displacements and drifts, as done in equivalent static analysis procedure (Sec 2.5.7.7). The P‐delta effects
shall be determined in accordance with Sec 2.5.7.9.
2.5.10 Linear Time History Analysis (LTHA)

A linear time history analysis (LTHA) shall consist of an analysis of a linear mathematical model of the structure
to determine its response, through direct numerical integration of the differential equations of motion, to a
number of ground motion acceleration time histories compatible with the design response spectrum for the
site. The analysis shall be performed in accordance with the provisions of this Section. For the purposes of
analysis, the structure shall be permitted to be considered to be fixed at the base or, alternatively, it shall be
permitted to use realistic assumptions with regard to the stiffness of foundations. The acceleration time history
(ground motion) is applied at the base of the structure. The advantage of this procedure is that the time
dependent behavior of the structural response is obtained.
2.5.10.1 Modeling (LTHA)
Mathematical models shall conform to the requirements of modeling described in Sec 2.5.9.1.
2.5.10.2 Ground motion (LTHA)
At least three appropriate ground motions (acceleration time history) shall be used in the analysis. Ground
motion shall conform to the requirements of this Section.
Two‐dimensional analysis: Where two‐dimensional analyses are performed, each ground motion shall consist
of a horizontal acceleration time history selected from an actual recorded event. Appropriate acceleration
histories shall be obtained from records of events having magnitudes, fault distance, and source mechanisms
that are consistent with those that control the maximum considered earthquake. Where the required number
of appropriate ground motion records are not available, appropriate simulated ground motion time histories
shall be used to make up the total number required. The ground motions shall be scaled such that for each
period between 0.2T and 1.5T (where T is the natural period of the structure in the fundamental mode for the
direction considered) the average of the five‐percent‐damped response spectra for the each acceleration time
history is not less than the corresponding ordinate of the design acceleration response spectrum, determined in
accordance with Sec 2.5.4.3.

Three‐dimensional analysis: Where three‐dimensional analysis is performed, ground motions shall consist of
pairs of appropriate horizontal ground motion acceleration time histories (in two orthogonal horizontal
directions) that shall be selected and scaled from individual recorded events. Appropriate ground motions shall
be selected from events having magnitudes, fault distance, and source mechanisms that are consistent with
those that control the maximum considered earthquake. Where the required number of recorded ground
motion pairs are not available, appropriate simulated ground motion pairs shall be used to make up the total
number required. For each pair of horizontal ground motion components, an SRSS spectrum shall be
constructed by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the five‐percent‐damped response spectra
for the components (where an identical scale factor is applied to both components of a pair). Each pair of
motions shall be scaled such that for each period between 0.2T and 1.5T (where T is the natural period of the
fundamental mode of the structure) the average of the SRSS spectra from all horizontal component pairs is not
less than 1.3 times the corresponding ordinate of the design response spectrum, determined in accordance with
Sec 2.5.4.3.

2.5.10.3 Structure response (LTHA)

For each scaled acceleration time history, the maximum values of base shear and other structure response
quantities shall be obtained from the time history analysis. For three dimensional analysis, orthogonal pair of
scaled motions are applied simultaneously. A base shear, V, shall also be calculated using the equivalent static
force procedure described in Sec 2.5.7.1. Where the maximum base shear, Vth computed by linear time history
analysis, is less than V, all response quantities (storey shear, moments, drifts, floor deflections, member forces
                                                                                                 V
etc) obtained by time history analysis shall be increased by multiplying with the ratio, V . If number of
                                                                                                 th
earthquake records (or pairs) used in the analysis is less than seven, the maximum structural response obtained
corresponding to different earthquake records shall be considered as the design value. If the number is at least
seven, then the average of maximum structural responses for different earthquake records shall be considered
as the design value.
                                                                                        Cd
The displacements and drifts obtained as mentioned above shall be multiplied by                  to obtain design

2.5.11 Non‐Linear Time History Analysis (NTHA)

Nonlinear time history analysis (NTHA) shall consist of analysis of a mathematical model of the structure which
incorporates the nonlinear hysteretic behavior of the structure’s components to determine its response,
through methods of numerical integration, to ground acceleration time histories compatible with the design
response spectrum for the site. The analysis shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of this
Section. For the purposes of analysis, the structure shall be permitted to be considered to be fixed at the base
or, alternatively, it shall be permitted to use realistic assumptions with regard to the stiffness of foundations.
The acceleration time history (ground motion) is applied at the base of the structure. The advantage of this
procedure is that actual time dependent behavior of the structural response considering inelastic deformations
in the structure can be obtained.
2.5.11.1 Modeling (NTHA)
A mathematical model of the structure shall be constructed that represents the spatial distribution of mass
throughout the structure. The hysteretic behavior of elements shall be modeled consistent with suitable
laboratory test data and shall account for all significant yielding, strength degradation, stiffness degradation,
and hysteretic pinching indicated by such test data. Strength of elements shall be based on expected values
considering material over‐strength, strain hardening, and hysteretic strength degradation. As a minimum, a
bilinear force deformation relationship should be used at the element level. In reinforced concrete and masonry
buildings, the elastic stiffness should correspond to that of cracked sections. Linear properties, consistent with
the provisions of Chapter 5 shall be permitted to be used for those elements demonstrated by the analysis to
remain within their linear range of response. The structure shall be assumed to have a fixed base or,
alternatively, it shall be permitted to use realistic assumptions with regard to the stiffness and load carrying
characteristics of the foundations consistent with site‐specific soils data and rational principles of engineering
mechanics.

For regular structures with independent orthogonal seismic‐force‐resisting systems, independent two
dimensional models shall be permitted to be constructed to represent each system. For structures having plan
irregularity or structures without independent orthogonal systems, a three‐dimensional model incorporating a
minimum of three dynamic degrees of freedom consisting of translation in two orthogonal plan directions and
torsional rotation about the vertical axis at each level of the structure shall be used. Where the diaphragms are
not rigid compared to the vertical elements of the lateral‐force‐resisting system, the model shall include
representation of the diaphragm’s flexibility and such additional dynamic degrees of freedom as are required to
account for the participation of the diaphragm in the structure’s dynamic response.
2.5.11.2 Ground motion (NTHA)
The actual time‐dependent inelastic deformation of the structure is modeled. For inelastic analysis method, the
real design acceleration response spectrum (Sec 2.5.4.3) is obtained using Eq. 6.2.34 with R=1 and I=1. The real

At least three appropriate acceleration time histories shall be used in the analysis. Ground motion shall conform
to the requirements of this Section.
Two‐dimensional analysis
Where two‐dimensional analyses are performed, each ground motion shall consist of a horizontal acceleration
time history selected from an actual recorded event. Appropriate acceleration histories shall be obtained from
records of events having magnitudes, fault distance, and source mechanisms that are consistent with those that
control the maximum considered earthquake. Where the required number of appropriate ground motion
records are not available, appropriate simulated ground motion time histories shall be used to make up the total
number required. The ground motions shall be scaled such that for each period between 0.2T and 1.5T (where T
is the natural period of the structure in the fundamental mode for the direction considered) the average of the
five‐percent‐damped response spectra for each acceleration time history is not less than the corresponding
ordinate of the real design acceleration response spectrum, as defined here.
Three‐dimensional analysis
Where three‐dimensional analysis is performed, ground motions shall consist of pairs of appropriate horizontal
ground motion acceleration time histories (in two orthogonal horizontal directions) that shall be selected and
scaled from individual recorded events. Appropriate ground motions shall be selected from events having
magnitudes, fault distance, and source mechanisms that are consistent with those that control the maximum
considered earthquake. Where the required number of recorded ground motion pairs are not available,
appropriate simulated ground motion pairs shall be used to make up the total number required. For each pair of
horizontal ground motion components, an SRSS spectrum shall be constructed by taking the square root of the
sum of the squares of the five‐percent‐damped response spectra for the components (where an identical scale
factor is applied to both components of a pair). Each pair of motions shall be scaled such that for each period
between 0.2T and 1.5T (where T is the natural period of the fundamental mode of the structure) the average of
the SRSS spectra from all horizontal component pairs is not less than 1.3 times the corresponding ordinate of
the real design acceleration response spectrum.
2.5.11.3 Structure response (NTHA)

For each scaled acceleration time history, the maximum values of base shear and other structure response
quantities shall be obtained from the nonlinear time history analysis. For three dimensional analysis, orthogonal
pair of scaled motions are applied simultaneously. If number of earthquake records (or pairs) used in the
analysis is less than seven, the maximum structural response obtained corresponding to different earthquake
records shall be considered as the design value. If the number is at least seven, then the average of maximum
structural responses for different earthquake records shall be considered as the design value. Since real
expected earthquake motion input and model incorporating real nonlinear behavior of the structure is used, the
results as obtained are directly used (no scaling as in LTHA or RSA is required) for interpretation and design.
2.5.11.4 Structure member design (NTHA)
The adequacy of individual members and their connections to withstand the design deformations predicted by
the analyses shall be evaluated based on laboratory test data for similar components. The effects of gravity and
other loads on member deformation capacity shall be considered in these evaluations. Member deformation
shall not exceed two thirds of the smaller of: the value that results in loss of ability to carry gravity loads or the
value at which member strength has deteriorated to less than 67 percent of peak strength.
2.5.11.5 Design review (NTHA)
Special care and expertise is needed in the use of nonlinear dynamic analysis based design. Checking of the
design by competent third party is recommended. A review of the design of the seismic‐force‐resisting system
and the supporting structural analyses shall be performed by an independent team consisting of design
professionals with experience in seismic analysis methods and the theory and application of nonlinear seismic

2.5.12   Non‐Linear Static Analysis (NSA)

Nonlinear static analysis (NSA), also popularly known as pushover analysis, is a simplified method of directly
evaluating nonlinear response of structures to strong earthquake ground shaking. It is an alternative to the
more complex nonlinear time history analysis (NTHA). The building is subjected to monotonically increasing
static horizontal loads under constant gravity load.
2.5.12.1 Modeling (NSA)
A mathematical model of the structure shall be constructed to represent the spatial distribution of mass and
stiffness of the structural system considering the effects of element nonlinearity for deformation levels that
exceed the proportional limit. P‐Delta effects shall also be included in the analysis.
For regular structures with independent orthogonal seismic‐force‐resisting systems, independent two‐
dimensional models may be used to represent each system. For structures having plan irregularities or
structures without independent orthogonal systems, a three‐dimensional model incorporating a minimum of
three degrees of freedom for each level of the structure, consisting of translation in two orthogonal plan
directions and torsional rotation about the vertical axis, shall be used. Where the diaphragms are not rigid
compared to the vertical elements of the seismic‐force‐resisting system, the model should include
representation of the diaphragm flexibility.

Unless analysis indicates that an element remains elastic, a nonlinear force deformation model shall be used to
represent the stiffness of the element before onset of yield, the yield strength, and the stiffness properties of
the element after yield at various levels of deformation. Strengths of elements shall not exceed expected values
considering material over‐strength and strain hardening. The properties of elements and components after
yielding shall account for strength and stiffness degradation due to softening, buckling, or fracture as indicated
by principles of mechanics or test data.

A control point shall be selected for the model. For normal buildings, the control point shall be at the center of
mass of the highest level (roof) of the structure.
2.5.12.2 Analysis procedure (NSA)

The lateral forces shall be applied at the center of mass of each level and shall be proportional to the
distribution obtained from a modal analysis for the fundamental mode of response in the direction under
consideration. The lateral loads shall be increased incrementally in a monotonic manner.

At the jth increment of lateral loading, the total lateral force applied to the model shall be characterized by the
term Vj . The incremental increases in applied lateral force should be in steps that are sufficiently small to permit
significant changes in individual element behavior (such as yielding, buckling or failure) to be detected. The first
increment in lateral loading shall result in linear elastic behavior. At each loading step, the total applied lateral
force, Vjthe lateral displacement of the control point, ðj and the forces and deformations in each element shall
be recorded. The analysis shall be continued until the displacement of the control point is at least 150 percent of
the target displacement determined in accordance with Sec.2.5.12.3. The structure shall be designed so that the
total applied lateral force does not decrease in any load increment for control point displacements less than or
equal to 125 percent of the target displacement.
2.5.12.3 Effective period and target displacement (NSA)

A bilinear curve shall be fitted to the capacity curve, such that the first segment of the bilinear curve coincides
with the capacity curve at 60 percent of the effective yield strength, the second segment coincides with the
capacity curve at the target displacement, and the area under the bilinear curve equals the area under the

    displacement is reached.

    The adequacy of individual members and their connections to withstand the member forces and member
    deformations shall be evaluated based on laboratory test data for similar components. The effects of gravity and
    other loads on member deformation capacity shall be considered in these evaluations. The deformation of a
    member supporting gravity loads shall not exceed (i) two‐thirds of the deformation that results in loss of ability
    to support gravity loads, and (ii) two‐thirds of the deformation at which the member strength has deteriorated
    to less than 70 percent of the peak strength of the component model. The deformation of a member not
    required for gravity load support shall not exceed two‐thirds of the value at which member strength has
    deteriorated to less than 70 percent of the peak strength of the component model.

2.5.13 Earthquake Load Effects and Load Combinations
The seismic load effect, E, shall be determined in accordance with the following:
1.   For use in load combination 5 in Section 2.7.3 or load combination 5 and 6 in Section 2.7.2, E shall be
     determined in accordance with the following equation,
     E = Eh + Ev
2.   For use in load combination 7 in Section 2.7.3 or load combination 8 in Section 2.7.2, E shall be determined
     in accordance with following equation,
     E = Eh − Ev
Where,
     E = total seismic load effect
     Eh = effect of horizontal seismic forces as defined in Sections 2.5.7 or 2.5.9
     Ev = effect of vertical seismic forces as defined in Section 2.5.13.2
2.5.13.1 Horizontal earthquake loading, Eh
The horizontal seismic load effect, Eh, shall be taken as the horizontal load effects of seismic base shear V (Sec
2.5.7 or 2.5.9) or component forces Fc (Sec 2.5.15).
The directions of application of horizontal seismic forces for design shall be those which will produce the most
critical load effects. Earthquake forces act in both principal directions of the building simultaneously. In order to
account for that,

     (a) For structures of Seismic Design Category B, the design horizontal seismic forces are permitted to be
         applied independently in each of two orthogonal directions and orthogonal interaction effects are
         permitted to be neglected

     (b) Structures of Seismic Design Category C and D shall, as a minimum, conform to the requirements of (a)
         for Seismic Design Category B and in addition the requirements of this Section. The structure of Seismic
         Design Category C with plan irregularity type V and Seismic Design Category D shall be designed for
         100% of the horizontal seismic forces in one principal direction combined with 30% of the horizontal
         seismic forces in the orthogonal direction. Possible combinations are:
              “100% in x‐direction 30% in y‐direction” or
              “30% in x‐direction 100% in y‐direction”

         The combination which produces most unfavourable effect for the particular action effect shall be
         considered. This approach may be applied to equivalent static analysis, response spectrum analysis and
         linear time history analysis procedure.

     (c) Where three‐dimensional analysis of a spatial structure model is performed as in 3D time history
         analysis, simultaneous application of accelerations in two directions shall be considered where the
         ground motions shall satisfy the conditions stated in Sections 2.5.10.2 or 2.5.11.2.

effects to obtain design forces etc.
2.5.13.4 Seismic Load Effect Including Overstrength Factor

Where specifically required, conditions requiring overstrength factor, o, applications shall be determined in
accordance with the following,

     equal to Em as determined in accordance with the following equation,
     Em = Emh + Ev
2.   For use in load combination 7 in Section 2.7.3 or load combination 8 in Section 2.7.2, E shall be taken equal
     to Em as determined in accordance with the following equation,
     Em = Emh − Ev
     where
     Em = total seismic load effect including overstrength factor
     Emh = effect of horizontal seismic forces as defined in Sections 2.5.7 or 2.5.9 including structural
            overstrength.
     Ev = effect of vertical seismic forces as defined in Section 2.5.13.2
The horizontal seismic load effect with overstrength factor, Emh, shall be determined in accordance with the
following equation:
     Emh = oEh

Where, o is the system overstrength factor as defined in Table 6.2.19. Like Eh, directional combinations as
defined in Sec. 2.5.13.1.(b) is also applicable for calculating Emh. The value of Emh need not exceed the maximum
force that can develop in the structure or element as determined by a rational, plastic mechanism analysis or
nonlinear response analysis (static or dynamic) utilizing realistic expected values of material strengths.

2.5.13.5 Allowable Stress Increase for Load Combinations with Overstrength

Where allowable stress design methodologies are used with the seismic load effect defined in Section 2.5.13.4
applied in load combinations 5, 6, or 8 of Section 2.7.2, allowable stresses are permitted to be determined using
an allowable stress increase of 1.2. This increase shall not be combined with increases in allowable stresses or
load combination reductions otherwise permitted elsewhere by this standard.

2.5.16 Design For Seismically Isolated Buildings
Buildings that use special seismic isolation systems for protection against earthquakes shall be called seismically
isolated or base isolated buildings. Seismically isolated structure and every portion thereof shall be designed
and constructed in accordance with the requirements of provisions presented in this Section.
2.5.16.1 General requirements for isolation system
The isolation system to be used in seismically isolated structures shall satisfy the following requirements:
(1) Design of isolation system shall consider variations in seismic isolator material properties over the projected
    life of structure including changes due to ageing, contamination, exposure to moisture, loadings,
    temperature, creep, fatigue, etc.
(2) Isolated structures shall resist design wind loads at all levels above the isolation interface. At the isolation
    interface, a wind restraint system shall be provided to limit lateral displacement in the isolation system to a
    value equal to that required between floors of the structure above the isolation interface.
(3) The fire resistance rating for the isolation system shall be consistent with the requirements of columns,
    walls, or other such elements in the same area of the structure.
(4) The isolation system shall be configured to produce a lateral restoring force such that the lateral force at
    the total design displacement is at least 0.025 W greater than the lateral force at 50% of the total design
    displacement.
(5) The isolation system shall not be configured to include a displacement restraint that limits lateral
    displacement due to the maximum considered earthquake to less than the total maximum displacement
    unless it is demonstrated by analysis that such engagement of restraint does not result in unsatisfactory
    performance of the structure.
(6) Each element of the isolation system shall be designed to be stable under the design vertical load when
    subjected to a horizontal displacement equal to the total maximum displacement.
(7) The factor of safety against global structural overturning at the isolation interface shall not be less than 1.0
    for required load combinations. All gravity and seismic loading conditions shall be investigated. Seismic
    forces for overturning calculations shall be based on the maximum considered earthquake and the vertical
    restoring force shall be based on the seismic weight above the isolation interface.
(8) Local uplift of individual units of isolation system is permitted if the resulting deflections do not cause
    overstress or instability of the isolator units or other elements of the structure.
(9) Access for inspection and replacement of all components of the isolation system shall be provided.
(10) The designer of the isolation system shall establish a quality control testing program for isolator units. Each
     isolator unit before installation shall be tested under specified vertical and horizontal loads.
(11) After completion of construction, a design professional shall complete a final series of inspections or
     observations of structure separation areas and components that cross the isolation interface. Such

    inspections and observations shall confirm that existing conditions allow free and unhindered displacement
    of the structure to maximum design levels and that all components that cross the isolation interface as
    installed are able to accommodate the stipulated displacements.
(12) The designer of the isolation system shall establish a periodic monitoring, inspection, and maintenance
     program for such system.
(13) Remodeling, repair, or retrofitting at the isolation interface, including that of components that cross the
     isolation interface, shall be performed under the direction of a design professional experienced in seismic
     isolation systems.

Structural Design


The isolation system, the foundation, and all structural elements below the isolation system shall be designed
and constructed to withstand a minimum lateral force, Vb using all of the appropriate provisions for a non‐
isolated structure. Vb shall be determined in accordance with Eq. 6.2.67 as follows:
                    Vb = kDmasDD                                                                   (6.2.67)
In all cases, Vb shall not be taken less than the maximum force in the isolation system at any displacement up to
and including the design displacement.
          Vertical distribution of lateral forces: The total lateral force shall be distributed over the height of the
structure above the isolation interface in accordance with Eq. 6.2.68 as follows:
                               w x hx
                    F x  Vs                                                                       (6.2.68)

                               i 1
Where:
         Vc = Total seismic lateral design force on elements above the isolation system.
         hi, hs = Height above the base, to Level i or Level x, respectively.
         wi, ws = Portion of W that is located at or assigned to Level i or Level x, respectively.
At each Level x the force, Fs shall be applied over the area of the structure in accordance with the distribution
of mass at the level. Stresses in each structural element shall be determined by applying to an analytical model
the lateral forces, Fs at all levels above the base.
          Storey drift: The storey drift shall be calculated as in Sec 2.5.7.7 except that Cd for the isolated
structure shall be taken equal to R I and importance factor equal to 1.0. The maximum storey drift of the
structure above the isolation system shall not exceed 0.015hsx.
2.5.16.3 Dynamic analysis
Response spectrum analysis may be conducted if the behavior of the isolation system can be considered as
equivalent linear. Otherwise, non‐linear time history analysis shall be used where the true non‐linear behaviour
of the isolation system can be modeled. The mathematical models of the isolated structure including the
isolation system shall be along guidelines given in Sections 2.5.9.1 and 2.5.11.1, and other requirements given in
Sec 2.5.16.
The isolation system shall be modeled using deformational characteristics developed and verified by testing.
The structure model shall account for: (i) spatial distribution of isolator units; (ii) consideration of translation in
both horizontal directions, and torsion of the structure above the isolation interface considering the most
disadvantageous location of eccentric mass; (iii) overturning/uplift forces on individual isolator units; and (iv)
effects of vertical load, bilateral load, and the rate of loading if the force‐deflection properties of the isolation
system are dependent on such attributes.
A linear elastic model of the isolated structure (above isolation system) may be used provided that: (i) stiffness
properties assumed for the nonlinear components of the isolation system are based on the maximum effective
stiffness of the isolation system, and (ii) all elements of the seismic‐force‐resisting system of the structure
above the isolation system behave linearly.
           Response Spectrum Analysis: Response spectrum analysis shall be performed using a modal damping
value for the fundamental mode in the direction of interest not greater than the effective damping of the
isolation system or 30 percent of critical, whichever is less. Modal damping values for higher modes shall be
selected consistent with those that would be appropriate for response spectrum analysis of the structure above
the isolation system assuming a fixed base.
Response spectrum analysis used to determine the total design displacement and the total maximum
displacement shall include simultaneous excitation of the model by 100 percent of the ground motion in the
critical direction and 30 percent of the ground motion in the perpendicular, horizontal direction. The design

basis earthquake shall be used for the design displacement, while the maximum considered earthquake shall be
used for the maximum displacement. The maximum displacement of the isolation system shall be calculated as
the vectorial sum of the two orthogonal displacements.
For the design displacement, structures that do not require site‐specific ground motion evaluation, shall be
analyzed using the design acceleration response spectrum in accordance with Sec 2.5.4.3. The maximum design
spectrum to be used for the maximum considered earthquake shall not be less than 1.5 times the design
acceleration response spectrum.
The response spectrum procedure is based on an equivalent linear model, where the effective stiffness and
effective damping is a function of the displacement, this formulation is thus an iterative process. The effective
stiffness must be estimated, based on assumed displacement, and then adjusted till obtained displacement
agree with assumed displacement.

The design shear at any story shall not be less than the story shear resulting from application of the story forces
calculated using Eq. 6.2.68 with a value of Vc equal to the base shear obtained from the response spectrum
analysis in the direction of interest.

          Nonlinear Time History Analysis: Where a time history analysis procedure is performed, not fewer
than three appropriate ground motions shall be used in the analysis as described below.
Ground motions shall consist of pairs of appropriate horizontal ground motion acceleration components that
shall be selected and scaled from individual recorded events. Appropriate ground motions shall be selected
from events having magnitudes, fault distance, and source mechanisms that are consistent with those that
control the maximum considered earthquake. If required number of recorded ground motion pairs are not
available, appropriate simulated ground motion pairs shall be used to make up the total number required. For
each pair of horizontal ground‐motion components, a square root of the sum of the squares (SRSS) spectrum
shall be constructed by taking the SRSS of the 5 percent damped response spectra for the scaled components
(where an identical scale factor is applied to both components of a pair). Each pair of motions shall be scaled
such that for each period between 0.5TD and 1.25TM (where TD and TM are defined in Sec 2.5.16.2.1) the average
of the SRSS spectra from all horizontal component pairs does not fall below 1.3 times the corresponding
ordinate of the design response spectrum (Sec 2.5.16.4), by more than 10 percent.
Each pair of ground motion components shall be applied simultaneously to the model considering the most
disadvantageous location of eccentric mass. The maximum displacement of the isolation system shall be
calculated from the vectorial sum of the two orthogonal displacements at each time step.
The parameters of interest shall be calculated for each ground motion used for the time history analysis. If at
least seven ground motions are used for the time history analysis, the average value of the response parameter
of interest is permitted to be used for design. If fewer than seven ground motions are analyzed, the maximum
value of the response parameter of interest shall be used for design.
          Storey drift: Maximum story drift corresponding to the design lateral force including displacement
due to vertical deformation of the isolation system shall not exceed the following limits:
    1. The maximum story drift of the structure above the isolation system calculated by response spectrum
    analysis shall not exceed 0.015hcs.
    2. The maximum story drift of the structure above the isolation system calculated by nonlinear time history
    analysis shall not exceed 0.020hcs.
The storey drift shall be calculated as in Sec 2.5.7.7 except that Cd for the isolated structure shall be taken equal
to RI and importance factor equal to 1.0.
2.5.16.4 Testing
The deformation characteristics and damping values of the isolation system used in the design and analysis of
seismically isolated structures shall be based on test results of isolator units. The tests are for establishing and

validating the design properties of the isolation system and shall not be considered as satisfying the
manufacturing quality control tests.
The following sequence of tests shall be performed on isolator units for the prescribed number of cycles at a
vertical load equal to the average dead load plus one‐half the effects due to live load on all isolator units of a
common type and size:
    (1) Twenty fully reversed cycles of loading at a lateral force corresponding to the wind design force.
    (2) Three fully reversed cycles of loading at each of the following increments of the total design
        displacement‐0.25DD, 0.5DD, 1.0DD, and 1.0DM where DD and DM are as determined in Sec 2.5.16.2.1.
    (3) Three fully reversed cycles of loading at the total maximum displacement, 1.0DTM.
    (4) Not less than ten fully reversed cycles of loading at 1.0 times the total design displacement, 1.0DTD.
For each cycle of each test, the force‐deflection and hysteretic behavior of each isolator unit shall be recorded.
The effective stiffness is obtained as the secant value of stiffness at design displacement while the effective
damping is determined from the area of hysteretic loop at the design displacement.
2.5.16.5 Design review
A design review of the isolation system and related test programs shall be performed by an independent team
of design professionals experienced in seismic analysis methods and the application of seismic isolation.
Isolation system design review shall include, but need not be limited to, the following:
    (1) Review of site‐specific seismic criteria including the development of site‐specific spectra and ground
        motion time histories and all other design criteria developed specifically for the project;
    (2) Review of the preliminary design including the determination of the total design displacement of the
        isolation system and the lateral force design level;
    (3) Overview and observation of prototype (isolator unit) testing
    (4) Review of the final design of the entire structural system and all supporting analyses; and
    (5) Review of the isolation system quality control testing program.
2.5.17 Buildings with Soft Storey

Buildings with possible soft storey action at ground level for providing open parking spaces belong to structures
with major vertical irregularity [Figure 6.2.28(a)]. Special arrangement is needed to increase the lateral strength
and stiffness of the soft/open storey. The following two approaches may be considered:
    (1) Dynamic analysis of such building may be carried out incorporating the strength and stiffness of infill
        walls and inelastic deformations in the members, particularly those in the soft storey, and the members
        designed accordingly.

    (2) Alternatively, when system overstrength factor, o, is not included in determining seismic load effects,
        the following design criteria are to be adopted after carrying out the earthquake analysis, neglecting the
        effect of infill walls in other storeys. Structural elements (e.g columns and beams) of the soft storey are
        to be designed for 2.5 times the storey shears and moments calculated under seismic loads neglecting
        effect of infill walls. Shear walls placed symmetrically in both directions of the building as far away from
        the centre of the building as feasible are to be designed exclusively for 1.5 times the lateral shear force
        calculated before.
2.5.18 Non‐Building Structures

Calculation of seismic design forces on non‐building structures (e.g. chimney, self‐supported overhead
water/fluid tank, silo, trussed tower, storage tank, cooling tower, monument and other structures not covered
in Sec 2.5) shall be in accordance with "Chapter 15: Seismic Design Requirements for Non‐Building Structures,
Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures, ASCE Standard ASCE/SEI 7‐05" complying with the
requirements of Sec 2.5 of this Code.
