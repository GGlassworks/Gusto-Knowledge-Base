This standard was developed by a consensus standards development
process which has been accredited by the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI). Accreditation by ANSI, a voluntary accreditation
body representing public and private sector standards development
organizations in the U.S. and abroad, signiﬁes that the standards devel-
opment process used by ASCE has met the ANSI requirements for
openness, balance, consensus, and due process.

While ASCE’s process is designed to promote standards that reﬂect a
fair and reasoned consensus among all interested participants, while
preserving the public health, safety, and welfare that is paramount to
its mission, it has not made an independent assessment of and does
not warrant the accuracy, completeness, suitability, or utility of any
information, apparatus, product, or process discussed herein. ASCE
does not intend, nor should anyone interpret, ASCE’s standards to
replace the sound judgment of a competent professional, having
knowledge and experience in the appropriate ﬁeld(s) of practice, nor
to substitute for the standard of care required of such professionals in
interpreting and applying the contents of this standard.

ASCE has no authority to enforce compliance with its standards and
does not undertake to certify products for compliance or to render
any professional services to any person or entity.

ASCE disclaims any and all liability for any personal injury, property
damage, ﬁnancial loss or other damages of any nature whatsoever,
including without limitation any direct, indirect, special, exemplary,
or consequential damages, resulting from any person’s use of, or
reliance on, this standard. Any individual who relies on this standard
assumes full responsibility for such use.

                                   DEDICATION




                                  Thomas R. Tyson, P.E., S.E.



The members of the Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures Standards
Committee of the Structural Engineering Institute respectfully dedicate this Standard in the
memory of Thomas R. Tyson, P.E., S.E., who passed away on December 19, 2009.
     His structural engineering expertise complemented his dedication to our profession, and these
qualities guided the members of the Live Load Subcommittee, which he chaired during the prepara-
tion of this Standard. His practical advice, quick smile, and good nature will be greatly missed.




                                                                                                     xiii

produce the maximum load effects on the structural elements under consideration. The concentrated load need not be assumed to act concurrently
with other uniform or concentrated live loads.
h
  The loading applies to stack room ﬂoors that support nonmobile, double-faced library book stacks subject to the following limitations: (1) The
nominal book stack unit height shall not exceed 90 in. (2,290 mm); (2) the nominal shelf depth shall not exceed 12 in. (305 mm) for each face;
and (3) parallel rows of double-faced book stacks shall be separated by aisles not less than 36 in. (914 mm) wide.
k
  In addition to the vertical live loads, the design shall include horizontal swaying forces applied to each row of the seats as follows: 24 lb per
linear ft of seat applied in a direction parallel to each row of seats and 10 lb per linear ft of seat applied in a direction perpendicular to each row
of seats. The parallel and perpendicular horizontal swaying forces need not be applied simultaneously.
l
  Uninhabitable attic areas without storage are those where the maximum clear height between the joist and rafter is less than 42 in. (1,067 mm),
or where there are not two or more adjacent trusses with web conﬁgurations capable of accommodating an assumed rectangle 42 in. (1,067 mm)
in height by 24 in. (610 mm) in width, or greater, within the plane of the trusses. This live load need not be assumed to act concurrently with
any other live load requirement.
m
   Uninhabitable attic areas with storage are those where the maximum clear height between the joist and rafter is 42 in. (1,067 mm) or greater, or
where there are two or more adjacent trusses with web conﬁgurations capable of accommodating an assumed rectangle 42 in. (1,067 mm) in
height by 24 in. (610 mm) in width, or greater, within the plane of the trusses. At the trusses, the live load need only be applied to those portions
of the bottom chords where both of the following conditions are met:
    i. The attic area is accessible from an opening not less than 20 in. (508 mm) in width by 30 in. (762 mm) in length that is located where the
        clear height in the attic is a minimum of 30 in. (762 mm); and
    ii. The slope of the truss bottom chord is no greater than 2 units vertical to 12 units horizontal (9.5% slope).
    The remaining portions of the bottom chords shall be designed for a uniformly distributed nonconcurrent live load of not less than 10 lb/ft2
(0.48 kN/m2).
n
  Where uniform roof live loads are reduced to less than 20 lb/ft2 (0.96 kN/m2) in accordance with Section 4.8.1 and are applied to the design of
structural members arranged so as to create continuity, the reduced roof live load shall be applied to adjacent spans or to alternate spans,
whichever produces the greatest unfavorable load effect.
o
  Roofs used for other occupancies shall be designed for appropriate loads as approved by the authority having jurisdiction.
p
  Other uniform loads in accordance with an approved method, which contains provisions for truck loadings, shall also be considered where appropriate.
q
  The concentrated wheel load shall be applied on an area of 4.5 in. by 4.5 in. (114 mm by 114 mm).
r
  Minimum concentrated load on stair treads (on area of 2 in. by 2 in. [50 mm by 50 mm]) is to be applied nonconcurrent with the uniform load.

afforded by terrain, higher structures, or trees. Roofs that contain several large pieces of mechanical equipment, parapets that extend above the
height of the balanced snow load (hb), or other obstructions are not in this category. Sheltered: Roofs located tight in among conifers that qualify
as obstructions.

  Obstructions within a distance of 10ho provide “shelter,” where ho is the height of the obstruction above the roof level. If the only obstructions
are a few deciduous trees that are leaﬂess in winter, the “fully exposed” category shall be used. Note that these are heights above the roof.
Heights used to establish the Exposure Category in Section 26.7 are heights above the ground.
