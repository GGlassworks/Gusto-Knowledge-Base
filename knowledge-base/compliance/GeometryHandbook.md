Some Thoughts About …
Line Segments
        Line segments are generally named by their endpoints, so the
         segment at right could be named either 𝐴𝐵 or 𝐵𝐴.
        Segment 𝐴𝐵 contains the two endpoints (A and B) and all points on line ⃖𝐴𝐵⃗ that are
         between them.
        Congruent segments are segments of equal length.
        A bisector splits a segment into two congruent (equal length) segments.

Rays
        Rays are generally named by their single endpoint,
         called an initial point, and another point on the ray.
        Ray 𝐴𝐵⃗ contains its initial point A and all points on line
         ⃖ ⃗ in the direction of the arrow.
         𝐴𝐵
        Rays 𝐴𝐵⃗ and 𝐵𝐴⃗ are not the same ray.
        If point O is on line ⃖𝐴𝐵⃗ and is between points A and B,
         then rays 𝑂𝐴⃗ and 𝑂𝐵⃗ are called opposite rays. They
                                                                     ⃖ ⃗.
         have only point O in common, and together they make up line 𝐴𝐵
Lines
        Lines are generally named by either a single script letter
         (e.g., l) or by two points on the line (e.g.,. 𝐴𝐵
                                                        ⃖ ⃗).
        A line extends infinitely in the directions shown by its
         arrows.
        Lines are parallel if they are in the same plane and they
         never intersect. Lines f and g, at right, are parallel.
        Lines are perpendicular if they intersect at a 90⁰ angle. A
         pair of perpendicular lines is always in the same plane. Lines
         f and e, at right, are perpendicular. Lines g and e are also
         perpendicular.
        Lines are skew if they are not in the same plane and they
         never intersect. Lines k and l, at right, are skew.

                                   Distance Between Points

Distance measures how far apart two things are. The distance between two points can be
measured in any number of dimensions, and is defined as the length of the line connecting the
two points. Distance is always a positive number.

1-Dimension (line segment)

Distance - In one dimension, the distance between two points is determined simply by
subtracting the coordinates of the points. If the endpoints are labeled, say A and B, then the
length of segment AB is shown as AB.

Example 1.1: In this segment, the length of AB, i.e., AB, is calculated as: 5          2     𝟕.
                                     A                       B


Midpoint – the point equidistant from each end of a line segment. That is, the midpoint is
halfway from one end of the segment to the other. To obtain the value of the midpoint, add
the two end values and divide the result by 2.
                                                                                  𝟑
Example 1.2: The midpoint of segment AB in Example 1.1 is:                         .
                                                                                  𝟐


Distances Between Collinear Points

Recall that collinear points are points on the same line.
A common problem in geometry is to split a line segment into parts based on some knowledge
about the one or more of the parts.

Example 1.3: Find two possible lengths for CD if C, D, and E are collinear, and CE         15.8 cm
and DE 3.5 cm.
   It is helpful to use a line diagram when dealing with midpoint problems. There are two
   possible line diagrams for this problem: 1) D is between C and E, 2) E is between C and D.
   In these diagrams, we show distances instead of point values:
                         Case 1                                        Case 2

Chapter 1                                                                                    Basic Geometry

2-Dimensions

Distance – In two dimensions, the distance between two points can be calculated by
considering the line between them to be the hypotenuse of a right triangle. To determine the
length of this line:
        Calculate the difference in the 𝑥-coordinates of the points
        Calculate the difference in the 𝑦-coordinates of the points
        Use the Pythagorean Theorem.

This process is illustrated below, using the variable “d” for distance.

                     Example 1.4: Find the distance between (-1,1) and (2,5). Based on the
                     illustration to the left:
                     x‐coordinate difference: 2                  1        3.
                     y‐coordinate difference: 5              1       4.

Then, the distance is calculated using the formula: d                      3    4   9   16    25
We get d          25, so d    √25       𝟓

If we define two points generally as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), then the 2-dimensional distance
formula would be:
                         distance           x    x           y        y    .


Midpoint – To obtain the value of the midpoint in two or more dimensions, add the
corresponding coordinates of the endpoints and divide each result by 2.
If you are given the value of the midpoint and asked for the coordinates of an endpoint, you
may choose to calculate a vector, which in this case is simply the difference between two
points.

Example 1.5: Find the distance between P                2, 3 and Q 3, 15 .

   The formula for the distance between points is: d                       𝑥    𝑥   𝑦    𝑦
   Let point 1 be P      2, 3 , and let point 2 be Q 3, 15 . Then,

   d          3      2        15    3           √5      12       √169          𝟏𝟑

   Note that 5-12-13 is a Pythagorean Triple.

   It is helpful to use a line diagram when dealing with midpoint problems. Label the endpoints
   and midpoint, and identify the coordinates of each:



   The difference between points 𝐀 and M can be expressed in two dimensions as a vector
   using “〈 〉” instead of “ ”. Let’s find the difference (note: “difference” implies subtraction).
              1, 2    Point 𝐌
              3, 3    Point 𝐀
        〈 2,     5〉   Difference vector (difference between the two points)
   The difference vector can then be applied to the midpoint to get the coordinates of point 𝐃.
   If I can get from A to M by moving 〈 2, 5〉, then I can get from M to D by moving 〈 2, 5〉.
            1, 2      Point 𝐌
          〈 2, 5〉     Difference vector
               𝟏, 7   Point D. Therefore, we conclude that 𝒙             𝟏.
   Note that the 𝑦-value of point 𝐃 in the solution, 7, matches the 𝑦-value of point 𝐃 in the
   statement of the problem.



Example 1.7: Find the value of 𝑦 if AC    3𝑦    5, CB       4𝑦   1, AB        9𝑦   12, and C lies
between A and B.
The line diagram is crucial for this problem. It must be drawn with A and B as endpoints and C
between them.




   Based on the diagram, we have: 3𝑦        5      4𝑦       1    9𝑦   12

Partial Distances and Distance Equations
In order to find a distance part-way between two points, we need to interpolate between the
beginning and end points. We must calculate the portion of the distance covered at the desired
time, and then interpolate between the start and end points.
Let 𝑘 be the factor, representing the portion of the total distance that is of interest to us. 𝑘 is
usually given in terms of time, e.g., after 3 hours of a 10-hour journey. In general,
          elapsed time
   𝑘                   .
            total time
The formula for the interpolation, then, is:
   desired point      𝑘 ∙ ending point         1    𝑘 ∙ starting point
This interpolation formula works for any number of dimensions, taking each coordinate
separately.


Example 1.8: A boat begins a journey at location 2, 5 on a grid and heads directly for point
 10, 15 on the same grid. It is estimated that the trip will take 10 hours if the boat travels in a
straight line. At what point of the grid is the boat after 3 hours?
   Start at: 2, 5
   End at: 10, 15
   3 hours → 𝑘             0.3 of the 10 hour period.
             This is the factor for the endpoint: 10, 15 .
             The staring point, 2, 5 gets a factor of 1        0.3   0.7. The factors must always add
              to 1.
   Ordered pair @ 𝑡        3 hours is: 2, 5 ∙ 0.7      10, 15 ∙ 0.3      𝟒. 𝟒, 𝟖. 𝟎

   Note: an alternative method would be to develop separate equations for the 𝑥-variable and
   𝑦-variable in terms of time, the 𝑡-variable. These are called parametric equations, and 𝑡 is
   the parameter in the equations. For this problem, the parametric equations would be:
                                                        𝑡
       variable start        end start ∙

                             10
   Note that the 10 in the denominator of these equations is the length of time, in hours,
   separating the starting point and the ending point.
   Solve for the required ordered pair by substituting 𝑡          3 into these equations.

                                   Distance Formula in “n” Dimensions

The distance between two points can be generalized to “n” dimensions by successive use of the
Pythagorean Theorem in multiple dimensions. To move from two dimensions to three
dimensions, we start with the two-dimensional formula and apply the Pythagorean Theorem to
add the third dimension.

3 Dimensions

Consider two 3-dimensional points (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2). Consider first the situation where
the two z-coordinates are the same. Then, the distance between the points is 2-dimensional,
i.e., d        𝑥     𝑥             𝑦       𝑦       .

We then add a third dimension using the Pythagorean Theorem:

          distance       d         z       z

          distance             x       x               y        y                z           z
          distance       x         x           y           y             z       z

And, finally the 3-dimensional difference formula:

                             distance              x           x             y       y               z       z


n Dimensions

Using the same methodology in “n” dimensions, we get the generalized n-dimensional
difference formula (where there are n terms beneath the radical, one for each dimension):

              distance             x       x               y        y            z           z           ⋯       w   w

Or, in higher level mathematical notation:
The distance between two points A       a ,a ,… ,a                               and 𝐵               b ,b ,… ,b      is

                                               Angles


Parts of an Angle
An angle consists of two rays with a common
endpoint (or, initial point).
        Each ray is a side of the angle.
        The common endpoint is called the vertex of
         the angle.

Naming Angles
Angles can be named in one of two ways:
        Point-vertex-point method. In this method, the angle is named from a point on one ray,
         the vertex, and a point on the other ray. This is the most unambiguous method of
         naming an angle, and is useful in diagrams with multiple angles sharing the same vertex.
         In the above figure, the angle shown could be named ∠BAC or ∠CAB.
        Vertex method. In cases where it is not ambiguous, an angle can be named based solely
         on its vertex. In the above figure, the angle could be named ∠A.

Measure of an Angle
There are two conventions for measuring the size of an angle:
        In degrees. The symbol for degrees is ⁰. There are 360⁰ in a full circle. The angle above
         measures approximately 360      8 45⁰ (one-eighth of a circle).
        In radians. There are 2𝜋 radians in a complete circle. The angle above measures

         approximately             radians.


Some Terms Relating to Angles
Angle interior is the area between the rays.
Angle exterior is the area not between the rays.
Adjacent angles are angles that share a ray for a side. ∠BAD and
∠DAC in the figure at right are adjacent angles.
Congruent angles are angles with the same measure.
Angle bisector is a ray that divides the angle into two congruent
angles. Ray AD⃗ bisects ∠BAC in the figure at right.

                                                                                             TRUE
        The Contrapositive statement is always true when the original
         statement is true and false when the original statement is false.

Note also that:
    When two statements must be either both true or both false, they are called equivalent
       statements.
            o The original statement and the contrapositive are equivalent statements.
            o The converse and the inverse are equivalent statements.
    If both the original statement and the converse are true, the phrase “if and only if”
       (abbreviated “iff”) may be used. For example, “A number is divisible by 3 iff the sum of
       its digits is divisible by 3.”

                              Inductive vs. Deductive Reasoning


Inductive Reasoning
Inductive reasoning uses observation to form a hypothesis or conjecture. The hypothesis can
then be tested to see if it is true. The test must be performed in order to confirm the
hypothesis.

Example: Observe that the sum of the numbers 1 to 4 is 4 ∙ 5/2 and that the sum of the
numbers 1 to 5 is 5 ∙ 6/2 . Hypothesis: the sum of the first n numbers is 𝑛 ∗ 𝑛 1 /2 .
Testing this hypothesis confirms that it is true.


Deductive Reasoning
Deductive reasoning argues that if something is true about a broad category of things, it is true
of an item in the category.

         Example: All birds have beaks. A pigeon is a bird; therefore, it has a beak.

There are two key types of deductive reasoning of which the student should be aware:

        Law of Detachment. Given that 𝒑 → 𝒒, if p is true then q is true. In words, if one thing
         implies another, then whenever the first thing is true, the second must also be true.
         Example 2.1: Start with the statement: “If a living creature is human, then it has a
         brain.” Then because you are human, we can conclude that you have a brain.

        Syllogism. Given that 𝒑 → 𝒒 and 𝒒 → 𝒓, we can conclude that 𝒑 → 𝒓. This is a kind of
         transitive property of logic. In words, if one thing implies a second and that second
         thing implies a third, then the first thing implies the third.
         Example 2.2: Start with the statements: “If my pencil breaks, I will not be able to
         write,” and “if I am not able to write, I will not pass my test.” Then I can conclude that
         “If my pencil breaks, I will not pass my test.”

                                    An Approach to Proofs

Learning to develop a successful proof is one of the key skills students develop in geometry.
The process is different from anything students have encountered in previous math classes, and
may seem difficult at first. Diligence and practice in solving proofs will help students develop
reasoning skills that will serve them well for the rest of their lives.

Requirements in Performing Proofs
        Each proof starts with a set of “givens,” statements that you are supplied and from
         which you must derive a “conclusion.” Your mission is to start with the givens and to
         proceed logically to the conclusion, providing reasons for each step along the way.
        Each step in a proof builds on what has been developed before. Initially, you look at
         what you can conclude from the” givens.” Then as you proceed through the steps in the
         proof, you are able to use additional things you have concluded based on earlier steps.
        Each step in a proof must have a valid reason associated with it. So, each statement in
         the proof must be furnished with an answer to the question: “Why is this step valid?”

Tips for Successful Proof Development
        At each step, think about what you know and what you can conclude from that
         information. Do this initially without regard to what you are being asked to prove. Then
         look at each thing you can conclude and see which ones move you closer to what you
         are trying to prove.
        Go as far as you can into the proof from the beginning. If you get stuck, …
        Work backwards from the end of the proof. Ask yourself what the last step in the proof
         is likely to be. For example, if you are asked to prove that two triangles are congruent,
         try to see which of the several theorems about this is most likely to be useful based on
         what you were given and what you have been able to prove so far.
        Continue working backwards until you see steps that can be added to the front end of
         the proof. You may find yourself alternating between the front end and the back end
         until you finally bridge the gap between the two sections of the proof.
        Don’t skip any steps. Some things appear obvious, but actually have a mathematical
         reason for being true. For example, 𝑎 𝑎 might seem obvious, but “obvious” is not a
         valid reason in a geometry proof. The reason for 𝑎 𝑎 is a property of algebra called
         the “reflexive property of equality.” Use mathematical reasons for all your steps.

Corresponding Angles
Corresponding Angles are angles in the same location relative to the parallel lines and the
transversal. For example, the angles on top of the parallel lines and left of the transversal (i.e.,
top left) are corresponding angles.

Angles A and E (top left) are Corresponding Angles. So are angle pairs B and F (top right), C
and G (bottom left), and D and H (bottom right). Corresponding angles are congruent.


Alternate Interior Angles
Angles D and E are Alternate Interior Angles. Angles C and F are also alternate interior angles.
Alternate interior angles are congruent.


Alternate Exterior Angles
Angles A and H are Alternate Exterior Angles. Angles B and G are also alternate exterior
angles. Alternate exterior angles are congruent.


Consecutive Interior Angles
Angles C and E are Consecutive Interior Angles. Angles D and F are also consecutive interior
angles. Consecutive interior angles are supplementary.


Note that angles A, D, E, and H are congruent, and angles B, C, F, and G are congruent. In
addition, each of the angles in the first group are supplementary to each of the angles in the
second group.

Two Transversals
Sometimes, the student is presented two sets of intersecting parallel lines, as shown above.
Note that each pair of parallel lines is a set of transversals to the other set of parallel lines.



               A       B                               I        J

                   C       D                               K        L

In this case, the following groups of angles are congruent:
        Group 1: Angles A, D, E, H, I, L, M and P are all congruent.
        Group 2: Angles B, C, F, G, J, K, N, and O are all congruent.
        Each angle in the Group 1 is supplementary to each angle in Group 2.



Some Examples: In the diagram above (Two Transversals), with two pairs of parallel lines,
what types of angles are identified and what is their relationship to each other?
Example 3.1: ∠𝐷 and ∠𝐼.
     These angles are alternate interior angles; they are congruent.

Example 3.2: ∠𝐶 and ∠𝐽.
     These angles are alternate exterior angles; they are congruent.

                                  Proving Lines are Parallel

The properties of parallel lines cut by a transversal can be used to prove two lines are parallel.


Corresponding Angles
If two lines cut by a transversal have congruent corresponding angles,
then the lines are parallel. Note that there are 4 sets of corresponding
angles.



                         Alternate Interior Angles
                         If two lines cut by a transversal have congruent alternate interior angles
                         congruent, then the lines are parallel. Note that there are 2 sets of
                         alternate interior angles.



Alternate Exterior Angles
If two lines cut by a transversal have congruent alternate exterior
angles, then the lines are parallel. Note that there are 2 sets of
alternate exterior angles.



                         Consecutive Interior Angles
                         If two lines cut by a transversal have supplementary consecutive
                         interior angles, then the lines are parallel. Note that there are 2 sets of
                         consecutive interior angles.

                 Parallel and Perpendicular Lines in the Coordinate Plane


Parallel Lines
Two lines are parallel if their slopes are equal.
        In 𝑦 𝑚𝑥        𝑏 form, if the values of 𝑚 are
         the same.
              Example 3.6: 𝑦      2𝑥       3       and
                           𝑦      2𝑥       1
        In Standard Form, if the coefficients of 𝑥 and
         𝑦 are proportional between the equations.
              Example 3.7: 3𝑥      2𝑦      5        and
                           6𝑥      4𝑦          7
        Also, if the lines are both vertical (i.e., their
         slopes are undefined).
              Example 3.8: 𝑥       3       and
                           𝑥      2


Perpendicular Lines
Two lines are perpendicular if the product of their
slopes is 𝟏. That is, if the slopes have different
signs and are multiplicative inverses.
        In 𝑦 𝑚𝑥 𝑏 form, the values of 𝑚
         multiply to get 1..
              Example 3.9: 𝑦      6𝑥       5       and
                            𝑦          𝑥       3

        In Standard Form, if you add the product of
         the x-coefficients to the product of the y-
         coefficients and get zero.
              Example 3.10: 4𝑥      6𝑦         4 and
                            3𝑥      2𝑦         5 because          4∙3   6∙     2      0

        Also, if one line is vertical (i.e., 𝑚 is undefined) and one line is horizontal (i.e., 𝑚      0).

Example 3.13: Write an equation of the line that can be used to calculate the distance between
   4, 3 and the line 𝑦                     𝑥     9.

   The distance between a point and a line is the length of the
   segment connecting the point to the line at a right angle.
   See the diagram to the right.
   So, this question is asking for the equation of the line
   perpendicular to 𝑦                  𝑥       9 that contains the point
       4, 3 , but is not asking us to calculate the distance.
   The perpendicular line will have a slope that is the opposite

         𝒚        𝒙        𝟒       𝟑

   Note: If we were asked to calculate the distance between Point A and the line 𝑦                         𝑥
   9, we would first need to find Point B at the intersection of the two lines shown, and then
   measure the distance between the two points using the distance formula.

                                      Proportional Segments


Parallel Line in a Triangle
A line is parallel to one side of a triangle iff it divides the other two sides proportionately.
This if-and-only-if statement breaks down into the following two statements:
        If a line (or ray or segment) is parallel to one side of a triangle, then
         it divides the other two sides proportionately.
        If a line (or ray or segment) divides two sides of a triangle
         proportionately, then it is parallel to the third side.
In the diagram to the right, we see that 𝐴𝐵 ∥ 𝐸𝐷. We can conclude that:

                and                as well as a number of other equivalent proportion equalities.

Conversely, if we knew one of the proportions above, but were not given that the segments
were parallel, we could conclude that 𝐴𝐵 ∥ 𝐸𝐷 because of the equal proportions.


Example 3.14: Determine whether 𝐴𝐵 ∥ 𝐸𝐷 in the diagram to the right.

   Let’s check the proportions. Is                 ?
      𝐶𝐸 12 3            𝐸𝐴 6 3
      𝐶𝐷     8    2      𝐷𝐵 4 2
   Since the proportions of the two sides are equal, we can conclude that 𝑨𝑩 ∥ 𝑬𝑫.



Three or More Parallel Lines
Three or more parallel lines divide any transversals proportionately.
In the diagram to the right, we see that the three horizontal lines
(or rays or segments) are parallel. We can conclude that:

              and          .

The converse of this is not true. That is, if three or more lines
divide transversals into proportionate parts, it is not necessarily
true that the lines are parallel.

Example 3.15: Given that the three horizontal lines in the
diagram to the right are parallel, what is the values of 𝑥?
   The three parallel horizontal lines in the diagram divide the
   vertical lines into proportional segments.

Angle Bisector
An angle bisector in a triangle divides the opposite sides into segments that are proportional
to the adjacent sides.
In the diagram to the right, we see that ∠𝐷 is bisected, crea ng
segments 𝐴𝐵 and 𝐵𝐶 opposite ∠𝐷. We can conclude that:

                     and             .

The converse of this is also true. That is, if a line (or ray or segment) through a vertex of a
triangle splits the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides, then,
that line (or ray or segment) bisects the vertex angle. That is, if the above proportions are true,
then 𝐷𝐵 bisects ∠𝐷.


Example 3.16: Find the value of 𝑥 in the diagram.
An angle bisector in a triangle divides the opposite sides into segments
that are proportional to the adjacent sides. So,
   18 𝑥 3
    𝑥   10
   𝑥 𝑥 3   18 ∙ 10
   𝑥          3𝑥    180

     𝑥     12 𝑥         15       0   →   𝑥   12, 15
         If 𝑥       15, we have negative side lengths, so we discard the solution 𝑥       15.
         If 𝑥      12, the sides of ∆𝐵𝐴𝐷 would be 18, 15, 22 , which makes a valid triangle.
   Conclude: 𝒙             𝟏𝟐.

                                   What Makes a Triangle?

Definition – A triangle is a plane figure with three sides and three angles.
    Draw three points that are not on the same line, connect them, and you have a triangle.
        The three points you started with are called vertices.
    Three points determine a plane, so a triangle must have all of its parts on the same
        plane.

Parts of a Triangle
        Vertices – the points where the sides intersect. In
         the diagram to the right, the vertices are the red
         points. Vertices are typically labeled with capital
         letters.
        Legs – the sides of a triangle are also called the
         triangle’s legs. In diagrams, the lengths of the legs are often represented by lower case
         letters corresponding to the angles opposite them.
        Angles (interior angles) – the angles formed at each vertex are the triangle’s angles. In
         the diagram above, the triangle has interior angles ∠𝐴, ∠𝐵, ∠𝐶 indicated by the green
         arcs at the vertices. These angles could be named in various ways, for example:
             o ∠𝐴 ∠𝐵𝐴𝐶 ∠𝐶𝐴𝐵.
             o Naming the angle with a single vertex is acceptable if there is no ambiguity about
                  which angle is being referenced, e.g., ∠𝐴.
             o If any ambiguity exists as to which angle is being referenced, the angle must be
                  named using three points: two of the points must be on the sides enclosing the
                  angle and the vertex must be in the middle, e.g., ∠𝐵𝐴𝐶 or ∠𝐶𝐴𝐵.
             o Alternatively, an angle may be named with a letter or symbol next to its arc.
        Altitudes – line segments from each vertex to the opposite side of the triangle that are
         perpendicular to that opposite side. In the diagram below left, an altitude is labeled h.
        Medians – line segments from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side of the
         triangle. In the diagram below right, a median is labeled m.

Sum of Interior Angles
The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°. If two
of the interior angles in a triangle have known measures,
the measure of the third can be easily calculated. For
example, in the diagram to the right, if 𝑚∠𝐴 and 𝑚∠𝐵
are known, 𝑚∠𝐶 can be calculated as:
   𝑚∠𝐶        180°   𝑚∠𝐴    𝑚∠𝐵.


Third Angle Theorem: If two interior angles in one triangle are congruent to two interior angles
in another triangle, then the third interior angles in the two triangles are congruent.
This follows from the fact that the sum of the three interior angles in each triangle must be
180°.


Example 4.1: Given 𝐴𝐷 ⊥ 𝐵𝐶 , 𝐴𝐷 bisects ∠𝐵𝐴𝐶, prove ∠𝐴𝐵𝐷 ≅ ∠𝐴𝐶𝐷.
   This can be proven in multiple ways. Let’s prove it with the Third Angle
   Theorem.

                                         (they all measure 90°).
        4     ∠𝐵𝐴𝐷 ≅ ∠𝐶𝐴𝐷.               𝐴𝐷 bisects ∠𝐵𝐴𝐶.

                                    Inequalities in Triangles

Angles and their opposite sides in triangles are related. In fact, this is often reflected in the
labeling of angles and sides in triangle illustrations.

                                                       Angles and their opposite sides are often
                                                       labeled with the same letter. An upper case
                                                       letter is used for the angle and a lower case
                                                       letter is used for the side.


The relationship between angles and their opposite sides translates into the following triangle
inequalities:
                        If 𝒎∠𝑪 𝒎∠𝑩 𝒎∠𝑨, then 𝒄 𝑏 𝑎
                            If 𝒎∠𝑪     𝒎∠𝑩       𝒎∠𝑨, then 𝒄          𝒃    𝒂

That is, in any triangle,
 The largest side is opposite the largest angle.
 The medium side is opposite the medium angle.
 The smallest side is opposite the smallest angle.


Other Inequalities in Triangles
Triangle Inequality: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is
greater than the length of the third side. Also, the difference of the lengths
of any two sides is smaller than the length of the third side. If 𝑎 𝑏:
         𝒂    𝒃   𝒄   𝒂     𝒃 and similar for the other sides.

Exterior Angle Inequality: The measure of an external angle is greater than the measure of
either of the two non-adjacent interior angles. That is, in the figure below:
         𝒎∠𝑫𝑨𝑩        𝑚∠𝑩     and    𝒎∠𝑫𝑨𝑩        𝑚∠𝐶.

Exterior Angle Equality: The measure of an external
angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two
non-adjacent interior angles. That is, in the figure to the right:
         𝒎∠𝑫𝑨𝑩        𝒎∠𝑩     𝒎∠𝑪.

Note: the Exterior Angle Equality is typically more useful than the Exterior Angle Inequality.

Sides of a Triangle
The lengths of the sides of a triangle are limited: given the lengths of any two sides, the length
of the third side must be greater than their difference and less than their sum. That is, if the
sides of a triangle have lengths 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐, and you know the values of, for example, 𝑎 and 𝑏
with 𝑎 the larger of the two, then:
         𝑎    𝑏   𝑐       𝑎    𝑏

Example 4.2: If a triangle has two sides with lengths 13 and 8, what are the possible lengths of
the third side?
   If we let 𝑐 represent the length of the third side of a triangle, with 𝑎 13, 𝑏 8, then:
        𝑐 must be greater than the difference of 𝑎 and 𝑏: 𝑐 13 8 → 𝑐 5.
        𝑐 must be less than the sum of 𝑎 and 𝑏: 𝑐 13 8 → 𝑐 21.
   If we put all of this together in a single inequality, we get:
         13   8       𝑐   13       8
         𝟓    𝒄   𝟐𝟏

Also, as indicated above, there are limits to the lengths of sides if the measures of the interior
angles of the triangle are known. In particular,
     The longest side of a triangle is opposite the largest
        interior angle.
     The shortest side of a triangle is opposite the smallest
        interior angle.
In general, if we know that 𝑚∠𝐶        𝑚∠𝐵      𝑚∠𝐴, then we know that 𝑐       𝑏    𝑎.


Example 4.3: Identify the longest segment in the diagram shown.
   Let’s see what we know in each of the triangles. Note that:
        The sum of the angles in each triangle must be 180° and
        Sides across from larger angles in the same triangle are larger.

   In ∆𝐴𝐵𝐶:                            In ∆𝐴𝐷𝐸:
                                                                      In ∆𝐴𝐶𝐷:
        𝑚∠𝐵𝐴𝐶 43°                          𝑚∠𝐸𝐴𝐷 38°
        𝐴𝐵 𝐵𝐶 𝐴𝐶                           𝐷𝐸 𝐴𝐸 𝐴𝐷                      𝐶𝐷       𝐴𝐶      𝐴𝐷

   Therefore, the two candidates for longest segment are 𝐴𝐶 and 𝐴𝐷. Looking closer at the
   above inequalities, we notice that in ∆𝐴𝐶𝐷, we have 𝐴𝐶 𝐴𝐷. Therefore, the longest
   segment is: 𝑨𝑫.

The discussion above addresses angles within a single triangle. There is another relationship
that allows us to compare the lengths of sides in two different triangles. In particular,
         If two triangles have two pairs of congruent sides, consider the angles between the
         congruent sides. The triangle with the larger of these angles has the larger side
         opposite that angle. This is illustrated in the next example.


Example 4.4: Find the range of values for 𝑥.
   Note: never trust the relative sizes of angles and sides in a diagram. For example, the two
   sides with length 9 in this diagram are drawn with different lengths!
   We know two things involving 𝑥:
             The side labeled 3𝑥   4 must be positive. So, 3𝑥      4   0.
             The two angles shown (39°) and (41°) share two congruent sides
              (one side with length 9 and one side of unknown length that is
              shared by the two angles). Therefore, the side opposite the
              smaller angle must be smaller than the side opposite the larger
              angle. So, 3𝑥 4 17.
   Combining these two inequalities into a single compound inequality, and solving:
         Starting inequality:          0    3𝑥    4        17
         Add 4:                        4    3𝑥        21

Example 4.5: Given ∆ABC with A         3, 4 , B 7, 1 , C 2, 1 , and median AD, find the
coordinates of point D.
   Many times, you need to draw the situation for a given problem. This is not one of those
   times.
   Point D is the midpoint of the side of the triangle opposite the given vertex.
   In this problem, Point A is the vertex in question (it is on the median 𝐴𝐷). So, Point D is the
   midpoint of the points B 7, 1 and C 2, 1 .
   So, the coordinates of Point D are:     7, 1        2, 1     2   𝟒. 𝟓, 𝟎

Example 4.6: Given ∆ABC with A 2,5 , B 3,5 , C 6, 1 , and
altitude CD, find the coordinates of point D.
An altitude of a triangle is a line segment drawn from a vertex
to a point on the opposite side (extended, if necessary) that is
perpendicular to that side.
   This problem is very straightforward once you graph it. To find the base point of the
   altitude, we can look at the intersection of the two lines on which Point D lies.
   Line containing 𝐵𝐴: 𝑦        5
   Line containing 𝐶𝐷 . 𝑥       6 is perpendicular to 𝑦       5 and contains C 6, 1 .
   Therefore, Point D has coordinates: 𝟔, 𝟓 .




Example 4.7: Write and solve an inequality for 𝑥.
   Each side must have a positive measure, so: 𝑥         2    0
                                                         𝑥     2
   Also, in the triangle on the left, we have:
         7    6   𝑥    2    7   6
         1    𝑥   2    13
         3    𝑥   15
   Next, both outside triangles have sides of length 6 and 7 with angles between them.
   Since the measure of the angle in the triangle on the left 54° is less than the one in the
   triangle on the right 67° , the opposite side on the left must be less than the opposite side
   on the right. So, 𝑥 2 11.
                         𝑥 13
   Putting it all together, we have: 3 𝑥, equivalent to 𝑥          3, which is more restrictive than
   𝑥 2, so we use the more restrictive 3 𝑥.
   We also have: 𝑥 13, which is more restrictive than 𝑥            15, so we use the more
   restrictive 𝑥 13.
   Finally, since 3    𝑥 and 𝑥      13, we have 𝟑       𝒙     𝟏𝟑

Scalene                                                Isosceles
   A Scalene Triangle has 3 sides of different           An Isosceles Triangle has 2 sides the same
   lengths. Because the sides are of                     length (i.e., congruent). Because two

Example 4.8: Find the values of 𝑥 and 𝑦 based on the diagram.
     This problem becomes easier if we label a few more angles.
     See the diagram on the right.
     Angles opposite congruent sides in isosceles triangles are
     congruent, which helps with our labeling.
     In the triangle on the right, the sum of the interior angles must be 180°, so,
         𝑏         180     37      37          106.
     The adjacent angles marked 𝑎° and 𝑏° form a linear pair, so,
         𝑎         180     106         74.
     The center triangle has two angles of 𝑎° and one angle of
     𝑦°, which must add to 180°, so,
         𝒚         180     74      74          𝟑𝟐.
     Finally, along the top right, angles marked 37°, 𝑎°, and 𝑥° must add to 180° in order to
     form a straight angle, so,
         𝒙         180     37      74          𝟔𝟗.


Example 4.9: Find the value of 𝑦 and the perimeter of the triangle.
     Legs opposite congruent angles in isosceles triangles are congruent.
         𝑦           5𝑦    24
         𝑦          5𝑦     24      0

         𝒚         𝟖, 𝟑          (2 possibilities)
         If we plug each of these values into the lengths of the sides shown in the diagram, we
         always get positive numbers, so there are two cases. If we had gotten a length that was
         negative for either 𝑦 8 or 𝑦        3, we would have had to discard that solution.
     The perimeter of the triangle is: 𝑃                    𝑦        4𝑦      15        5𝑦     24     𝑦    9𝑦     39.

                  Sides of this triangle are 64, 64, 47, which gives a viable triangle.
         Case 2 (𝑦              3): 𝑃          𝑦      9𝑦    39        3       9∙       3      39    𝟐𝟏.

                                  Congruent Triangles

The following theorems present conditions under which triangles are congruent.

Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Congruence
                                                  SAS congruence requires the congruence of
                                                  two sides and the angle between those sides.
                                                  Note that there is no such thing as SSA
                                                  congruence; the congruent angle must be
                                                  between the two congruent sides.

ide-Side-Side (SSS) Congruence
                                                  SSS congruence requires the congruence of all
                                                  three sides. If all of the sides are congruent
                                                  then all of the angles must be congruent. The
                                                  converse is not true; there is no such thing as
                                                  AAA congruence.


Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) Congruence

                                                  ASA congruence requires the congruence of
                                                  two angles and the side between those angles.

                                                          Note: ASA and AAS combine to provide
                                                          congruence of two triangles whenever
                                                          any two angles and any one side of the
Angle-Angle-Side (AAS) Congruence                         triangles are congruent.

                                                  AAS congruence requires the congruence of
                                                  two angles and a side which is not between
                                                  those angles.



Hypotenuse Leg (HL) Congruence
                                                  HL can be used if the triangles in question
                                                  have right angles. It requires the congruence
                                                  of the hypotenuse and one of the other legs.

CPCTC
CPCTC means “corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent.” It is a very
powerful tool in geometry proofs and is often used shortly after a step in the proof where a pair
of triangles is proved to be congruent.

Example 4.10: Given that BE is a perpendicular bisector of CD, find ED.
   In the diagram, CA ≅ DA because BE bisects CD.
   So, ∆CAB ≅ ∆DAB by SAS, and ∆CAE ≅ ∆DAE by SAS.
   The two hypotenuses (yep, that’s the plural form of
   hypotenuse) of the triangles on the right side of the
   diagram are congruent. So,
         7x      10       2x        20
         5x         30
         x      6
   CA         DA, so y          4
   Finally, ED EC x 2y (because ∆CAE ≅ ∆DAE, and ED and EC are corresponding
   parts of those congruent triangles).

Example 4.11: Given ∆𝑃𝑄𝑅 ≅ ∆𝐽𝐾𝐿, 𝑃𝑄                          9𝑥     45, 𝐽𝐾   6𝑥   15, 𝐾𝐿    2𝑥, 𝐽𝐿      5𝑥, what is
the value of 𝑥?
     It’s helpful to draw a picture for this problem.
     Notice that congruent segments 𝑃𝑄 and 𝐽𝐾 have
     measures 9𝑥 45 and 6𝑥 15. Then:
         9𝑥      45        6𝑥       15
         3𝑥         60
         𝒙      𝟐𝟎
     We are not quite finished, even though we found a value for 𝑥. We need to check the sides
     of ∆𝐽𝐾𝐿 to make sure this results in a viable triangle:
         2𝑥         40,    5𝑥           100,    6𝑥    15     135
         Sides of 40, 100, 135 are viable in a triangle because 40                100      135.
         Note that if 𝑃𝑄 12𝑥 45, we would have calculated 𝑥 10. Then, the sides would
         have been 20, 50, 75, which is not a viable triangle because 20 50 75. If this were
         the case, this problem would have no solution.

     With parallel lines, we will typically look for alternate interior
     angles or corresponding angles to prove things. Also, this looks

                                            Centers of Triangles

The following are all points which can be considered the center of a triangle.

Centroid (Medians)

                           The centroid is the intersection of the three medians of a triangle. A median is a
                           line segment drawn from a vertex to the midpoint of the side of the triangle that
                           is opposite the vertex.

        The centroid is located 2/3 of the way from a vertex to the opposite side. That is, the distance from a
         vertex to the centroid is double the length from the centroid to the midpoint of the opposite line.
        The medians of a triangle create 6 inner triangles of equal area.


Orthocenter (Altitudes)

                         The orthocenter is the intersection of the three altitudes of a triangle. An
                         altitude is a line segment drawn from a vertex to a point on the opposite side
                         (extended, if necessary) that is perpendicular to that side.

        In an acute triangle, the orthocenter is inside the triangle.
        In a right triangle, the orthocenter is the right angle vertex.
        In an obtuse triangle, the orthocenter is outside the triangle.


Circumcenter (Perpendicular Bisectors)

                         The circumcenter is the intersection of the
                         perpendicular bisectors of the three sides of the
                         triangle. A perpendicular bisector is a line which             Euler Line: Interestingly,
                                                                                        the centroid, orthocenter
                         both bisects the side and is perpendicular to the
                                                                                        and circumcenter of a
                         side. The circumcenter is also the center of the
                                                                                        triangle are collinear (i.e.,
                         circle circumscribed about the triangle.                       lie on the same line,
                                                                                        which is called the Euler
        In an acute triangle, the circumcenter is inside the triangle.                 Line).
        In a right triangle, the circumcenter is the midpoint of the hypotenuse.
        In an obtuse triangle, the circumcenter is outside the triangle.


Incenter (Angle Bisectors)

                             The incenter is the intersection of the angle bisectors of the three angles of
                             the triangle. An angle bisector cuts an angle into two congruent angles, each
                             of which is half the measure of the original angle. The incenter is also the
                             center of the circle inscribed in the triangle.

        The centroid is located 2/3 of the way from a vertex to the opposite side.
        The medians of a triangle create 6 inner triangles of equal area.

   From the diagram, we can see that Points D, E, F are midpoints of the sides of ∆ABC. So,

Altitude (Height)
The formula for the length of a height of a triangle is derived
from Heron’s formula for the area of a triangle:

                  𝟏
where, 𝒔              𝒂     𝒃   𝒄 , and
                  𝟐
              𝒂, 𝒃, 𝒄 are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.


Median
The formula for the length of a median of a triangle is:
                  𝟏
         𝒎                𝟐𝒂𝟐   𝟐𝒃𝟐      𝒄𝟐
                  𝟐
where, 𝒂, 𝒃, 𝒄 are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.


Angle Bisector
The formula for the length of an angle bisector of a triangle is:

                                 𝒄𝟐
         𝒕         𝒂𝒃 𝟏
                                𝒂 𝒃 𝟐

where, 𝒂, 𝒃, 𝒄 are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

                                      Polygons - Basics

Basic Definitions
Polygon: a closed path of three or more line segments, where:
     no two sides with a common endpoint are collinear, and
     each segment is connected at its endpoints to exactly two other segments.
Side: a segment that is connected to other segments (which are also sides) to form a polygon.
Vertex: a point at the intersection of two sides of the polygon. (plural form: vertices)
Diagonal: a segment, from one vertex to another, which is not a side.

                  Side



Concave: A polygon in which it is possible to draw a diagonal “outside” the
      polygon. (Notice the orange diagonal drawn outside the polygon at
      right.) Concave polygons actually look like they have a “cave” in them.


Convex: A polygon in which it is not possible to draw a diagonal “outside” the
      polygon. (Notice that all of the orange diagonals are inside the polygon
      at right.) Convex polygons appear more “rounded” and do not contain
      “caves.”

How Many Diagonals Does a Convex Polygon Have?
Believe it or not, this is a common question with a simple solution. Consider a polygon with
𝒏 𝟑 sides and, therefore, 𝒏 vertices.
   Each of the n vertices of the polygon can be connected to 𝒏 𝟑 other vertices with
    diagonals. That is, it can be connected to all other vertices except itself and the two to
    which it is connected by sides. So, there are 𝒏 ∙ 𝒏 𝟑 lines to be drawn as diagonals.
   However, when we do this, we draw each diagonal twice because we draw it once from
    each of its two endpoints. So, the number of diagonals is actually half of the number we
    calculated above.
    Therefore, the number of diagonals in an n-sided polygon is:

Amazing Property of Quadrilaterals
Steps:
    1. Draw any quadrilateral (green in diagram).
    2. Construct squares along each side of the
       quadrilateral.
    3. Connect the midpoints of opposite squares
       with segments.
Result: The two segments connecting the
midpoints of the squares are congruent and
perpendicular.
Diagram: In the diagram to the right, segments AC
and BD are both congruent and perpendicular. It
may not look like the segments are the same length, but they are. On a printed page, each
segment is 4.4 cm long. Amazing!




Example 6.1: Find the side length of the rhombus if its diagonals measure 14 inches and 48
inches.
     Lets take one triangle from the inside of the rhombus shown
     to the right. See below.
                         We know that the diagonals are
                         perpendicular, so we have a right
                         triangle. The two red sides of the triangle are half of the length of the
                         diagonals from which they come.
                         We have sides, then, of 𝑎          14   2   7 and 𝑏   48   2     24.
     It remains for us to calculate the value of 𝑐. Let’s use the Pythagorean Theorem:
         𝑐    𝑎    𝑏
         𝑐    7    24
         𝑐    49   576    625
         𝒄 𝟐𝟓 inches (remember to use units in the answer because they are in the statement
         of the problem).

Example 6.2: Find the values of 𝑥 and 𝑦 in the parallelogram below.

     In a parallelogram, opposite angles are congruent and                              (2x + 28)o
     consecutive angles are supplementary. This gives us:
         𝑥     5𝑥 2𝑥      28
         𝑥     3𝑥 28      0
                                                                      (x2 + 5x)o         (8y)o
          𝑥    7 𝑥 4        0
         𝑥      7 or 4
     If 𝑥       7, then the angles involved are equal to 2𝑥 28 °  2 7    28 ° 14°.
     If 𝑥     4, then the angles involved are equal to 2𝑥 28 °   2 4  28 ° 36°.
     Both of these angle values are possible, so we have two cases:
         If 𝑥   7, then the angles involved are 14°. Since consecutive angles are
         supplementary, 14 8𝑦 180.
                             8𝑦 166
                              𝑦 20.75 and the solution is: 𝒙        𝟕, 𝒚 𝟐𝟎. 𝟕𝟓
         If 𝑥 4, then the angles involved are 36°. Since consecutive angles are
         supplementary, 36 8𝑦 180.
                            8𝑦 144
                              𝑦 18 and the solution is: 𝒙 𝟒, 𝒚 𝟏𝟖
     Both solutions are valid because they both result in positive angle values.


Example 6.3: Find the values of 𝑥 and 𝑦 so that the figure shown is a parallelogram.

     In order for the figure to be a parallelogram, opposite
     sides must be congruent. So,
                                                                12
       Top and bottom sides:    Left and right sides:

     Combine above results:

       2𝑥 4                        2   𝑦

Example 6.4: Find the values of 𝑥 and 𝑦 from the rhombus below.

     In a rhombus, the diagonals intersect at right angles, so:
         5𝑥 5𝑦 90
         𝑥 𝑦 18
         𝑦 18 𝑥
     In a rhombus, the sides have the same length, so:

         6𝑥   20    2𝑦
         3𝑥   10    𝑦
     Combining the two equations:
       3𝑥 10 18 𝑥                 𝑦           18    𝑥
       4𝑥 28                      𝑦           18    7
       𝒙 𝟕                        𝒚           𝟏𝟏


Example 6.5: Find the values of 𝑥 and 𝑦 if 𝐴𝐷 ≅ 𝐵𝐶 and ABCD is a parallelogram.
     𝐴𝐷 and 𝐵𝐶 are diagonals. Since the diagonals are congruent and
     ABCD is a parallelogram, we conclude that ABCD is a rectangle.
     Therefore, all four interior angles measure 90°. So,
         14𝑦 20       90            12𝑥 42 90            7𝑦 55    90

         𝒚 𝟓                        𝒙 𝟏𝟏                 𝑦 5
     Note that the first and third column result in the same value for 𝑦. If this were not the
     case, we would say this problem is overdetermined, and there would be no solution for 𝑦.


Example 6.6: What is the measure of 𝐻𝐽 in the parallelogram below.
         First, opposite angles in a parallelogram have
         equal measures, so we can find 𝑥 as follows:
              3𝑥 10        46
              3𝑥 36
              𝑥 12
         Then, opposite sides have the same length, so

Example 6.7: If a quadrilateral has congruent diagonals, is it a rectangle: never, sometimes, or
always?
   For a problem like this, it is a good idea to draw the required shape, but
   to put as little structure in the shape as allowed by the question.
   Sometimes. Rectangles have congruent diagonals, but it is possible to
   construct a quadrilateral with congruent diagonals that is not a rectangle.
   See the figure to the right, which has congruent diagonals.


Example 6.8: If a quadrilateral is a rhombus, then it is a parallelogram: never, sometimes, or
always?
   Always. This can be seen in the quadrilateral tree at the beginning of this chapter. A
   rhombus is defined to be a parallelogram with four congruent sides.


Example 6.9: A triangle can be a kite: never, sometimes, or always?
   Never. Triangles have three sides, but kites have four congruent sides.



Example 6.10: Given a trapezoid with bases of length 2𝑥 14 cm and 8𝑥                           4 cm, and a
midline of length 𝑚 5𝑥 15 cm. find the length of the midline.

                                Introduction to Transformation

A Transformation is a mapping of the pre-image of a geometric figure onto an image that
retains key characteristics of the pre-image.

Definitions
The Pre-Image is the geometric figure before it has been transformed.

The Image is the geometric figure after it has been transformed.

A mapping is an association between objects. Transformations are types of mappings. In the
figures below, we say ABCD is mapped onto A’B’C’D’, or 𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷 ⎯ 𝐴’𝐵’𝐶’𝐷’. The order of the
vertices is critical to a properly named mapping.

An Isometry is a one-to-one mapping that preserves lengths. Transformations that are
isometries (i.e., preserve length) are called rigid transformations.

                          Introduction to Transformation (cont’d)

Transformation of a Point
A point is the easiest object to transform. Simply reflect, rotate or translate it following the
rules for the transformation selected. By transforming key points first, any transformation
becomes much easier.

Transformation of a Geometric Figure
To transform any geometric figure, it is only necessary to transform the items that define the
figure, and then re-form it. For example:
        To transform a line segment, transform its two endpoints, and then connect the
         resulting images with a line segment.
        To transform a ray, transform the initial point and any other point on the ray, and then
         construct a ray using the resulting images.
        To transform a line, transform any two points on the line, and then fit a line through the
         resulting images.
        To transform a polygon, transform each of its vertices, and then connect the resulting
         images with line segments.
        To transform a circle, transform its center and, if necessary, its radius. From the
         resulting images, construct the image circle.
        To transform other conic sections (parabolas, ellipses and hyperbolas), transform the
         foci, vertices and/or directrix. From the resulting images, construct the image conic
         section.

Example 7.1: Reflect Quadrilateral ABCD over the mirror shown.
     To reflect a point over a mirror:
         Connect the point to the mirror with a segment that is perpendicular to the mirror.
         Draw the segment again, in the same direction, beyond the mirror.
         Place the image point at the end of the second segment.
     See the diagrams below.

                                            Reflection

Definitions
Reflection is flipping a figure across a mirror.
The Line of Reflection is the mirror through which the
reflection takes place.
Note that:
         The line segment connecting corresponding points in
          the image and pre-image is bisected by the mirror.
         The line segment connecting corresponding points in
          the image and pre-image is perpendicular to the mirror.


Reflection through an Axis or the Line 𝒚                𝒙
Reflection of the point (a, b) through the x‐ or y‐axis or the line 𝑦    𝑥 gives the following

If you forget the above table, start with a point such as 3, 2 on a set of coordinate axes.
Reflect the point through the selected line and see which set of “a, b” coordinates works.



Line of Symmetry
A Line of Symmetry is any line through which a figure can be mapped onto itself. The thin black
lines in the following figures show their axes of symmetry:

Example 7.2: Which of the following quadrilaterals has line symmetry? Square, rectangle,
isosceles trapezoid, rhombus?
    A figure has line symmetry if it is possible to draw a line so that the image looks the same
    when reflected over the line.
    In drawing the figures to help answer this problem, it is important to draw them in their
    most general form. For example, when considering a rhombus, we would not want to draw
    a square (even though a square is a type of rhombus) to analyze because a rhombus is not
    required to have the right angles contained in a square. Doing so could lead us to the
    wrong conclusions.
    In the figures below, lines of symmetry are drawn as dashed green segments.




     Answer: all of the quadrilaterals mentioned have line symmetry.


Example 7.3: Reflect ∆𝐴𝐵𝐶 over the 𝑥-axis and over the 𝑦-axis. What are the 𝑥 and 𝑦
coordinates after reflection?
     Starting coordinates (black in the diagram):
               2, 1 ,     3, 4 ,        5, 2
     After reflection over the 𝑥-axis (orange in the diagram):
         𝑥-values are unchanged. 𝑦-values change sign.
               2, 1 ,   3, 4 ,   5, 2
     After reflection over the 𝑦-axis (magenta in the diagram):
         𝑥-values change sign. 𝑦-values are unchanged.
              2, 1 , 3, 4 , 5, 2

     Notice the symmetry in the diagram. Symmetry is often noticed because it looks “pretty.”

                                             Rotation

Definitions
Rotation is turning a figure by an angle about a fixed point.
The Center of Rotation is the point about which the figure is
rotated. Point P, at right, is the center of rotation.
The Angle of Rotation determines the extent of the rotation.
The angle is formed by the rays that connect the center of
rotation to the pre-image and the image of the rotation. Angle
P, at right, is the angle of rotation. Though shown only for
Point A, the angle is the same for any of the figure’s 4 vertices.

Note: In performing rotations, it is important to indicate the direction of the rotation –
clockwise or counterclockwise.

Rotation about the Origin
Rotation of the point (a, b) about the origin (0, 0) gives the following results:

              (a, b)                180⁰                      180⁰                  (-a, -b)
              (a, b)                270⁰                      90⁰                   (-b, a)
              (a, b)                360⁰                      360⁰                  (a, b)

If you forget the above table, start with the point 3, 2 on a set of coordinate axes. Rotate the
point by the selected angle and see which set of “a, b” coordinates works.


Rotational Symmetry
A figure in a plane has Rotational Symmetry if it can be mapped onto itself by a rotation of
180⁰ or less. Any regular polygon has rotational symmetry, as does a circle. Here are some
examples of figures with rotational symmetry:




Version 4.2                                  Page 59 of 137                              August 26, 2023

Example 7.4: Which of the following quadrilaterals has rotational symmetry? Square,
rectangle, isosceles trapezoid, rhombus?
    A figure has rotational symmetry if it is possible to rotate the image and get a result that
    looks the same. The order of a rotational symmetry is the number of positions the shape
    can take (within a 360˚ rotation) and look the same.
    In the figures below, lines of symmetry are drawn as dashed green segments.




     Answer: A rectangle has rotational symmetry of order 2 (0˚ and 180˚ rotations).
                   A square has rotational symmetry of order 4 (0˚, 90˚, 180˚ and 270˚ rotations).
                   An isosceles trapezoid does not have rotational symmetry.
                   A rhombus has rotational symmetry of order 2 (0˚ and 180˚ rotations).


Example 7.5: Rotate ∆𝐴𝐵𝐶 counterclockwise by 90° about the origin and, separately,
clockwise by 90° about the origin. What are the 𝑥 and 𝑦 coordinates after rotation?
     Rotating “about” a point means that the point is the center of rotation.
     Starting coordinates (black in the diagram):
               2, 1 ,     3, 4 ,        5, 2
     A rotation of 90° counterclockwise about the origin produces
     a mapping of 𝑎, 𝑏 → 𝑏, 𝑎 . That is, the 𝑥 and 𝑦
     coordinates switch and the new 𝑥-value changes its sign.
     After rotation about the origin, (orange in the diagram):
              1, 2 , 4, 3 , 2, 5
     A rotation of 90° clockwise about the origin produces a mapping of 𝑎, 𝑏 → 𝑏, 𝑎 . That
     is, the 𝑥 and 𝑦 coordinates switch and the new 𝑦-value changes its sign.
     After reflection over the 𝑦-axis (magenta in the diagram):
               1, 2 ,   4, 3 ,   2, 5

     Notice that the two rotations produce coordinates that are a 180° rotation from each
     other. That is, rotating 1, 2 , 4, 3 , 2, 5 by 180° gives 1, 2 , 4, 3 , 2, 5 , and
     rotating 1, 2 , 4, 3 , 2, 5 by 180° gives 1, 2 , 4, 3 , 2, 5 . That’s because a
     point rotated 90° counterclockwise the same point rotated 90° clockwise are 180° apart.

                                            Translation

Definitions
Translation is sliding a figure in the plane. Each
point in the figure is moved the same distance in
the same direction. The result is an image that
looks the same as the pre-image in every way,
except it has been moved to a different location
in the plane.
Each of the four orange line segments in the
figure at right has the same length and direction.


When Two Reflections             One Translation
If two mirrors are parallel, then reflection through
one of them, followed by a reflection through the
second is a translation.
In the figure at right, the black lines show the paths
of the two reflections; this is also the path of the
resulting translation. Note the following:
        The distance of the resulting translation
         (e.g., from A to A’’) is double the distance
         between the mirrors.
        The black lines of movement are perpendicular to both mirrors.


Defining Translations in the Coordinate Plane (Using Vectors)
A translation moves each point by the same distance in the same direction. In the coordinate
plane, this is equivalent to moving each point the same amount in the x‐direction and the same
amount in the y‐direction. This combination of x‐ and y‐direction movement is described by a
mathematical concept called a vector.

In the above figure, translation from A to 𝑨′′ moves 10 in the x‐direction and the -3 in the y‐
direction. In vector notation, this is: 𝑨𝑨′′⃑ 〈10, 3〉. Notice the “half-ray” symbol over the
two points and the funny-looking brackets around the movement values.

So, the translation resulting from the two reflections in the above figure moves each point of
the pre-image by the vector 𝑨𝑨′′⃑. Every translation can be defined by the vector representing
its movement in the coordinate plane.

Translation Coordinate Form
Translations are often shown as coordinates with an enclosed mapping, so a translations of
 𝑥, 𝑦 → 𝑥 2, 𝑦 5 means decrease the 𝑥-values of translated points by 2 and increase the
𝑦-values of translated points by 5.


Example 7.6: Translate the triangle shown in the diagram according to the mapping:
 𝑥, 𝑦 → 𝑥 6, 𝑦 2 .
     Starting coordinates (black in the diagram):

               2, 1 ,    3, 4 ,       5, 2
     After translation (orange in the diagram):
         𝑥-values increase by 6. 𝑦-values decrease by 2.
              4, 3 , 3, 6 , 1, 4
     When you look at the result of a translation in a graph, it
     often looks like we just slid the figure from one place to
     another (which we did). The shape retains its shape and orientation.


Example 7.7: If a point 3, 6 is translated so that its image is   1, 12 , what is the translation
coordinate form of the translation?
     This question boils down to asking how far 𝑥 moved and how far 𝑦 moved, from preimage
      3, 6 to image 1, 12 . The easiest way to answer this is to subtract the two points to
     obtain the movement vector, then convert that to the desired form.
         Image:                          1, 12
         Preimage:                       3, 6
         Movement vector:              〈 4, 6〉
     To obtain the translation coordinate form, add the movement vector 〈 4, 6〉 to the
     general point 𝑥, 𝑦 .

                                                     Compositions

When multiple transformations are combined, the result is called a Composition of the
Transformations. Two examples of this are:
        Combining two reflections through parallel mirrors to generate a translation (see the
         previous page).
        Combining a translation and a reflection to generate what is called a glide reflection.
         The glide part of the name refers to translation, which is a kind of gliding of a figure on
         the plane.

              Note: In a glide reflection, if the line of reflection is parallel to the direction of the
              translation, it does not matter whether the reflection or the translation is performed first.

Composition Theorem
The composition of multiple isometries is as Isometry. Put more simply, if transformations that
preserve length are combined, the composition will preserve length. It is also true that if
transformations that preserve angle measure are combined, the composition will preserve
angle measure.


Order of Composition
Order matters in most compositions that involve more than one class of transformation. If you
apply multiple transformations of the same kind (e.g., reflection, rotation, or translation), order
generally does not matter; however, applying transformations in more than one class may
produce different final images if the order is switched.

Notice that the examples above involved performing the same transformations on the same
starting triangle, but in a different order. The results are very different, illustrating that order
matters in compositions that involve more than one class of transformation.

                      Rotation About a Point Other than the Origin

Rotating an object about a point involves rotating each point of the object by the same angle
about that point. For a polygon, this is accomplished by rotating each vertex and then
connecting them with segments, so you mainly have to worry about the vertices, which are
points. An example of the process of rotating a point about another point is described below.
It is a good example of what can be accomplished with a composition of transformations.

Let’s define the following points:
     The point about which the rotation will take place, i.e., the center of rotation: 𝑥 , 𝑦 .
     The initial point (before rotation), i.e., the preimage: 𝑥 , 𝑦 .
     The final point (after rotation), i.e. the image: 𝑥 , 𝑦 .

The problem is to determine 𝑥 , 𝑦 if we are given 𝑥 , 𝑦 and 𝑥 , 𝑦 . It involves 3 steps:
   1. Convert the problem to one of rotating a point about the origin (a much easier
       problem).
   2. Perform the rotation.
   3. Reverse the translation in Step 1.

We consider each step separately, algebraically and geometrically, in the following example:

Example 7.10: Rotate a point by 90⁰ about another point.

 Step 1: Convert the problem to one of rotating a point about the
 origin:
    First, we translate our point 2, 1 and the center of rotation
     2, 3 so that the center of rotation moves to 0, 0 . That
    involves subtracting (2, 3) from both the point and the center.
                       General Situation                                  Example
         Points in this step                           Points in this step
              Rotation Center: 𝑥 , 𝑦                       Rotation Center: 2, 3
              Initial point: 𝑥 , 𝑦                         Initial point: 2, 1
              Image of translation                         Image of translation
         Translate our point by subtracting 𝑥 , 𝑦      Translate our point by subtracting 2, 3
         from 𝑥 , 𝑦 . The resulting image is:          from 2, 1 . The resulting image is:
                        𝑥    𝑥 ,𝑦    𝑦                                      4, 2
     The next steps depend on whether we are making a clockwise or counter clockwise
     rotation.

Example 7.10a: Clockwise Rotation:

 Step 2: Perform the rotation about the origin:
    Rotating 90⁰ clockwise about the origin 0, 0 is simply a
    process of switching the 𝑥- and 𝑦-values of a point and
    negating the new 𝑦-term. That is, 𝑥, 𝑦 becomes 𝑦, 𝑥
    after clockwise rotation by 90⁰.
              General Situation                    Example
         Pre-rotated point               Pre-rotated point
         (from Step 1):                  (from Step 1):

         Point after rotation:           Point after rotation:
              𝑦    𝑦 , 𝑥       𝑥                       2, 4


 Step 3: Reverse the translation performed in Step 1.
    To do this, simply translate the image of rotation by the coordinates of the center of
    rotation (adding back what was subtracted in Step 1).
                      General Situation                                     Example
         Point after rotation (from Step 2):              Point after rotation (from Step 2):
                      𝑦     𝑦 , 𝑥     𝑥                                         2, 4
         Add back the point of rotation 𝑥 , 𝑦             Add back the center of rotation 2, 3 :
                𝑦     𝑦     𝑥 , 𝑥     𝑥     𝑦                                 0, 7
         which gives us the final image: 𝒙𝟐 , 𝒙𝟐


 Finally, here are the formulas for 𝒙𝟐 and 𝒚𝟐 :

                                                               Notice that the formulas for clockwise
               Clockwise Rotation
                                                               rotation (this page) and counter-clockwise
                 𝒙𝟐     𝒚𝟏    𝒚𝟎    𝒙𝟎                         rotation (next page) by 90⁰ are the same
                                                               except the terms in magenta are negated

Interesting note: If you are asked to find the point about which a rotation occurred, you can
substitute the values for the starting point 𝑥 , 𝑦 and the ending point 𝑥 , 𝑦 in the above
equations and solve for 𝑥 and 𝑦 .

Example 7.10b: Counterclockwise Rotation:

 Step 2: Perform the rotation about the origin:
    Rotating 90⁰ counterclockwise about the origin
     0, 0 is simply a process of switching the 𝑥- and
    𝑦-values of a point and negating the new 𝑥-term.
    That is, 𝑥, 𝑦 becomes 𝑦, 𝑥 after
    counterclockwise rotation by 90⁰.

 Step 3: Reverse the translation performed in Step 1.
    To do this, simply translate the image of rotation by the coordinates of the center of
    rotation (adding back what was subtracted in Step 1).

         which gives us the final image: 𝒙𝟐 , 𝒙𝟐


 Finally, here are the formulas for 𝒙𝟐 and 𝒚𝟐 :

                                                             Notice that the formulas for clockwise
              Counterclockwise Rotation

Interesting note: The point half-way between the clockwise and counterclockwise rotations of
90⁰ is the center of rotation, 𝑥 , 𝑦 . In the example, halfway between 0, 7 and 4, 1 is
 2, 3 .

Notice in the above example that units can be treated the same as factors; they can be used in
fractions and they cancel when they divide. This fact can be used to figure out whether
multiplication or division is needed in a problem. Consider the following:
Example 8.3: How long did it take for a car traveling at 48 miles per hour to go 32 miles?

Consider the units of each item:         32 miles                 48

        If you multiply, you get:    32 miles ∙ 48               1,536       . This is clearly wrong!

        If you divide, you get:     32 miles       48             miles ∙                hour. Now, this
         looks reasonable. Notice how the "miles" unit cancel out in the final answer.
We could have solved this problem by remembering that 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒           𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 ∙ 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒, or 𝑑 𝑟𝑡.
However, paying close attention to the units also generates the correct answer. In addition, the
”units” technique always works, no matter what the problem!

                                         Similar Polygons


In similar polygons,
        Corresponding angles are congruent, and
        Corresponding sides are proportional.

Both of these conditions are necessary for two
polygons to be similar. Conversely, when two
polygons are similar, all of the corresponding
angles are congruent and all of the sides are proportional.


Naming Similar Polygons
Similar polygons should be named such that corresponding angles are in the same location in
the name, and the order of the points in the name should “follow the polygon around.”
Example 8.4: The polygons above could be shown similar with the following names:
                                𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷𝐸𝐹𝐺𝐻𝐼 ~ 𝑆𝑇𝑈𝑉𝑊𝑋𝑌𝑍
It would also be acceptable to show the similarity as:
                                𝐷𝐸𝐹𝐺𝐻𝐼𝐴𝐵𝐶 ~ 𝑉𝑊𝑋𝑌𝑍𝑆𝑇𝑈
Any names that preserve the order of the points and keeps corresponding angles in
corresponding locations in the names would be acceptable.


Proportions
One common problem relating to similar polygons is to present three side lengths, where two
of the sides correspond, and to ask for the length of the side corresponding to the third length.

Example 8.5: In the above similar polygons, if 𝐵𝐶        20, 𝐸𝐹   12, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑊𝑋    6, 𝑤ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑖𝑠 𝑇𝑈?
This problem is solvable with proportions. To do so properly, it is important to relate
corresponding items in the proportion:

                     𝐵𝐶    𝐸𝐹                 20      12
                                     ⎯                        ⎯     𝑇𝑈    10
                     𝑇𝑈    𝑊𝑋                 𝑇𝑈      6

Notice that the left polygon is represented on the top of both proportions and that the left-
most segments of the two polygons are in the left fraction.

                                Scale Factors of Similar Polygons

From the similar polygons below, the following is known about the lengths of the sides:

                       𝐴𝐵       𝐵𝐶   𝐶𝐷   𝐷𝐸        𝐸𝐹       𝐹𝐺   𝐺𝐻   𝐻𝐴
                                                                            𝑘
                       𝑆𝑇       𝑇𝑈   𝑈𝑉   𝑉𝑊        𝑊𝑋       𝑋𝑌   𝑌𝑍   𝑍𝐴

That is, the ratios of corresponding sides in the
two polygons are the same and they equal
some constant 𝒌, called the scale factor of the
two polygons. The value of 𝑘, then, is all you
need to know to relate corresponding sides in
the two polygons.

Finding the Missing Length
Any time the student is asked to find the missing length in similar polygons:
    Look for two corresponding sides for which the values are known.
    Calculate the value of 𝑘.
    Use the value of 𝑘 to solve for the missing length.

𝑘 is a measure of the relative size of the two polygons. Using this knowledge, it is possible to
put into words an easily understandable relationship between the polygons.
        Let Polygon 1 be the one whose sides are in the numerators of the fractions.
        Let Polygon 2 be the one whose sides are in the denominators of the fractions.
        Then, it can be said that Polygon 1 is 𝒌 times the size of the Polygon 2.

Example 8.6: In the above similar polygons, if 𝐵𝐶        20, 𝐸𝐹    12, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑊𝑋    6, 𝑤ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑖𝑠 𝑇𝑈?
Seeing that 𝐸𝐹 and 𝑊𝑋 relate, calculate:

   𝐸𝐹         12
                   2   𝑘
   𝑊𝑋         6

Then solve for 𝑇𝑈 based on the value of 𝑘:

   𝐵𝐶                      20
              𝑘    →            2    →    𝑇𝑈        10
   𝑇𝑈                      𝑇𝑈

Also, since 𝑘 2, the length of every side in the blue polygon is double the length of its
corresponding side in the orange polygon.

                                       Dilation of Polygons

A dilation is a special case of transformation involving similar polygons. It can be thought of as
a transformation that creates a polygon of the same shape but a different size from the original.
Key elements of a dilation are:
        Scale Factor – The scale factor of similar polygons is the constant 𝑘 which represents the
         relative sizes of the polygons.
        Center – The center is the point from which the dilation takes place.

Note that 𝑘     0 and 𝑘      1 in order to generate a second polygon. Then,
        If 𝑘   1, the dilation is called an “enlargement.”
        If 𝑘   1, the dilation is called a “reduction.”


Dilations with Center (0, 0)
In coordinate geometry, dilations are often performed with the center being the origin 0, 0 .
In that case, to obtain the dilation of a polygon:
        Multiply the coordinates of each vertex by the scale factor 𝑘, and
        Connect the vertices of the dilation with line segments (i.e., connect the dots).

Examples:
In the following examples:
        The green polygon is the original.
        The blue polygon is the dilation.
        The dashed orange lines show the movement away from
         (enlargement) or toward (reduction) the center, which is
         the origin in all 3 examples.

Notice that, in each example:

 distance from center               distance from center
   to a vertex of the          𝑘∙     to a vertex of the
    dilated polygon                   original polygon

This fact can be used to construct dilations when coordinate axes
are not available. Alternatively, the student could draw a set of
coordinate axes as an aid to performing the dilation.

Example 8.7: Given that                      , what is the scale factor of ∆𝐴𝐵𝐸 to ∆𝐷𝐵𝐶?

     There is only one set of corresponding sides to work with in this
     diagram, so there is only one ratio we can calculate directly from

     the diagram. Fortunately, we are given                     , so
     that’s all we need.

                        2.

     Therefore, the scale factor of ∆𝐴𝐵𝐸 to ∆𝐷𝐵𝐶 is 𝟐.




Example 8.8: Given a triangle with vertices at 1, 4 , 5, 2 , 2, 3 , what are the coordinates
of the vertices of the triangle after dilation 𝐷: 𝑥, 𝑦 → 2𝑥, 3𝑦 ?
     The coordinates of the preimage are 1, 4 , 5, 2 ,       2, 3 .
     The dilation doubles all 𝑥- values and triples all 𝑦-values. So, the coordinates of the image
     are:
              𝟐, 𝟏𝟐 , 𝟏𝟎, 𝟔 ,   𝟒, 𝟗



Example 8.9: Given two similar cubes have a scale factor of 4: 3, what is the ratio of their
volumes?
    Volumes exist in three dimensions, so the ratio of their volumes would be the third power
    (i.e., the cube) of the scale factor. In fact, that’s why the third power of a number is
    referred to as the “cube” of the number.

Dilations of Non-Polygons
Any geometric figure can be dilated. In the dilation of the
green circle at right, notice that:
        The dilation factor is 2.
        The original circle has center 7, 3 and radius        5.
        The dilated circle has center 14, 6 and radius        10.
So, the center and radius are both increased by a factor of 𝑘 2. This is true of any figure in a
dilation with the center at the origin. All of the key elements that define the figure are
increased by the scale factor 𝑘.

Dilations with Center 𝒂, 𝒃
In the figures below, the green quadrilaterals are dilated to the blue ones with a scale factor of
𝑘 2. Notice the following:
                            In the figure to the left, the dilation has center
                             0, 0 , whereas in the figure to the right, the
                            dilation has center 4, 3 . The size of the
                            resulting figure is the same in both cases
                            (because 𝑘 2 in both figures), but the
                            location is different.

Graphically, the series of transformations that is equivalent to a dilation from a point 𝑎, 𝑏
other than the origin is shown below. Compare the final result to the figure above (right).
        Step 1: Translate the original figure by      𝑎, 𝑏 to reset the center at the origin.
        Step 2: Perform the dilation.
        Step 3: Translate the dilated figure by 𝑎, 𝑏 . These steps are illustrated below.

The following theorems present conditions under which triangles are similar.

Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Similarity
                                                  SAS similarity requires the proportionality of
                                                  two sides and the congruence of the angle
                                                  between those sides. Note that there is no such
                                                  thing as SSA similarity; the congruent angle must
                                                  be between the two proportional sides.

Side-Side-Side (SSS) Similarity
                                                  SSS similarity requires the proportionality of all
                                                  three sides. If all of the sides are proportional,
                                                  then all of the angles must be congruent.


Angle-Angle (AA) Similarity
                                                  AA similarity requires the congruence of two
                                                  angles and the side between those angles.




Similar Triangle Parts
In similar triangles,
     Corresponding sides are proportional.
     Corresponding angles are congruent.

Establishing the proper names for similar triangles is crucial to line up corresponding vertices.
In the picture above, we can say:
               ∆𝐴𝐵𝐶~∆𝐷𝐸𝐹         or    ∆𝐵𝐶𝐴~∆𝐸𝐹𝐷             or   ∆𝐶𝐴𝐵~∆𝐹𝐷𝐸     or
               ∆𝐴𝐶𝐵~∆𝐷𝐹𝐸         or    ∆𝐵𝐴𝐶~∆𝐸𝐷𝐹             or   ∆𝐶𝐵𝐴~∆𝐹𝐸𝐷

All of these are correct because they match corresponding parts in the naming. Each of these
similarities implies the following relationships between parts of the two triangles:
                       ∠𝐴 ≅ ∠𝐷        and   ∠𝐵 ≅ ∠𝐸           and   ∠𝐶 ≅ ∠𝐹

Setting Up a Table of Proportions

It is often useful to set up a table to identify the proper proportions
in a similarity. Consider the figure to the right. The table might look
something like this:

   Triangle            Left Side           Right Side      Bottom Side

   Top ∆                  AB                  BC                  CA

   Bottom ∆               DE                  EF                  FD

The purpose of a table like this is to organize the information you have about the similar
triangles so that you can readily develop the proportions you need.


Developing the Proportions

To develop proportions from the table:
        Extract the columns needed from the table:

                        AB            BC
                        DE            EF                                 Also from the above
                                                                         table,
        Eliminate the table lines.
                                                                               𝐴𝐵    𝐶𝐴
        Replace the horizontal lines with “division lines.”
                                                                               𝐷𝐸    𝐹𝐷
        Put an equal sign between the two resulting fractions:                𝐵𝐶    𝐶𝐴
                                                                               𝐸𝐹    𝐹𝐷



Solving for the unknown length of a side:
You can extract any two columns you like from the table. Usually, you will have information on
lengths of three of the sides and will be asked to calculate a fourth.

Look in the table for the columns that contain the 4 sides in question, and then set up your
proportion. Substitute known values into the proportion, and solve for the remaining variable.

Example 8.10: Are the triangles in the diagram similar? If so, write the similarity statement
and state the theorem used to determine the similarity.
     We only have the sides to work with, so we must check
     proportions. The easiest way to do this is by increasing
     the sizes of the sides of the triangles as you move from
     left to right in the proportions. So, we want to know if:
         smallest value         middle value        largest value
         smallest value         middle value        largest value
     Side lengths for one triangle go in the numerators of the fractions and side lengths for the
     other triangle go in the denominators of the fractions. So, we want to know if:
         8        9      10
                            ?
         24       27     30
     Simplifying the fractions, we get:                      . Then, by the SSS Similarity Theorem,
     ∆𝑭𝑫𝑬~∆𝑨𝑪𝑩.

A common problem in geometry is to find the missing value in proportions based on a set of
three similar triangles, two of which are inside the third. The diagram often looks like this:

Similar Triangle Relationships

Because all three triangles are similar, we have the relationships in the table below. These
relationships are not obvious from the picture, but are very useful in solving problems based on
the above diagram. Using similarities between the triangles, 2 at a time, we get:

                                         Pythagorean Theorem

In a right triangle, the Pythagorean Theorem says:

                            𝒂𝟐      𝒃𝟐   𝒄𝟐

 where,
  a and b are the lengths of the legs of a right
    triangle, and
  c is the length of the hypotenuse.


Right, Acute, or Obtuse Triangle?
In addition to allowing the solution of right triangles, the Pythagorean Formula can be used to
determine whether a triangle is a right triangle, an acute triangle, or an obtuse triangle.

To determine whether a triangle is obtuse, right, or acute:
    Arrange the lengths of the sides from low to high; call them a, b, and c, in increasing order
    Calculate: 𝑎 , 𝑏 , and 𝑐 .
    Compare: 𝑎        𝑏 vs. 𝑐
    Use the illustrations below to determine which type of triangle you have.

Pythagorean triples are sets of 3 positive integers that meet the requirements of the
Pythagorean Theorem. Because these sets of integers provide “pretty” solutions to geometry
problems, they are a favorite of geometry books and teachers. Knowing what triples exist can
help the student quickly identify solutions to problems that might otherwise take considerable
time to solve.

The relationship among the lengths of the sides of a triangle is dependent on the measures of
the angles in the triangle. For a right triangle (i.e., one that contains a 90⁰ angle), two special
cases are of particular interest. These are shown below:

In a right triangle, we need to know the lengths of two sides to determine the length of the
third. The power of the relationships in the special triangles lies in the fact that we need only
know the length of one side of the triangle to determine the lengths of the other two sides.

                    Trigonometric Function Values in Quadrants II, III, and IV

In quadrants other than Quadrant I, trigonometric values for angles are calculated in the
following manner:
        Draw the angle θ on the Cartesian Plane.
        Calculate the measure of the angle from the x-
         axis to θ.
        Find the value of the trigonometric function of
         the angle in the previous step.
        Assign a “ ” or “ “ sign to the trigonometric
         value based on the function used and the
         quadrant θ is in.

Example 9.16: sin 𝜃                    , tan 𝜃       0. Find the values of sec 𝜃 and cot 𝜃.

    Notice that sin 𝜃            0 , tan 𝜃       0. Therefore, 𝜃 is in 𝑄3, so we draw the angle in that
    quadrant.

    In 𝑄3, 𝑦 is negative; 𝑟 is always positive. Since sin 𝜃                                    , we let
    𝑦         2, 𝑟    3.
    Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we calculate the length of the
    horizontal leg of the triangle:              3         2          √5. Since the angle is in
    𝑄3, 𝑥 is negative, so we must have 𝑥                        √5.

Example 9.17: cot 𝜃          , cos 𝜃      0. Find the value of csc 𝜃 and cos 𝜃.

    Notice that cot 𝜃   0 , cos 𝜃       0. Therefore, 𝜃 is in 𝑄2, so we draw the angle in that
    quadrant.

    In 𝑄2, 𝑥 is negative, and 𝑦 is positive. Since cot 𝜃              , we let 𝑥     9, 𝑦    4.

    Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can calculate the length of the
    hypotenuse of the triangle: 𝑟            9      4      √97.

                                                 Vectors

Definitions
   A vector is a geometric object that has both
    magnitude (length) and direction.
   The Tail of the vector is the end opposite the arrow.
    It represents where the vector is moving from.
   The Head of the vector is the end with the arrow. It                        𝐯    𝑨𝑩⃑
    represents where the vector is moving to.
   The Zero Vector is denoted 0. It has zero length and
    all the properties of zero.
   Two vectors are equal is they have both the same magnitude and the same direction.
 Two vectors are parallel if they have the same or opposite directions. That is, if the angles
    of the vectors are the same or 180⁰ different.
 Two vectors are perpendicular if the difference of the angles of the vectors is 90⁰ or 270⁰.

Magnitude of a Vector
The distance formula gives the magnitude of a vector. If the head and tail of vector v are the
points 𝐴     𝑥 , 𝑦 and 𝐵      𝑥 , 𝑦 , then the magnitude of v is:

                                |𝐯|       𝑨𝑩⃑         𝒙𝟐     𝒙𝟏 𝟐   𝒚𝟐   𝒚𝟏 𝟐

Note that 𝑨𝑩⃑       𝑩𝑨⃑ . The directions of the two vectors are opposite, but their magnitudes
are the same.

Direction of a Vector
The direction of a vector is determined by the angle it makes
with a horizontal line. In the figure at right, the direction is the
angle 𝛉. The value of 𝛉 can be calculated based on the lengths
of the sides of the triangle the vector forms.

where the function tan‐1 is the inverse tangent function. The second equation in the line above
reads “𝜃 is the angle whose tangent is .”

                                                    Operations with Vectors

It is possible to operate with vectors in some of the same ways we operate with numbers. In
particular:

Adding Vectors
Vectors can be added in rectangular form by separately adding their x‐ and y‐components. In
general,
               𝐮 〈𝑢 , 𝑢 〉
                      𝐯       〈𝑣 , 𝑣 〉
                      𝐮       𝐯         〈𝑢 , 𝑢 〉      〈𝑣 , 𝑣 〉         〈𝑢       𝑣 ,𝑢      𝑣 〉

Example 9.18: In the figure at right,
                      𝐮       〈4, 3〉
                      𝐯       〈2, 6〉
                      𝐰           𝐮      𝐯     〈4, 3〉        〈2, 6〉       〈6, 3〉



Vector Algebra
𝐮     𝐯       𝐯       𝐮                                  𝐮       𝐮       𝟎         a∙ 𝐮     𝐯     a∙𝐮     a∙𝐯
  𝐮    𝐯          𝐰       𝐮       𝐰       𝐯              𝟎∙𝐮      𝟎                a   b ∙𝐮       a∙𝐮     b∙𝐮
𝐮     𝟎       𝐮                                          1∙𝐮      𝐮                ab ∙ 𝐮       a∙ b∙𝐮   b∙ a∙𝐮



Scalar Multiplication
Scalar multiplication changes the magnitude of a vector, but not the direction. In general,
                      𝐮       〈𝑢 , 𝑢 〉
                      𝑘∙𝐮             〈𝑘 ∙ 𝑢 , 𝑘 ∙ 𝑢 〉

Example 9.19: In the figure at right,
                      𝐮       〈4, 3〉
                      2∙𝐮              2 ∙ 〈4, 3〉     〈8, 6〉

                                                 Center – the middle of the circle. All points on the circle
                                                 are the same distance from the center.
                                                 Radius – a line segment with one endpoint at the center
                                                 and the other endpoint on the circle. The term “radius” is
                                                 also used to refer to the distance from the center to the

                                                 Diameter – a line segment with endpoints on the circle
                                                 that passes through the center.




   Arc – a path along a circle.
   Minor Arc – a path along the circle that is less than 180⁰.
   Major Arc – a path along the circle that is greater than
   180⁰.
   Semicircle – a path along a circle that equals 180⁰.
   Sector – a region inside a circle that is bounded by two
   radii and an arc.

Circle Vocabulary:
     Subtended angle: an angle whose two rays pass through the
        endpoints of a geometric object (e.g., an arc on a circle).
     An arc subtends an angle. An angle is subtended by an arc.
     In the diagram to the right, AC subtends both ∠𝐴BC and ∠AOC.
        Both ∠𝐴BC and ∠AOC are subtended by AC.
        Naming a circle: Circles are typically named by their centers. In the diagram above, we
         would refer to the circle as Circle O. Typically, the point at the center of a circle is
         named O or a letter close to O in the English alphabet.
        Interior point: a point whose distance from the center of the circle is less than the
         radius of the circle. That is, the point is inside the circle.
        Exterior point: a point whose distance from the center of the circle is more than the
         radius of the circle. That is, the point is outside the circle.
        Central angle: An angle with its vertex at the center of a circle. In the diagram above,
         ∠AOC is a central angle.
        Inscribed angle: An angle with its vertex on a circle and its rays passing through the
         circle. In the diagram above, ∠ABC is an inscribed angle.
        Tangent-chord angle: An angle with its vertex on a circle, one ray tangent to the circle,
         and one ray passing through the circle. In the diagram above, line l is tangent to Circle
         O at Point B. ∠ABD and ∠CBD are tangent-chord angles.
        Circumscribed polygon: A polygon outside a circle, with all of the sides of the polygon
         tangent to the circle. Circumscribed polygons are typically regular (i.e., they have equal
         angle measures and equal side lengths).
        Inscribed polygon: A polygon inside a circle, with all of its vertices on the circle.


Example 10.1: Given: AB ≅ BC and 𝑚∠A 70°, find 𝑚 ABC.
   The top diagram to the right is given with this problem. In order to solve
   the problem, we add a few things to the top diagram to get the bottom
   diagram.
     In the bottom diagram, items in black are given, and items in blue are
     derived as follows:
        𝑚∠C 𝑚∠A          70° because they are opposite congruent sides in a
        triangle.
        𝑚 BC    𝑚 AB     2 ∙ 70°   140° because the arcs subtend angles of 70°.

Facts about Circles
        The circumference of a circle is: 𝐶 𝜋𝑑 2𝜋𝑟, where 𝑑 is the diameter of the circle
         and 𝑟 is the radius of the circle.
        The area of a circle is 𝐶 𝜋𝑟 , where 𝑟 is the radius of the circle.
        A diameter spits a circle into two arcs, each of measure 180°.
        All radii in a circle are congruent. Likewise, all radii in congruent circles are congruent.
        If a quadrilateral is inscribed in a circle, then opposite angles of the quadrilateral are
         supplementary.


Example 10.3: Solve for 𝑥 and 𝑦.
     Opposite angles in a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle add to 180°.
         𝑥     85        180      →    𝒙    𝟏𝟎𝟓

Facts about Chords
        The distance of a chord from the center of a circle is measured from the center of the
         circle to the midpoint of the chord. The radius extending through the midpoint of the
         chord is perpendicular to the chord.
        The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the center of the circle.
        Chords that are the same distance from the center of the same circle or congruent
         circles are congruent.

Example 10.4: A square with area 100 cm is inscribed in a circle. Find the exact value of the
area of the circle.
     If a square has an area of 100, it must have a side length of:
     𝑠        √100         10.
     We create ∆OAB in the diagram to find the radius of Circle O.
     ∆OAB is a 45°-45°-90° triangle with sides of length 5, so the
     hypotenuse, OB                 5√2.

     The radius of the circle is the length of OB. OB                          5√2.
     Finally, the area requested is:

Facts about Tangents
        Tangents to a circle from an external point are congruent.
        A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius of the circle that intersects the
         tangent at the point of tangency.
        If two lines that are tangent to a circle intersect at an external point, then the line
         containing the point of intersection and the center of the circle bisects the angle formed
         by the two tangents.
        All of these facts about tangents are illustrated in the example below.

Perimeter of a Triangle
The perimeter of a triangle is simply the sum of the measures of the three sides of the triangle.

                                  𝑷       𝒂         𝒃     𝒄


Area of a Triangle
There are two formulas for the area of a triangle, depending on what information about the
triangle is available.
Formula 1: The formula most familiar to the student can be used when the base and height of
the triangle are either known or can be determined.
                                          𝟏
                                  𝑨           𝒃𝒉
                                          𝟐
where, 𝑏 is the length of the base of the triangle.
       ℎ is the height of the triangle.

Note: The base can be any side of the triangle. The height is the measure of the altitude of
whichever side is selected as the base. So, you can use:


                                            or                                     or




Formula 2: Heron’s formula for the area of a triangle can be used when
the lengths of all of the sides are known. Sometimes this formula,
though less appealing, can be very useful.

              𝒂, 𝒃, 𝒄 are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

Example 11.1: C, B, D are midpoints. BD              12 cm, DF            11 cm, CD            10.4 cm. Find the
perimeter of ∆𝐴𝐸𝐹.
     The four small triangles formed by connecting midpoints C, B, D are all
     congruent. The perimeter of the ∆𝐴𝐸𝐹 will be double the perimeter
     of any of the four interior triangles.
     We are given the three lengths shown in magenta in the diagram.
     Let’s use the perimeter of ∆𝐷𝐵𝐹 as our basis to calculate the perimeter of ∆𝐴𝐸𝐹.

Example 11.2: Given a triangle with vertices at 1, 4 , 5, 2 ,                          2, 3 , what is the perimeter of
the triangle after dilation? Round to 2 decimals.
     The coordinates of the preimage are 1, 4 , 5, 2 ,                        2, 3 .
     The dilation doubles all 𝑥- values and triples all 𝑦-values. So, the coordinates of the image
     are: 2, 12 , 10, 6 , 4, 9
     Distances:
     From 2, 12 to 10, 6 , the distance is:                    10    2             6       12         √388      19.70.

Coordinate Geometry

If the three vertices of a triangle are displayed in a coordinate plane, the formula below, using a
determinant, will give the area of a triangle.
Let the three points in the coordinate plane be: 𝒙𝟏 , 𝒚𝟏 , 𝒙𝟐 , 𝒚𝟐 , 𝒙𝟑 , 𝒚𝟑 . Then, the area of
the triangle is one half of the absolute value of the determinant below:

                                                  𝒙𝟏       𝒚𝟏   𝟏

Example 11.4: The scale factor of two similar polygons is 5: 2. The perimeter of the larger
polygon is 40 ft and its area is 100 ft . What are the perimeter and area of the smaller
polygon?
     Scale factors and perimeter are both linear measures.
     For perimeter, we have the proportion:             For area, we have the proportion:

Example 11.5: Two similar figures have areas of 80 and 180. Find the ratio of their perimeters:
     Area ratios are the squares of the corresponding linear ratios. Perimeters are linear
     measures. Therefore, we have the proportion:

         Area ratio: 𝑘

     The small figure’s area is in the numerator of the above fraction and the large figure’s area
     is in the denominator of the above fraction. Then,

                                              𝟐

Example 11.6: What is the length of the apothem of a regular
hexagon with side length 12 cm?
     The apothem splits the bottom side of the hexagon in half, i.e.,
     into two segments of length 6.
     Each interior angle in a regular hexagon is 120°, so half of that is
     60°. This gives us a 30°-60°-90° triangle, with one side of the
     triangle being the apothem. We can calculate, then:

     The perimeter of this regular hexagon is:

Example 11.8: What is the area of the kite in the diagram? All measurements are in inches.
We need the lengths of the diagonals of the kite.
The vertical diagonal has length 𝑑           8       8        16.
To find the horizontal diagonal, we need the help of Pythagoras.

Example 11.9: Derive a formula for the area of an equilateral triangle with side length 𝑠.
     Let the height of the equilateral triangle be ℎ. We need to find 𝑏.
     We draw an altitude from the top of the triangle to the base, creating
     a pair of congruent interior triangles. This results in 30°-60°-90°
     triangles, each with base . The length of the height, then, is    √3.
                                                 𝑠
     The length of the whole base is: 2 ∙                𝑠.

Example 11.10: Successive squares are formed by joining the midpoints of each side. If the
outermost square has a side length of 20 m, what is the area of the shaded square?
Notice that we are able to create a 45°-45°-90° triangle in the upper right corner of the
diagram. Working in from the outer square to the next inner square, we see that the side
lengths of the squares shrink by a factor of √2.
     Since the side lengths shrink by a factor of √2, the areas of
     successive squares must shrink by a factor of √2             2.
     The outer square has an area of: 𝐴      20      400 units .
     The shaded square is three squares in from the outer square, so

     The ratio of the areas is the square of the ratio of the linear measures. So, the ratio of

Example 11.18: Two congruent semicircles and a full circle are arranged inside a large
semicircle as shown in the diagram. The radius of the smaller semicircles is 𝑥. The radius of the
full circle is 3. Find the total area of the aqua-colored shaded regions.

First, let’s find 𝑥:
∆𝐴𝐷𝐶 is a right triangle, so using the
Pythagorean Theorem:
    𝐴𝐷         𝐶𝐷            𝐴𝐶
    𝑥         𝐶𝐷           𝑥      3

    𝐶𝐷         6𝑥        9
We also know that 2𝑥 is the radius of the large (outer) semicircle.
Then, on line segment 𝐷𝐸 (also a radius of the large semicircle):
    2𝑥        𝐶𝐷       3
    𝐶𝐷        2𝑥       3
    𝐶𝐷            2𝑥       3          4𝑥       12𝑥     9
Then, set the two expressions for 𝐶𝐷 equal to each other:
    4𝑥        12𝑥          9      6𝑥       9
    4𝑥        18𝑥          0
    2𝑥 2𝑥          9         0
              9
    𝑥    0,
              2
The answer 𝑥               0 makes no sense, so we must have: 𝑥

   A Polyhedron is a 3-dimensional solid bounded by a series
    of polygons.
   Faces are the polygons that bound the polyhedron.
   An Edge is the line segment at the intersection of two faces.
   A Vertex is a point at the intersection of two edges.                                              Edges

   A Convex Polyhedron is one in which all diagonals are contained within the interior of the
    polyhedron. A Concave polyhedron is one that is not convex.
   A Cross Section is the intersection of a plane with the polyhedron.


Euler’s Theorem
Let:     𝐹    the number of faces of a polyhedron.                 Example 12.1: Euler’s Theorem
         𝑉    the number of vertices of a polyhedron.              The cube above has …
         𝐸    the number of edges of a polyhedron.                       6 faces
                                                                         8 vertices
Then, for any polyhedron that does not intersect itself,
                                                                         12 edges

                                                                          𝟔    𝟖    𝟏𝟐    𝟐    

Calculating the Number of Edges
The number of edges of a polyhedron is one-half the number of sides in the polygons it
comprises. Each side that is counted in this way is shared by two polygons; simply adding all
the sides of the polygons, therefore, double counts the number of edges on the polyhedron.
Example 12.2: Consider a soccer ball. It is polyhedron made up of 20
hexagons and 12 pentagons. Then the number of edges is:
              1
         𝑬      ∙ 20 ∙ 6       12 ∙ 5       𝟗𝟎
              2
Note: use of the factor reflects each edge being counted twice in the sides of the polygons.

                                    A Hole in Euler’s Theorem

Topology is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of objects that are preserved
through manipulation that does not include tearing. An object may be stretched, twisted and
otherwise deformed, but not torn. In this branch of mathematics, a donut is equivalent to a
coffee cup because both have one hole; you can deform either the cup or the donut and create
the other, like you are playing with clay.

All of the usual polyhedra have no holes in them, so Euler’s Equation holds. What happens if
we allow the polyhedra to have holes in them? That is, what if we consider topological shapes
different from the ones we normally consider?


Euler’s Characteristic
When Euler’s Equation is rewritten as 𝑭         𝑬    𝑽     𝟐, the left-hand side of the equation is
called the Euler Characteristic.

                        The Euler Characteristic of a shape is:    𝑭     𝑬       𝑽




Generalized Euler’s Theorem
Let:      𝐹   the number of faces of a polyhedron.
          𝑉   the number of vertices of a polyhedron.
          𝐸   the number of edges of a polyhedron.
          𝑔   the number of holes in the polyhedron. 𝑔 is
                called the genus of the shape.

Then, for any polyhedron that does not intersect itself,
                                                                       Example 12.3:

Notice the following patterns in the table:
        All of the numbers of faces are even. Only the cube has a number of faces that is not a
         multiple of 4.
        All of the numbers of vertices are even. Only the octahedron has a number of faces that
         is not a multiple of 4.
        The number of faces and vertices seem to alternate (e.g., cube 6-8 vs. octahedron 8-6).
        All of the numbers of edges are multiples of 6.
        There are only three possibilities for the numbers of edges – 6, 12 and 30.
        The faces are one of: regular triangles, squares or regular pentagons.

Cavalieri’s Principle
If two solids have the same height and the same cross-sectional area at every level, then they
have the same volume. This principle allows us to derive a formula for the volume of an
oblique prism from the formula for the volume of a right prism.

Example 12.4: Find the volume of the triangular prism.
     This is a right prism, with a triangle for a base. First, find 𝐵, the area of
     the triangular base.
            1
         𝐵     12 16        96
            2
     The height is the length perpendicular to the base. So, ℎ             10.
     Finally, 𝑽     𝐵ℎ        96 ∙ 10   𝟗𝟔𝟎


Example 12.5: Find the lateral surface area and the total surface area of the
triangular prism.
     The formula for the surface area of a prism is:
         𝑆𝐴 Ph 2B, where P is the perimeter of the base, h is the height of
         the prism, and B is the area of one base. Ph is also called the lateral
         surface area of the prism.
     The height is the length of a segment perpendicular to the base. So, ℎ             10.
     The base is a triangle, so we need to calculate the length of its hypotenuse in order to
     calculate the perimeter, P. Pythagoras will help us with this; the hypotenuse has length:

         𝑐     12        16       20
     We can now calculate: P            12    16     20     48. Therefore,
         𝑳𝑺𝑨      𝑃∙ℎ      48 ∙ 10      𝟒𝟖𝟎
     The area of one triangular base of the prism is: 𝐵              96 from the prior example.
     The total surface area of the triangular prism, then, is:
         𝑺𝑨    480       2 ∙ 96    𝟔𝟕𝟐.

Sometimes the student is asked to calculate the surface are of a prism that does not quite fit
into one of the categories for which an easy formula exists. In this case, the answer may be to
decompose the prism into its component shapes, and then calculate the areas of the
components. Note: this process also works with cylinders and pyramids.

Decomposition of a Prism
To calculate the surface area of a prism, decompose it and look at each of the prism’s faces
individually.
Example 12.8: Calculate the surface area of the triangular prism:
To do this, first notice that we need the value of the hypotenuse of the
base. Use the Pythagorean Theorem or Pythagorean Triples to
determine the missing value is 10. Then, decompose the figure into its
various faces:




The surface area, then, is calculated as:

Decomposition of a Right Cylinder
Example 12.9: Calculate the surface area of the cylinder:
The cylinder is decomposed into two circles (the bases) and a
rectangle (the lateral face).
The surface area, then, is calculated as:

Pyramids
   A Pyramid is a polyhedron in which the base is a polygon and
    the lateral sides are triangles with a common vertex.
   The Base is a polygon of any size or shape.
   The Lateral Faces are the faces that are not the base.
   The Lateral Edges are the edges between the lateral faces.
   The Apex of the pyramid is the intersection of the lateral
    edges. It is the point at the top of the pyramid.
   The Slant Height of a regular pyramid is the altitude of one of
    the lateral faces.
   The Height is the perpendicular length between the base and the apex.

   A Regular Pyramid is one in which the lateral faces are congruent triangles. The height of a
    regular pyramid intersects the base at its center.
   An Oblique Pyramid is one that is not a right pyramid. That is, the
    apex is not aligned directly above the center of the base.

   The Surface Area of a pyramid is the sum of the areas of all its
    faces.
   The Lateral Area of a pyramid is the sum of the areas of its lateral
    faces.

Example 12.10: Calculate the volume of the square pyramid shown if the
perimeter of the base is 64 and the height is 15.

     For a square pyramid, we introduce a factor of            into the volume
     calculation, relative to a prism. The same factor is used in the
     calculation of a cone, relative to a cylinder. The origins of the         factor
     come from Calculus and the fact that we are working in 3 dimensions.

     If the perimeter of the base is 64, then the length of one base edge is: 64              4     16.
     Our base is a square with area: 𝐵       16     256. ℎ         15.

               3      3


Example 12.11: Calculate the slant height of the face of the square pyramid in
the previous example.
     If we look inside the pyramid, we can see a triangle that has a height of
     length ℎ 15, a leg that is half the length of a base edge of the pyramid
     (16 2 8) and a hypotenuse of the slant height (s). Use the Pythagorean
     Theorem, then, to determine: 𝐬         √15     8      𝟏𝟕



Example 12.12: Calculate the lateral surface area and the total surface area of the square
pyramid in the previous example.
     The formula for the surface area of a square pyramid is:

         𝑆𝐴      Ps   B, where P is the perimeter of the base, s is the slant
         height of the pyramid, and B is the area of the base.           𝑃𝑠 is also
         called the lateral surface area of the pyramid.
     From the previous two examples, we know that P               64 and s         17. Therefore,
                 1          1

                 2          2
     The base length is 16, so the area of the base is: 𝐵         16        256.
     The total surface area of the square pyramid, then, is:

   Center – the middle of the sphere. All points on the sphere
    are the same distance from the center.
   Radius – a line segment with one endpoint at the center and
    the other endpoint on the sphere. The term “radius” is also
    used to refer to the distance from the center to the points
    on the sphere.
   Diameter – a line segment with endpoints on the sphere
    that passes through the center.
   Great Circle – the intersection of a plane and a sphere
    that passes through the center.
   Hemisphere – half of a sphere. A great circle separates a
    plane into two hemispheres.
   Secant Line – a line that intersects the sphere in exactly
    two points.
   Tangent Line– a line that intersects the sphere in exactly
    one point.
   Chord – a line segment with endpoints on the sphere that does not pass through the center.

Example 12.18: Approximate the circumference of the Earth in kilometers and miles.
     Using the radius estimates from the prior example:
     Kilometers: 𝑪          2𝜋𝑟    2𝜋 ∙ 6,364.7065 km      𝟑𝟗, 𝟗𝟗𝟏 𝐤𝐦 or about 40,000 km.
     Miles: 𝑪     2𝜋𝑟        2𝜋 ∙ 3,954.8453 miles      𝟐𝟒, 𝟖𝟒𝟗 𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐤𝐦 or about 25,000 miles.

     Given the accuracy of our starting values, two significant digits in our answers is about the
     best we can hope for. 40,000 km and 25,000 miles are real estimates of the
     circumference of the Earth to two significant digits.

                                         Similar Solids

Similar Solids have equal ratios of corresponding linear measurements (e.g., edges, radii). So,
all of their key dimensions are proportional.




Edges, Surface Area and Volume of Similar Figures
Let k be the scale factor relating two similar geometric solids F1 and F2 such that 𝐅𝟐   𝐤 ∙ 𝐅𝟏 .
Then, for corresponding parts of F1 and F2,

Example 12.20: Two similar icosahedrons have volumes of 250 and 686. Find the ratio of their
surface areas.
     Call the linear ratio between similar objects 𝑘. Then:
     Linear measure : area : volume have relative ratios of 𝑘 ∶ 𝑘 ∶ 𝑘 . To get from a volume
     ratio to a surface area ratio, we need to take the cube root of the volume ratio (to get from
     volume to linear) and square the result (to get from linear to area). Alternatively, we could
     take the 2/3 power of the volume relativities to get the same answer.
