Abstract: This article is the first chapter of the second edition of The Anatomy of Corporate
Law: A Comparative and Functional Approach, by Reinier Kraakman, John Armour, Paul
Davies, Luca Enriques, Henry Hansmann, Gerard Hertig, Klaus Hopt, Hideki Kanda and
Edward Rock (Oxford University Press, 2009). The book as a whole provides a functional
analysis of corporate (or company) law in Europe, the U.S., and Japan. Its organization
reflects the structure of corporate law across all jurisdictions, while individual chapters explore
the diversity of jurisdictional approaches to the common problems of corporate law. In its
second edition, the book has been significantly revised and expanded.

As the book's introductory chapter, this article describes the functions and boundaries of
corporate law. We first detail the economic importance of the corporate form's hallmark
features: legal personality, limited liability, transferable shares, delegated management, and
investor ownership. We then identify the major agency problems that attend the corporate
form, and that, therefore, corporate law must address: conflicts between managers and
shareholders, between controlling and minority shareholders, and between shareholders as a
class and non-shareholder constituencies of the firm such as creditors and employees. In our
view, corporate law serves in part to accommodate contract and property law to the corporate
form and, in substantial part, to address the agency problems that are associated with this
form. We next consider the role of law in structuring corporate affairs so as to achieve these
goals: whether, and to what extent standard forms - as opposed, on the one hand, to private
contract, and on the other, to mandatory rules - are needed, and the role of regulatory
competition. Whilst the ‘core’ features of corporate law are present in all - or almost all - legal
systems, different systems have made different choices regarding the form and content of
many other aspects of their corporate laws. To assist in explaining these, we review a range
of forces that shape the development of corporate law, including domestic share ownership
patterns. These forces operate differently across countries, implying that in some cases,
complementary differences in corporate laws are functional. However, other such differences
may be better explained as a response to purely distributional concerns.

   REINIER KRAAKMAN

1.1 INTRODUCTION
What is the common structure of the law of business corporations—or, as it would be
put in some jurisdictions, company law—across different national jurisdictions?
Although this question is rarely asked by corporate law scholars, it is critically
important for the comparative investigation of corporate law. Recent scholarship often
emphasizes the divergence among European, American, and Japanese corporations in
corporate governance, share ownership, capital markets, and business culture. 1 But,
notwithstanding the very real differences across jurisdictions along these dimensions,
the underlying uniformity of the corporate form is at least as impressive. Business
corporations have a fundamentally similar set of legal characteristics—and face a
fundamentally similar set of legal problems—in all jurisdictions.
         Consider, in this regard, the basic legal characteristics of the business
corporation. To anticipate our discussion below, there are five of these characteristics,
most of which will be easily recognizable to anyone familiar with business affairs.
They are: legal personality, limited liability, transferable shares, delegated
management under a board structure, and investor ownership. These characteristics
respond—in ways we will explore—to the economic exigencies of the large modern
business enterprise. Thus, corporate law everywhere must, of necessity, provide for
them. To be sure, there are other forms of business enterprise that lack one or more
of these characteristics. But the remarkable fact—and the fact that we wish to
stress—is that, in market economies, almost all large-scale business firms adopt a
legal form that possesses all five of the basic characteristics of the business
corporation. Indeed, most small jointly-owned firms adopt this corporate form as well,
although sometimes with deviations from one or more of the five basic characteristics
to fit their special needs.
        It follows that a principal function of corporate law is to provide business
enterprises with a legal form that possesses these five core attributes. By making this
form widely available and user-friendly, corporate law enables entrepreneurs to
transact easily through the medium of the corporate entity, and thus lowers the costs
of conducting business. Of course, the number of provisions that the typical
corporation statute 2 devotes to defining the corporate form is likely to be only a small
part of the statute as a whole. Nevertheless, these are the provisions that comprise the
legal core of corporate law that is shared by every jurisdiction. In this Chapter, we

  We use the term ‘corporation statute’ to refer to the general law that governs corporations, and not to
a corporation’s individual charter (or ‘articles of incorporation’, as that document is sometimes also
called).


                                                   2
briefly explore the contracting efficiencies (some familiar and some not) that
accompany these five features of the corporate form, and that, we believe, have
helped to propel the worldwide diffusion of the corporate form.
        As with corporate law itself, however, our principal focus in this book is not
on establishing the corporate form per se. Rather, it is on a second, equally important
function of corporate law: namely, reducing the ongoing costs of organizing business
through the corporate form. Corporate law does this by facilitating coordination
between participants in corporate enterprise, and by reducing the scope for value-
reducing forms of opportunism among different constituencies. Indeed, much of
corporate law can usefully be understood as responding to three principal sources of
opportunism: conflicts between managers and shareholders, conflicts among
shareholders, and conflicts between shareholders and the corporation’s other
constituencies, including creditors and employees. All three of these generic conflicts
may usefully be characterized as what economists call ‘agency problems.’
Consequently, Chapter 2 examines these three agency problems, both in general and
as they arise in the corporate context, and surveys the range of legal strategies that can
be employed to ameliorate those problems.
        The reader might object that these agency conflicts are not uniquely
‘corporate’. After all, any form of jointly-owned enterprise must expect conflicts
among its owners, managers, and third-party contractors. We agree; insofar as the
corporation is only one of several legal forms for the jointly-owned firm, it faces the
same generic agency problems that confront all jointly-owned firms. Nevertheless, the
characteristics of this particular form matter a great deal, since it is the form that is
chosen by most large-scale enterprises—and, as a practical matter, the only form that
firms with widely dispersed ownership can choose in many jurisdictions. 3 Moreover,
the unique features of this form determine the contours of its agency problems. To
take an obvious example, the fact that shareholders enjoy limited liability—while,
say, general partners in a partnership do not—has traditionally made creditor
protection far more salient in corporate law than it is in partnership law. Similarly, the
fact that corporate investors may trade their shares is the foundation of the
anonymous trading stock market—an institution that has encouraged the separation
of ownership from control, and so has sharpened the management-shareholder
agency problem.
       In this book, we explore the role of corporate law in minimizing agency
problems—and thus, making the corporate form practicable—in the most important
categories of corporate actions and decisions. More particularly, Chapters 3–9
address, respectively, seven categories of transactions and decisions that involve the
corporation, its owners, its managers, and the other parties with whom it deals.
Most of these categories of firm activity are, again, generic, rather than uniquely
corporate. For example, Chapters 3 and 4 address governance mechanisms that
operate over the firm’s ordinary business decisions, whilst Chapter 5 turns to the
checks that operate on the corporation’s transactions with creditors. As before,
however, although similar agency problems arise in similar contexts across all forms of


3
  Only the corporate form is available in many jurisdictions for firms that want access to the capital
markets for equity financing. Some jurisdictions, however, permit the equity of non-corporate entities
to trade in the public markets as well: for example, in the U.S., the equity securities of so-called
‘master’ limited partnerships and limited liability companies may be registered for public trading.


                                                  3
jointly-owned enterprise, the response of corporate law turns in part on the unique
legal features that characterize the corporate form.
         Taken together, the latter seven chapters of our book cover nearly all of the
important problems in corporate law. In each Chapter, we describe how the basic
agency problems of the corporate form manifest themselves in the given category of
corporate activity, and then explore the range of alternative legal responses that are
available. We illustrate these alternative approaches with examples from the corporate
law of various prominent jurisdictions. We explore the patterns of homogeneity and
heterogeneity that appear. Where there are significant differences across
jurisdictions, we seek to address both the sources and the consequences of those
differences. Our examples are drawn principally from a handful of major
representative jurisdictions, including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the
U.S., though we also make reference to the laws of other jurisdictions to make special
points. 4
        In emphasizing a strongly functional approach to the issues of comparative
law, this book differs from some of the more traditional comparative law scholarship,
both in the field of corporate law and elsewhere. 5 We join an emerging tendency in
comparative law scholarship by seeking to give a highly integrated view of the role
and structure of corporate law that provides a clear framework within which to
organize an understanding of individual systems, both alone and in comparison with
each other. 6 Moreover, while comparative law scholarship often has a tendency to
emphasize differences between jurisdictions, our approach is to focus on similarities.
Doing so, we believe, illuminates an underlying commonality of structure that
transcends national boundaries. It also provides an important perspective on the
potential basis for the international integration of corporate law that is likely to take
place as economic activity continues to become more global in scope in the decades to
come.
        We realize that the term ‘functional’, which we have used here and in our title,
means different things to different people, and that some of the uses to which that
term has been put in the past—particularly in the field of sociology—have made the
term justifiably suspect. It would perhaps be more accurate to call our approach
‘economic’ rather than ‘functional,’ though the sometimes tendentious use of
economic argumentation in legal literature to support particular (generally laissez-
faire) policy positions, as well as the tendency in economic analysis to neglect non-
pecuniary motivations or assume an unrealistic degree of rationality in human action,

4
  We focus on developed, rather than developing, economies, because where foundational legal
institutions, such as functioning courts and the protection of property rights, are absent or
compromised, then the way in which corporate law responds to specific problems is less likely to make
a difference to the real economy. A discussion of the ways in which such institutions can be
engendered, or replicated by extra-legal means, is beyond the scope of our enquiry.

have also caused many scholars—particularly outside of the United States—to be as
wary of ‘economic analysis’ as they are of ‘functional analysis.’ For the purposes at
hand, however, we need not commit ourselves on fine points of social science
methodology. We need simply note that the exigencies of commercial activity and
organization present practical problems that have a rough similarity in developed
market economies throughout the world. Our analysis is ‘functional’ in the sense that
we organize discussion around the ways in which corporate laws respond to these
problems, and the various forces that have led different jurisdictions to choose
roughly similar—though by no means always the same—solutions to them.
       That is not to say that our objective here is just to explore the commonality of
corporate law across jurisdictions. Of equal importance, we wish to offer a common
language and a general analytic framework with which to understand the purposes
that can potentially be served by corporate law, and with which to compare and
evaluate the efficacy of different legal regimes in serving those purposes. 7 Indeed, it is
our hope that the analysis offered in this book will be of use not only to students of
comparative law, but also to those who simply wish to have a more solid framework
within which to view their own country’s corporation law.
        Likewise, we take no strong stand here in the current debate on the extent to
which corporate law is or should be ‘converging,’ much less on what it might
converge to. 8 That is a subject on which reasonable minds can differ. Indeed, it is a
subject on which the reasonable minds that have written this book sometimes differ. 9
Rather, we are seeking to set out a conceptual framework and a factual basis with
which that and other important issues facing corporate law can be fruitfully
explored.




7
  In very general terms, our approach echoes that taken by Dean Robert Clark in his important treatise,
CORPORATE LAW (1986), and Frank Easterbrook and Daniel Fischel, in their discussion of U.S. law,
THE ECONOMIC STRUCTURE OF CORPORATE LAW (1991). However, our analysis differs from—and
goes beyond—that offered by these and other commentators in several key respects. First, and most
obviously, we present a comparative analysis that addresses the corporate law of multiple jurisdictions.
Second, we provide an integrated functional overview that stresses the agency problems at the core of
corporate law, rather than focusing on more particular legal institutions and solutions. Finally, we offer
a more expansive account than do other commentators of the functions of central features of the
corporate form such as limited liability and the governance structure of the corporate board. Our
analysis, moreover, is informed not only by a comparative perspective across jurisdictions, but also,
occasionally, by a comparative perspective across legal forms for business enterprise.

1.2 WHAT IS A CORPORATION?
As we noted above, the five core structural characteristics of the business corporation
are: (1) legal personality, (2) limited liability, (3) transferable shares, (4) centralized
management under a board structure, and (5) shared ownership by contributors of
capital. In virtually all economically important jurisdictions, there is a basic statute
that provides for the formation of firms with all of these characteristics. As this
pattern suggests, these characteristics have strongly complementary qualities for
many firms. Together, they make the corporation uniquely attractive for organizing
productive activity. But these characteristics also generate tensions and tradeoffs that
lend a distinctively corporate character to the agency problems that corporate law
must address.

1.2.1 Legal personality
In the economics literature, a firm is often characterized as a ‘nexus of contracts’. As
commonly used, this description is ambiguous. It is often invoked simply to
emphasize that most of the important relationships within a firm—including, in
particular, those among the firm’s owners, managers, and employees—are essentially
contractual in character, and hence based on consent, rather than involving some form
of extracontractual command-and-control authority. This is an important insight, but it
does not distinguish firms from other networks of contractual relationships. It is
perhaps more accurate to describe a firm as a ‘nexus for contracts’, in the sense that a
firm serves, fundamentally, as the common counterparty in numerous contracts with
suppliers, employees, and customers, coordinating the actions of these multiple persons
through exercise of its contractual rights. 10 The first and most important contribution
of corporate law, as of other forms of organizational law, is to permit a firm to serve
this role by permitting the firm to serve as a single contracting party that is distinct
from the various individuals who own or manage the firm. In so doing, it enhances
the ability of these individuals to engage together in joint projects.
        The core element of the firm as a nexus for contracts is what the civil law refers
to as ‘separate patrimony.’ This involves the demarcation of a pool of assets that are
distinct from other assets owned, singly or jointly, by the firm’s owners (the
shareholders), 11 and of which the firm in itself, acting through its designated
managers, is viewed in law as being the owner. The firm’s rights of ownership over
its designated assets include the rights to use the assets, to sell them, and—of
particular importance—to make them available for attachment by its creditors.
Conversely, because these assets are conceived as belonging to the firm, rather than
the firm’s owners, they are unavailable for attachment by the personal creditors of
these persons. The core function of this separate patrimony has been termed ‘entity




10
   The characterization of a firm as a ‘nexus of contracts’ originates with Michael Jensen and William
Meckling, Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure, 3
JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS 305 (1976), building on Armen Alchian and Harold Demsetz,
Production, Information Costs, and Economic Organization, 62 AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW 777
(1972).
11
   We use the term ‘owners’ simply to refer to the group who have the entitlement to control the firm’s
assets.


                                                  6
shielding,’ to emphasize that it involves shielding the assets of the entity—the
corporation—from the creditors of the entity’s owners. 12
         Where corporations are concerned, entity shielding involves two relatively
distinct rules of law. The first is a priority rule that grants to creditors of the firm, as
security for the firm’s debts, a claim on the firm’s assets that is prior to the claims of
the personal creditors of the firm’s owners. This rule is shared by all modern legal
forms for enterprise organization, including partnerships. 13 The consequence of this
priority rule is that a firm’s assets are, as a default rule of law, 14 automatically made
available for the enforcement of contractual liabilities entered into in the name of the
firm. 15 By thus bonding the firm’s contractual commitments, the rule makes these
commitments credible.
        The second component of entity shielding—a rule of ‘liquidation
protection’—provides that the individual owners of the corporation (the shareholders)
cannot withdraw their share of firm assets at will, thus forcing partial or complete
liquidation of the firm, nor can the personal creditors of an individual owner foreclose
on the owner’s share of firm assets. 16 This liquidation protection rule serves to protect
the going concern value of the firm against destruction either by individual
shareholders or their creditors. 17 In contrast to the priority rule just mentioned, it is
not found in some other standard legal forms for enterprise organization, such as the
partnership. 18 Legal entities, such as the business corporation, that are characterized
by both these rules—priority for business creditors and liquidation protection—can
therefore be thought of as having ‘strong form’ entity shielding, as opposed to the
‘weak form’ entity shielding found in partnerships, which are characterized only by
the priority rule and not by liquidation protection.
        For a firm to serve effectively as a contracting party, two other types of rules
are also needed. First, there must be rules specifying to third parties the individuals
who have authority to buy and sell assets in the name of the firm, and to enter into
contracts that are bonded by those assets. 19 Whilst of course participants in a firm are
free to specify the delegation of authority by contract amongst themselves,

12
   The term ‘entity shielding’ derives from Henry Hansmann, Reinier Kraakman and Richard Squire,
Law and the Rise of the Firm, 119 HARVARD LAW REVIEW 1333 (2006). The centrality of entity
shielding to organizational law is explored in Henry Hansmann and Reinier Kraakman, The Essential
Role of Organizational Law, 110 YALE LAW JOURNAL 387 (2000), where the attribute was labelled
‘affirmative asset partitioning’.
13
   While even unregistered common law partnerships are subject to this priority rule, the civil law
recognizes a class of unregistered ‘partnerships’ that lack this rule of priority. In effect, such
partnerships are just special forms for co-ownership of assets rather than distinct entities for purposes
of contracting.
14
   On default rules, see Section 1.4.1 infra.
15
   The effect is the same as if the firm’s owners had themselves entered into a joint contract and granted
non-recourse security over certain personal assets to the counterparty, as opposed to transferring those
assets to the corporate patrimony, and then procuring the company to enter into the contract.

   However, it is possible in many jurisdictions to effect liquidation protection by agreement amongst
the owners of a partnership.

background rules are needed—beyond such contractual agreement—to deal with
situations where agents induce third parties to rely on the mere appearance of their
authority. Such rules differ according to organizational form. The particular rules of
authority that characterize the corporation are treated below as a separate core
characteristic, ‘delegated management’. They provide that a board of directors, as
opposed to individual owners, has power to bind the company in contract. 20
        Second, there must be rules specifying the procedures by which both the firm
and its counterparties can bring lawsuits on the contracts entered into in the name of
the firm. Corporations are subject to rules that make such suits easy to bring as a
procedural matter. In particular, they eliminate any need to name, or serve notice on,
the firm’s individual owners—procedures that characterize the rules of suit that, for
example, characterized the Anglo-American partnership until the late 19th century.
        The outcomes achieved by each of these three types of rules—entity shielding,
authority, and procedure—require dedicated legal doctrines to be effective, in the sense
that, absent such doctrine, they could not feasibly be replicated simply by contracting
among a business’s owners and their suppliers and customers. Entity shielding
doctrine is needed to create common expectations, among a firm and its various
present and potential creditors, concerning the effect that a contract between a firm
and one of its creditors will have on the security available to the firm’s other
creditors. 21 Rules governing the allocation of authority are needed to establish
common expectations as to who has authority to transfer rights relating to corporate
assets prior to entering into a contract for their transfer. 22 And procedures for
lawsuits need to be specified by the state, whose third-party authority is invoked by
those procedures. This need for special rules of law distinguishes these three types of
rules from the other basic elements of the corporate form discussed here, which could
in theory be crafted by contract even if the law did not provide for a standard form
of enterprise organization that embodies them. 23
        The concept of the ‘separate legal personality’ of the corporation, as
understood in the legal literature, is in our terms a convenient heuristic formula for
describing organizational forms which enjoy the benefit of each of the three foregoing
‘foundational’ rule types. Starting from the premise that the company is itself a
person, in the eyes of the law, it is straightforward to deduce that it should be capable
of entering into contracts and owning its own property; capable of delegating
authority to agents; and capable of suing and being sued in its own name. For
expository convenience, we use the term ‘legal personality’ to refer to organizational

20
   Associated rules—such as the doctrine of ultra vires—may also prescribe limits as to the extent to
which the board may bind the company in contract.
21
   To establish the priority of business creditors by contract, a firm’s owners would have to contract with
its business creditors to include subordination provisions, with respect to business assets, in all
contracts between individual owners and individual creditors. Not only would such provisions be
cumbersome to draft and costly to monitor, but they would be subject to a high degree of moral
hazard—an individual owner could breach her promise to subordinate the claims of her personal
creditors on the firm’s assets with impunity, since this promise would be unenforceable against personal
creditors who were not party to the bargain. See Hansmann and Kraakman, supra note 12, at 407–9.
22
   To leave questions of authority to be determined simply by agreement between the owners of the
firm will make it costly for parties wishing to deal with the firm to discover whether authority has in
fact been granted in relation to any particular transaction. Authority rules must therefore trade off
contracting parties’ ‘due diligence’ costs against preserving flexibility for owners to customize their
allocations of authority. See Armour and Whincop, supra note 19, at 442–7.

forms—such as the corporation—which share these three attributes. However, we
should make clear that legal personality in the lawyer’s sense is not in itself an
attribute that is a necessary precondition for the existence of any—or indeed all—of
these rules, 24 but merely a handy label for a package that conveniently bundles them
together. Moreover, although it is common in the legal literature to extend syllogistic
deduction from the premise of legal personality to the existence of characteristics
beyond the three foundational features we have described in this section, we see no
functional rationale that compels this.

1.2.2 Limited liability
The corporate form effectively imposes a default term in contracts between a firm and
its creditors whereby the creditors are limited to making claims against assets that are
held in the name of (‘owned by’) firm itself, and have no claim against assets that the
firm’s shareholders hold in their own names. This rule of ‘limited liability’ has not,
historically, always been associated with the corporate form. Some important
corporate jurisdictions long made unlimited shareholder liability for corporate debts
the governing rule. 25 Nevertheless, today limited liability has become a nearly
universal feature of the corporate form. This evolution indicates strongly the value of
limited liability as a contracting tool and financing device.
        Limited liability is a (strong) form of ‘owner shielding’ that is effectively the
converse of the ‘entity shielding’ described above as a component of legal
personality. 26 Entity shielding protects the assets of the firm from the creditors of the
firm’s owners, while limited liability protects the assets of the firm’s owners from the
claims of the firm’s creditors. Together, they set up a regime of ‘asset partitioning’
whereby business assets are pledged as security to business creditors, while the
personal assets of the business’s owners are reserved for the owners’ personal
creditors. (By ‘creditors’ we mean here, broadly, all persons who have a contractual
claim on the firm, including employees, suppliers, and customers.) This partitioning
can increase the value of both types of assets as security for debt. Creditors of the firm
commonly have a comparative advantage in evaluating and monitoring the value of
the firm’s assets, while an owner’s personal creditors are likely to have a comparative
advantage in evaluating and monitoring the individual’s personal assets. As a
consequence, corporate-type asset partitioning can reduce the overall cost of
capital to the firm and its owners.
        A related aspect of asset partitioning is that it permits firms to isolate different
lines of business for the purpose of obtaining credit. By separately incorporating, as
subsidiaries, distinct ventures or lines of business, the assets associated with each

24
   Thus, a common law partnership, which is commonly said by lawyers to lack legal personality, can
under English law enjoy each of the three foundational features described in this section: see §§ 31, 33,
39 Partnership Act 1890 (UK); Armour and Whincop, supra note 19, at 460–1; Burnes v. Pennell
(1849) 2 HL Cas 497, 521; 9 ER 1181, 1191; PD 7, para. 5A Civil Procedure Rules (UK).
25
   Limited liability did not become a standard feature of the English law of joint stock companies until
the mid-19th century, and in the American state of California shareholders bore unlimited personal
liability for corporation obligations until 1931. See Paul L. Davies, GOWER AND DAVIES’ PRINCIPLES
OF MODERN COMPANY LAW 40–6 (6th ed., 1997); Phillip Blumberg, Limited Liability and Corporate
Groups, 11 JOURNAL OF CORPORATE LAW 573 (1986).
26
   The term comes from Hansmann, Kraakman and Squire, supra note 12. Note that the owner
shielding established by a rule of limited liability is less fundamental than entity shielding, in the
sense that it can be achieved by contract, without statutory fiat. Id.; Hansmann and Kraakman,
supra note 12.


                                                   9
venture can conveniently be pledged as security just to the creditors who deal with
that venture. 27 Those creditors are commonly well positioned to assess and keep track
of the value of those assets, but may have little ability to monitor the parent firm’s
other ventures.
        By virtue of asset partitioning—entity shielding and limited liability—the
formation of corporations and subsidiary corporations can also be used as a means of
sharing the risks of transactions with the firm’s creditors, in situations in which the
latter are in a better position to identify or bear those risks in relation to the assets
shielded by the corporate form. Thus, use of the corporate form can assist in raising
debt finance even in situations where there is no need to raise additional equity
capital, as in the case of the parent company of a wholly owned subsidiary. 28
        Asset partitioning also permits flexibility in the allocation of risk and return
between equity-holders and debt-holders, greatly simplifies the administration of
both business and individual bankruptcy, and—by isolating the value of the firm
from the personal financial affairs of the firm’s owners—facilitates tradability of the
firm’s shares, which is the third characteristic of the corporate form. 29
        Finally, asset partitioning, and limited liability in particular, plays an
important function—but more subtle and less often remarked—in facilitating
delegated management, which is the fourth of the core characteristics of the
corporate form. In effect, by shifting downside business risk from shareholders to
creditors, limited liability enlists creditors as monitors of the firm’s managers, a task
which they may be in a better position to perform than are the shareholders in a firm in
which share ownership is widely dispersed.30
        We should emphasize that, when we refer to limited liability, we mean
specifically limited liability in contract—that is, limited liability to creditors who have
contractual claims on the corporation. The compelling reasons for limited liability in
contract generally do not extend to limited liability in tort—that is, to persons who
are unable to adjust the terms on which they extend credit to the corporation, such as
third parties who have been injured as a consequence of the corporation’s negligent
behavior. 31 Limited liability to such persons is arguably not a necessary feature of
the corporate form, and perhaps not even a socially valuable one, as we discuss more
thoroughly in Chapter 5.

1.2.3 Transferable shares

27
   Conversely, asset partitioning can also be used to reduce transparency as to the location of assets.
This concern underlies an important part of corporate law’s creditor-oriented rules: see infra 5.2.1.3.
28
   See, e.g., Richard Posner, The Rights of Creditors of Affiliated Corporations, 43 UNIVERSITY OF
C HICAGO L AW R EVIEW 499 (1976); Henry Hansmann and Reinier Kraakman, Toward
Unlimited Shareholder Liability for Corporate Torts, 100 Y ALE L AW J OURNAL 1879 (1991).
29
   Whilst strong form entity shielding seems essential for free tradability of shares (see Hansmann and
Kraakman, supra note 12), limited liability does not: so long as shareholder liability for a firm’s debts
is pro rata rather than joint and several, free tradability of shares is feasible with unlimited personal
shareholder liability for corporate debts (see Hansmann and Kraakman, supra note 28).

Performing Companies?, 10 JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION 209, 225–7 (2001); Hansmann
and Kraakman, supra note 12.
31
   This category of ‘non-adjusting’ creditors might include some persons whose relationship with the
firm is, in formal terms, contractual. Cf. Lucian Ayre Bebchuk and Jesse M. Fried, The Uneasy Case
for the Priority of Secured Claims in Bankruptcy, 105 YALE LAW JOURNAL 857, at 885–6 (1996).


                                                  10
Fully transferable shares in ownership are yet another basic characteristic of the
business corporation that distinguishes the corporation from the partnership and
various other standard-form legal entities. Transferability permits the firm to conduct
business uninterruptedly as the identity of its owners changes, thus avoiding the
complications of member withdrawal that are common among, for example,
partnerships, cooperatives, and mutuals. 32 This in turn enhances the liquidity of
shareholders’ interests and makes it easier for shareholders to construct and maintain
diversified investment portfolios.
       Fully transferable shares do not necessarily mean freely tradable shares. Even
if shares are transferable, they may not be tradable without restriction in public
markets, but rather just transferable among limited groups of individuals or with the
approval of the current shareholders or of the corporation. Free tradability maximizes
the liquidity of shareholdings and the ability of shareholders to diversify their
investments. It also gives the firm maximal flexibility in raising capital. For these
reasons, all jurisdictions provide for free tradability for at least one class of
corporation. However, free tradability can also make it difficult to maintain
negotiated arrangements for sharing control and participating in management.
Consequently, all jurisdictions also provide mechanisms for restricting transferability.
Sometimes this is done by means of a separate statute, while other jurisdictions
simply provide for restraints on transferability as an option under a general
corporation statute.
         As a matter of terminology, we will refer to corporations with freely tradable
shares as ‘open’ or ‘public’ corporations, and we will correspondingly use the terms
‘closed’ or ‘private’ corporations to refer to corporations that have restrictions on the
tradability of their shares. In addition to this general division, two other distinctions
are important. First, the shares of open corporations may be listed for trading on an
organized securities exchange, in which case we will refer to the firm as a ‘listed’ or
‘publicly-traded’ corporation, in contrast to an ‘unlisted’ corporation. Second, a
company’s shares may be held by a small number of individuals whose interpersonal
relationships are important to the management of the firm, in which case we refer to it
as ‘closely held’, as opposed to ‘widely held’. It is common to speak, loosely, as if all
companies can be categorized as either ‘public’ or ‘close’ corporations, bundling
these distinctions together (and the widely-used term ‘close corporation’ itself
embodies this ambiguity, being used sometimes to mean ‘closed corporation,’
sometimes to mean ‘closely-held corporation,’ and sometimes to mean both). But not
all companies with freely-tradable shares in fact have widely-held share ownership, or
are listed on securities exchanges. Conversely, it is common in some jurisdictions to
find corporations whose shares are not freely tradable but that nonetheless have
hundreds or thousands of shareholders, and that consequently have little in common
with a typical closely-held corporation that has only a handful of shareholders, some
or all of whom are from the same family.
        Transferability of shares, as we have already suggested, is closely connected
both with the liquidation protection that is a feature of strong form legal
personality, and with limited liability. Absent either of these rules, the
creditworthiness of the firm as a whole could change, perhaps fundamentally, as the
identity of its shareholders changed. Consequently, the value of shares would be


32
     See Henry Hansmann, THE OWNERSHIP OF ENTERPRISE 152–5 (1996).


                                              11
difficult for potential purchasers to judge. 33 Perhaps more importantly, a seller of
shares could impose negative or positive externalities on his fellow shareholders
depending on the wealth of the person to whom he chose to sell. It is therefore not
surprising that strong form legal personality, limited liability, and transferable shares
tend to go together, and are all features of the standard corporate form everywhere.
This is in contrast to the conventional general partnership, which lacks all of these
features.

1.2.4 Delegated management with a board structure
Standard legal forms for enterprise organization differ in their allocation of control
rights, including the authority to bind the firm to contracts (discussed above), the
authority to exercise the powers granted to the firm by its contracts, and the authority
to direct the uses made of assets owned by the firm. 34 As a default rule, the general
partnership form grants power to a majority of partners to manage the firm in the
ordinary course of business; more fundamental decisions require unanimity. Both
aspects of this allocation are unworkable for business corporations with numerous and
constantly changing owners. Consequently, corporate law typically vests principal
authority over corporate affairs in a board of directors or similar committee organ
that is periodically elected, exclusively or primarily, by the firm’s shareholders. More
specifically, business corporations are distinguished by a governance structure in
which all but the most fundamental decisions are delegated to a board of directors
that has four basic features.35
        First, the board is, at least as a formal matter, separate from the operational
managers of the corporation. The nature of this separation varies according to whether
the board has one or two tiers. In two-tier boards, top corporate officers occupy the
board’s second (managing) tier, but are generally absent from the first (supervisory)
tier, which is at least nominally independent from the firm’s hired officers (i.e. from
the firm’s senior managerial employees). In single-tier boards, in contrast, hired
officers may be members of, and even dominate, the board itself. Regardless of the
actual allocation of power between a firm’s directors and officers, the legal
distinction between them formally divides all corporate decisions that do not require
shareholder approval into those requiring approval by the board of directors and
those that can be made by the firm’s hired officers on their own authority. This
formal distinction between the board and hired officers facilitates a separation

33
   Paul Halpern, Michael Trebilcock and Stuart Turnbull, An Economic Analysis of Limited Liability in
Corporation Law, 30 UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL 117, 136–8 (1980).
34
   We have already observed that an important precondition for a firm to serve as a nexus for contracts
is a rule designating, for the benefit of third parties, the individuals who have authority to enter into
contracts that bind the firm and its assets (supra, text accompanying notes 19–20). Because there is
often overlap in practice between the scope of such external authority and the internal division of
power to control assets, the latter, unlike the former, cannot be based purely on agreement between
participants in the firm, but rather must be designated to some degree by rules of law. Because the
underlying problem is one of notice to third parties, the law governing closely-held firms often leaves
these matters to be designated at will in the firm’s charter, while for widely-held firms, in which it is
advantageous to let public shareholders and creditors know the allocation of authority without having
to read the charter, the law is generally more rigid in designating the allocation of authority.
35
   This is not to say that other legal entities, such as partnerships, business trusts, or limited liability
companies, cannot have a board structure similar to that of a typical corporation; in fact, they often do.
But those forms, unlike the corporation form, do not presume a board of directors as a matter of law.
Consequently, they bear the burden of placing third parties on notice that authority to commit the firm
differs from the pattern established by the law as a default rule.


                                                    12
between, on the one hand, initiation and execution of business decisions, which is the
province of hired officers, and on the other hand the monitoring and ratification of
decisions, and the hiring of the officers themselves, which are the province of the
board. That separation serves as a useful check on the quality of decision-making by
hired officers. 36 It also performs the key function—noted earlier—of permitting third
parties to rely on a well-defined institution to formally bind the firm in its
transactions with outsiders.
        Second, the board of a corporation is elected—at least in substantial part—by
the firm’s shareholders. The obvious utility of this approach is to help assure that the
board remains responsive to the interests of the firm’s owners, who bear the costs and
benefits of the firm’s decisions and whose interests, unlike those of other corporate
constituencies, are not strongly protected by contract. This requirement of an elected
board distinguishes the corporate form from other legal forms, such as nonprofit
corporations or business trusts, that permit or require a board structure, but do not
require election of the board by the firm’s (beneficial) owners.
       Third, though largely or entirely chosen by the firm’s shareholders, the board
is formally distinct from them. This separation economizes on the costs of decision-
making by avoiding the need to inform the firm’s ultimate owners and obtain their
consent for all but the most fundamental decisions regarding the firm. It also permits
the board to serve as a mechanism for protecting the interests of minority shareholders
and other corporate constituencies, in ways we will explore in Chapter 4.
        Fourth, the board ordinarily has multiple members. This structure—as
opposed, for example, to a structure concentrating authority in a single trustee, as in
many private trusts—facilitates mutual monitoring and checks idiosyncratic decision-
making. However, there are exceptions. Many corporation statutes permit business
planners to dispense with a collective board in favor of a single general director or
one-person board 37 —the evident reason being that, for a very small corporation, most
of the board’s legal functions, including its service as shareholder representative and
focus of liability, can be discharged effectively by a single elected director who also
serves as the firm’s principal manager.

1.2.5 Investor ownership
There are two key elements in the ownership of a firm, as we use the term
‘ownership’ here: the right to control the firm, and the right to receive the firm’s net
earnings. The law of business corporations is principally designed to facilitate the
organization of investor-owned firms—that is, firms in which both elements of
ownership are tied to investment of capital in the firm. More specifically, in an
investor-owned firm, both the right to participate in control—which generally
involves voting in the election of directors and voting to approve major transactions—
and the right to receive the firm’s residual earnings, or profits, are typically
proportional to the amount of capital contributed to the firm. Business corporation

36
     See Eugene Fama and Michael Jensen, Agency Problems and Residual Claims, 26 JOURNAL OF LAW
AND ECONOMICS 327 (1983).
37
   This is true not only of most statutes designed principally for nonpublic corporations, such as
France’s SARL (Art. L. 223-18 Code de Commerce) and SAS (Art. L. 227-6 Code de Commerce) and
Germany’s GmbH (§ 6 GmbH-Gesetz), but also of the general corporate laws in the UK (§ 154(1)
Companies Act 2006), in Italy (Article 2380-2 Civil Code), and in the U.S. state of Delaware, § 141(b)
Delaware General Corporation Law.


                                                 13
statutes universally provide for this allocation of control and earnings as the default
rule.
        There are other forms of ownership that play an important role in
contemporary economies, and other bodies of organizational law—including other
bodies of corporate law—that are specifically designed to facilitate the formation of
those other types of firms. 38 For example, cooperative corporation statutes— which
provide for all of the four features of the corporate form just described except for
transferable shares, and often permit the latter as an option as well— allocate voting
power and shares in profits proportionally to acts of patronage, which may be the
amount of inputs supplied to the firm (in the case of a producer cooperative), or the
amount of the firm’s products purchased from the firm (in the case of a consumer
cooperative). Indeed, business corporations are effectively a special kind of producer
cooperative, in which control and profits are tied to supply of a particular type of
input, namely capital. As a consequence, business corporations could, in principle,
be formed under a well-designed general cooperative corporation statute. But the law
provides, instead, a special statutory form for corporations owned by investors of
capital (‘capital cooperatives,’ as we might think of them). 39
        This specialization follows from the dominant role that investor-owned firms
have come to play in contemporary economies, and the consequent advantages of
having a form that is specialized to the particular needs of such firms, and that signals
clearly to all interested parties the particular character of the firm with which they are
dealing. The dominance of investor ownership among large firms, in turn, reflects
several conspicuous efficiency advantages of that form. One is that, among the
various participants in the firm, investors are often the most difficult to protect
simply by contractual means. 40 Another is that investors of capital have (or, through
the design of their shares, can be induced to have) highly homogeneous interests among
themselves, hence reducing—though definitely not eliminating—the potential for
costly conflict among those who share governance of the firm. 41
        Specialization to investor ownership is yet another respect in which the law of
business corporations differs from the law of partnership. The partnership form
typically does not presume that ownership is tied to contribution of capital, and
though it is often used in that fashion, it is also commonly used to assign ownership
of the firm in whole or in part to contributors of labor or of other factors of
production—as in partnerships of lawyers and other service professionals, or simply
in the prototypical two-person partnership in which one partner supplies labor and
the other capital. As a consequence, the business corporation is less flexible than the
partnership in terms of assigning ownership. To be sure, with sufficient special
contracting and manipulation of the form, ownership shares in a business
corporation can be granted to contributors of labor or other factors of production, or
in proportion to consumption of the firm’s services. Moreover, as the corporate form
has evolved, it has achieved greater flexibility in assigning ownership, either by

   For a discussion of the varieties of forms of ownership found in contemporary economies, of their
respective economic roles, and of the relationship between these forms and the different bodies of
organizational law that govern them, see Hansmann, supra note 32.
39
   Cooperative corporation statutes, in turn, commonly prohibit the grant of ownership shares— voting rights and rights to
a share of profits—to persons who simply contribute capital to the firm, thus preventing the formation of investor-owned
firms under the cooperative corporation statutes.

   See, e.g., Oliver Williamson, Corporate Governance, 93 YALE LAW JOURNAL 1197 (1984).

   See Hansmann, supra note 32, Ch. 4.

permitting greater deviation from the default rules in the basic corporate form (e.g.,
through restrictions on share ownership or transfer), or by developing a separate and
more adaptable form for close corporations. Nevertheless, the default rules of
corporate law are generally designed for investor ownership, and deviation from
this pattern can be awkward. The complex arrangements for sharing rights to
earnings, assets, and control between entrepreneurs and investors in high-tech start-
up firms offer a familiar example. 42
        Sometimes corporate law itself deviates from the assumption of investor
ownership to permit or require that persons other than investors of capital— for
example, creditors or employees—participate to some degree in either control or net
earnings or both. Worker codetermination is a conspicuous example. The wisdom and
means of providing for such non-investor participation in firms that are otherwise
investor-owned remains one of the basic controversies in corporate law. We address
this subject further in Chapter 4.
        Most jurisdictions also have one or more statutory forms—such as the U.S.
nonprofit corporation, the civil law foundation and association, and the UK
company limited by guarantee—that provide for formation of nonprofit firms. These
are firms in which no person may participate simultaneously in both the right to
control and the right to residual earnings (which is to say, the firms have no owners).
While nonprofit organizations, like cooperatives, are sometimes labelled
‘corporations,’ however, they will not be within the specific focus of our attention
here. Thus, when we use the term ‘corporation’ in this book, we refer only to the
business corporation, and not to other types of incorporated entities. When there is
potential for ambiguity, we will explicitly use the term ‘business corporation’ to make
specific reference to the investor-owned company that is our principal focus.

1.3 SOURCES OF CORPORATE LAW
All jurisdictions with well-developed market economies have a least one core statute
that establishes a basic corporate form with the five characteristics described above,
and that is designed particularly to permit the formation of public corporations—that
is, corporations with freely tradable shares. Nevertheless, corporate law as we
understand it here generally extends well beyond the bounds of this core statute.

1.3.1 Special and partial corporate forms
First, major jurisdictions commonly have at least one distinct statutory form
specialized for the formation of closed corporations. These forms—the French SARL,
the German GmbH, the Italian Srl, Japanese close corporation, the American close
corporation and (more recent) limited liability company, and the UK private
company 43 —typically exhibit all of the canonical features of the corporate form. They
differ from open companies chiefly because their shares, though transferable at least
in principle, are presumed—and in some cases required—not to trade freely in a
public market. Sometimes these forms also permit departure from one of our five core
characteristics—delegated management—by permitting elimination of the board in

42
   Stephen N. Kaplan and Per Strömberg, Financial Contracting Theory Meets the Real World: An Empirical Analysis
of Venture Capital Contracts, 70 R EVIEW OF E CONOMIC S TUDIES 281 (2003).
43
   In the case of the UK private company, the standard form is provided not by a separate statute, but by
a range of provisions in a single statute with differential application to public and private companies.


                                                      15
favor of direct management by shareholders. 44 The statutes creating these forms also
commonly permit, and sometimes facilitate, special allocations of control, earnings
rights, and rights to employment among shareholders that go beyond those permitted
in the core public corporation statute.
        Second, some jurisdictions have, in addition to these special closed
corporation forms, quasi-corporate statutory forms that can be used to form business
corporations with all of our five core characteristics, though some of these
characteristics must be added by contract. One example is the limited liability
partnership, which has been provided for recently in the law of the U.S. and some
European jurisdictions. This form simply grafts limited liability onto the traditional
general partnership. U.S. law now allows the partnership to have something close to
strong form entity shielding (by limiting the rights of partners or their creditors to
force liquidation). 45 Consequently, with appropriate governance provisions in the
partnership agreement, it is effectively possible to create a closed corporation as a
limited liability partnership.
         Another example is offered by the U.S. statutory business trust. The statutory
business trust provides for (unambiguous) strong form legal personality and limited
liability, but leaves all elements of internal organization to be specified in the
organization’s governing instrument (charter), failing even to provide statutory default
rules for most such matters. 46 With appropriate charter provisions, a statutory
business trust can be made the equivalent of a public corporation, with the trust’s
beneficiaries in the role of shareholders.
       The analysis we offer in this book extends to all these special and quasi-
corporate forms insofar as they display the five core corporate characteristics.

1.3.2 Other bodies of law
There are bodies of law that, at least in some jurisdictions, are embodied in statutes or
decisional law that are separate from the core corporation statutes, and from the
special and quasi-corporation statutes just described, but that are nonetheless
concerned with particular core characteristics of the corporate form as we define them
here. Insofar as they are so concerned, we view them functionally as part of corporate
law.
         To begin, the German law of groups, or Konzernrecht, qualifies limited
liability and limits the discretion of boards of directors in corporations that are
closely related through cross ownership, seeking to protect the creditors and minority
shareholders of corporations with controlling shareholders. Although the
Konzernrecht—described in more detail in Chapters 5 and 6—is embodied in
statutory and decisional law that is formally distinct from the corporation statutes, it is
clearly an integral part of German corporate law. Similarly, the statutory rules in
many jurisdictions that require employee representation on a corporation’s board of
directors—such as, conspicuously, the German law of codetermination—qualify as
elements of corporate law, even though they occasionally originate outside the


44
   See supra, note 37.
45
   See Hansmann, Kraakman and Squire, supra note 12, at 1391–4.
46
   It differs from the common law private trust, from which it evolved, principally in providing
unambiguously for limited liability for the trust’s beneficiaries even if they exercise control.


                                              16
principal corporate law statutes, because they impose a detailed structure of
employee participation on the boards of directors of large corporations.
        Securities laws in many jurisdictions, including conspicuously the U.S., have
strong effects on corporate governance through rules mandating disclosure and
sometimes, as well, regulating sale and resale of corporate securities, mergers and
acquisitions, and corporate elections. Stock exchange rules, which can regulate
numerous aspects of the internal affairs of exchange-listed firms, can also serve as an
additional source of corporate law, as can other forms of self-regulation, such as the
UK’s City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. 47 These supplemental sources of law are
necessarily part of the overall structure of corporate law, and we shall be concerned
here with all of them.
         There are many constraints imposed on companies by bodies of law designed
to serve objectives that are, in general, independent of the form taken by the
organizations they affect. While we will not explore these bodies in general, we will
sometimes discuss them where they are specifically tailored for the corporate form in
ways that have important effects on corporate structure and conduct. Bankruptcy
law—- or ‘insolvency law,’ as it is termed in some jurisdictions—is an example.
Bankruptcy effects a shift in the ownership of the firm from one group of investors to
another—from shareholders to creditors. By providing creditors with an ultimate
sanction against defaulting firms, it casts a shadow over firms’ relations with their
creditors, and affects the extent to which creditors may need generalized protections
in corporate law. We thus consider the role of bankruptcy law in Chapter 5. Tax law
also affects directly the internal governance of corporations at various points; the U.S.
denial of deductibility from corporate income, for tax purposes, of executive
compensation in excess of $1 million unless it is in the form of incentive pay, discussed
in Chapter 3, is a clear example. 48 And, beyond providing for board representation of
employees, labor law in some countries—as emphasized in Chapter 4—involves
employees or unions in the corporate decision-making process, as in requirements that
works councils or other workers’ organs be consulted prior to taking specified types of
actions.

1.4 LAW VERSUS CONTRACT IN CORPORATE AFFAIRS
The relationships among the participants in a corporation are, to an important degree,
contractual. The principal contract that binds them is the corporation’s charter (or
‘articles of association’ or ‘constitution,’ as it is termed in some jurisdictions). The
charter sets out the basic terms of the relationship among the firm’s shareholders, and
between the shareholders and the firm’s directors and other managers. 49 By explicit or

47
   We term such self-regulation a source of ‘law’ in part because it is commonly supported, directly or
indirectly, by law in the narrow sense. The self-regulatory authority of the American stock
exchanges, for example, is both reinforced and constrained by the U.S. Securities Exchange Act and
the administrative rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under that Act.
Similarly, the authority of the UK’s Takeover Panel was supported indirectly until 2006 by the
recognition that if its rulings were not observed, formal regulation would follow. Since 2006, it has
been directly supported by formal statutory authority in 2006 (Part 28 Companies Act 2006 (UK)), and
so is no longer, strictly speaking, ‘self-regulatory’.
48
   § 162(m) Internal Revenue Code.
49
    The charter may be supplemented by a separate set of bylaws, which commonly govern less
fundamental matters and are subject to different—generally more flexible—amendment rules than is
the charter.


                                                 17
implicit reference, the charter can also become part of the contract between the firm
and its employees or creditors. Some or all of a corporation’s shareholders may, in
addition, be bound by one or more shareholders’ agreements.
        At the same time, corporations are the subject of the large body of law whose
various sources we have just reviewed. That body of law is the principal focus of this
book. Before examining the details of that law, however, we must address a
fundamental—and surprisingly difficult—question: What role does this law play? As
we have already seen, with the exception of legal personality, the defining elements of
the corporate form could in theory be established simply by contract. And the same is
true of most of the other rules of law that we examine throughout this book. If those
rules of law did not exist, the relationships they establish could still be created by
means of contract, just by placing similar provisions in the organization’s charter.
This was, in fact, the approach taken by the numerous unincorporated joint stock
companies formed in England during the 18th and early 19th centuries, before
incorporation became widely available in 1844. Those companies obtained their legal
personality from partnership and trust law, and created the rest of their corporate
structure—including limited liability—by means of contract. 50 Why, then, do we
today have, in every advanced economy, elaborate statutes providing numerous
detailed rules for the internal governance of corporations?

1.4.1 Mandatory laws versus default provisions
In addressing this question, it is important to distinguish between legal provisions
that are merely default rules, in the sense that they govern only if the parties do not
explicitly provide for something different, and laws that are mandatory, leaving parties
no option but to conform to them. 51
       A significant part of corporate law—more in some jurisdictions, less in
others—consists of default provisions. 52 To this extent, corporate law simply offers a
standard form contract that the parties can adopt, at their option, in whole or in part.
A familiar advantage of such a legally provided standard form is that it simplifies
contracting among the parties involved, requiring that they specify only those
elements of their relationship that deviate from the standard terms. Corporate law’s
provision of such standard terms as default is thereby seen in economic terms as a
‘public good’. Default provisions can serve this function best if they are
‘majoritarian’ in content—that is, if they reflect the terms that the majority of well-
informed parties would themselves most commonly choose. 53
        Defaults can, however, also serve other functions, such as encouraging the
revelation of information. For example, where one contracting party is likely to have
superior information relevant to the transaction than is the other (or as economists say,
that party has ‘private information’), then a default provision may impose a burden, or
‘penalty’, on the informed party, with the understanding that the default may be
waived by disclosure of the information. The purpose of such a rule is to encourage

Law, in 89 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW 1395–1774 (1989).
52
   They are ‘defaults’ in the sense that they apply (as with computer settings) ‘in default’ of the parties
stipulating something else.

parties to reveal their private information—so that they can avoid the default
outcome—and consequently induce explicit bargaining between the parties that will
lead to an outcome superior to that which would otherwise be expected. 54 Such a
‘penalty default’ may not be a majoritarian default.
        Default provisions can be supplied in a variety of ways, the choice of which
affects the ease and means of ‘contracting around’ them. 55 A common form of
corporate law default is a statutory provision that will govern unless the parties
explicitly provide an alternative. The common U.S. requirement that a merger can be
approved by a vote of 50% of all outstanding shares is an example. That rule can be
displaced by a charter provision that explicitly requires approval by, say, 60% of the
shareholders, or 70%, or some other number.
         Alternatively, corporate law itself sometimes specifies the rule that will
govern if the default provision is not chosen—an ‘either-or’ provision. An example is
offered by French corporate law, which allows companies’ charters to opt for a two-
tier board structure as an alternative to the default single-tier one. 56 In other words,
the law in this case gives the corporation a choice between two statutory provisions,
one of which is the default and the other of which is the ‘secondary’ provision, with
the latter applying only if the firm opts out of the default (or, equivalently, ‘opts in’ to
the secondary provision). The law may also impose special procedures for altering a
default rule. For example, the law may impose a rule that is highly protective of non-
controlling shareholders, and then permit deviation from that rule only with approval
by a supermajority of all shareholders, or with separate approval by a majority of the
non-controlling shareholders, thereby providing some assurance that the default rule
will be altered only if the chosen alternative is superior for all shareholders. 57
        An extension of the binary two-alternative-provisions approach just described
is to provide corporations with a choice among a ‘menu’ of more than two alternative
statutorily-specified rules. 58 Although to date this approach is rarely taken within any
given corporation statute, 59 it can in effect be seen in the increasing choice among
alternative corporate forms, as we discuss below.

Y ALE L AW J OURNAL 87 (1989).
55
   The ease with which parties can ‘contract around’ a default provision will affect the way it operates.
For example, if the costs of contracting around a provision are high, it may be less useful as an
information-forcing ‘penalty’ default (although this will depend on the size of the ‘penalty’), but still
capable of functioning adequately as a ‘majoritarian’ default (as a majority of parties would prefer it
anyway). For a nuanced discussion of these and other issues, see Ayres and Gertner, supra note 54, at

   An exception is the UK’s Companies Act 2006, which makes provision for multiple forms of model
articles of association to be made available for different types of company: id., § 19(2). Another is
Italy’s menu of three board systems: a default single-tier one with a separate body in charge of internal
controls (‘collegio sindacale’), a new single-tier system with no such separate body, and a two-tier
system. See Article 2380, Civil Code.




                                                       19
        There are also important rules of corporate law that are mandatory. 60 Large
German corporations, for example, have no alternative but to give half of their
supervisory board seats to representatives of their employees, and publicly-traded
U.S. corporations have no alternative but to provide regular detailed financial
disclosure in a closely prescribed format. 61 The principled rationale for mandatory
terms of these types is usually based on some form of ‘contracting failure’: that some
parties might otherwise be exploited because they are not well informed; that the
interests of third parties might be affected; or that collective action problems (such as
the notorious ‘prisoners’ dilemma’) might otherwise lead to contractual provisions
that are inefficient or unfair.62 Mandatory terms may also serve a useful standardizing
function, in circumstances (such as accounting rules) where the benefits of compliance
increase if everyone adheres to the same provision.
        Mandatory rules need not just serve a prescriptive function, however. When
used in conjunction with a choice of corporate forms, they can perform an enabling
function similar to that served by default rules. More particularly, mandatory rules
can facilitate freedom of contract by helping corporate actors to signal the terms they
offer and to bond themselves to those terms. The law accomplishes this by creating
corporate forms that are to some degree inflexible (i.e., are subject to mandatory
rules), but then permitting choice among different corporate forms. 63 There are two
principal variants to this approach.
        First, a given jurisdiction can provide for a menu of different standard form
legal entities from which parties may choose in structuring an organization. In some
U.S. jurisdictions, for example, a firm with the five basic attributes of the business
corporation can be formed, alternatively, under a general business corporation statute,
a close corporation statute, a limited liability company statute, a limited liability
partnership statute, or a business trust statute—with each statute providing a
somewhat different set of mandatory and default rules. Most conspicuously, the
number of mandatory rules decreases as one moves from the first to the last of these
statutory forms. The result is to enhance an entrepreneur’s ability to signal, via her
choice of form, the terms that the firm offers to other contracting parties, and to make
credible the entrepreneur’s commitment not to change those terms. Formation as a
business corporation, for example, signals simply and clearly—to all who deal with
the firm, whether by purchasing shares or simply by contract—that the firm is
characterized by a variety of familiar governance provisions, and that it will continue
to have those characteristics unless and until it changes statutory form. 64 Thus,
paradoxically, greater rigidity within any particular form may actually enhance
overall freedom of contract in structuring private enterprise, so long as there is a
sufficiently broad range of alternative forms to choose from.

64
   Third parties dealing with the firm can then ensure that no such change will occur by reserving a
contractual veto on it, e.g. in the form of an acceleration clause in a loan agreement.


                                                20
       Second, even with respect to a particular type of legal entity, such as the
publicly-traded business corporation, the organizers of a firm may be permitted to
choose among different jurisdictions’ laws. This leads us to the general issue of
‘regulatory competition’ in corporation law. Before addressing that topic, however,
we need to say more about the role of corporation law in general.

1.4.2 Legal rules versus contract
Default rules of corporate law do more than simply provide convenient standard
forms, encourage revelation of information, and facilitate choice of the most
efficient 65 among several alternative rules. They also provide a means of
accommodating, over time, developments that cannot easily be foreseen at the outset.
        A contract that, like a corporation’s charter, must govern complex
relationships over a long period of time, is—to use the word favored by economists—
necessarily incomplete. Situations will arise for which the contract fails to provide
clear guidance, either because the situation was not foreseeable at the time the
contract was drafted or because the situation, though foreseeable, seemed too unlikely
to justify the costs of making clear provision for it in the contract. Statutory
amendments, administrative rulings, and judicial decisions can provide for such
situations as they arise, either by adding new rules of corporation law or by
interpreting existing rules. This is the gap-filling role of corporation law.
        Courts can, of course, also fill gaps without making new law, simply by
interpreting privately-drafted contractual terms in a corporation’s charter. But a firm
will get the greatest advantage from the courts’ interpretive activity if the firm adopts
standard charter terms used by many other firms, since those standard terms are likely
to be subject to repeated interpretation by the courts. 66 And the most widely-used
standard charter terms are often the default rules embodied in the corporation law. So
another advantage of adopting default rules of law, rather than drafting specialized
charter terms, is to take advantage of the constant gap-filling activity stimulated by
the body of precedents developed as a result of other corporations that are also subject
to those rules. This is one example of a network effect that creates an incentive to
choose a common approach. 67
       The problem of contractual incompleteness goes beyond mere gap-filling,
however. Given the long lifespan of many corporations, it is likely that some of a
firm’s initial charter terms, no matter how carefully chosen, will become obsolete
with the passage of time owing to changes in the economic and legal environment.
Default rules of law have the feature that they are altered over time—by statutory
amendments and by judicial interpretation—to adapt them to such changing
circumstances. Consequently, by adopting a statutory default rule, a firm has a degree

65
   Here, as elsewhere, we use the term ‘efficient’, as conventionally used in the economics literature,
and as discussed below in Section 1.5, to refer to an organization of affairs that maximizes aggregate
social welfare.

C HICAGO L AW R EVIEW 1391, 1403–8 (1992).
67
   A related network effect that may encourage firms to adopt standardized charter terms, and in
particular to accept default rules of law, is that those provisions are more familiar to analysts and
investors, thus reducing their costs of evaluating the firm as an investment. Similar network effects
may cause legal services to be less expensive for firms that adopt default rules of law. See Marcel
Kahan and Michael Klausner, Standardization and Innovation In Corporate Contracting (or “The
Economics of Boilerplate”), 83 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW 713 (1997).


                                                     21
of assurance that the provision will not become anachronistic. If, in contrast, the firm
puts in its charter a specially-drafted provision in place of the statutory default, only
the firm itself can amend the provision when, over time, a change is called for. This
runs into the problem that the firm’s own mechanisms for charter amendment may be
vetoed or hijacked by particular constituencies in order, respectively, to protect or
further their partial interests. Simply adopting the statutory default rules, and
delegating to the state the responsibility for altering those rules over time as
circumstances change, avoids these latter problems. 68
        However, the quality and speed with which default rules are supplied,
interpreted and updated will depend on a range of institutional variables concerning
the legislative system, civil procedure, and judicial expertise. In the presence of
poorly designed rules of civil procedure, judicial resolution of disputes over the
interpretation of statutory provisions can also become a vehicle by which particular
constituencies can protect or further their partial interests. Conversely, the design of
the procedures for charter amendment will greatly influence the extent to which they
can be used for the furtherance of partial interests, as opposed to fostering efficient
change.
        For example, in the U.S., Delaware, the leading state of incorporation for
publicly-traded corporations, has a ‘rolling’ default regime under which changes in
default rules of law are applied to all corporations that do not have explicitly
inconsistent terms in their charters. One indication that these statutory default rules
successfully play a role of ‘delegated (re)contracting,’ is the striking rarity with which
U.S. publicly traded corporations deviate from their provisions. It is rare for a U.S.
publicly traded corporation to include, in its charter, a provision that is not clearly
specified as a default rule in the statutory law of the state in which the firm is
incorporated. 69 In contrast, in the UK, the ‘model’ articles of association provided by
the companies legislation apply on a ‘fixed’ basis, so that changes to the model
provisions do not automatically update the articles of association of companies
formed under the previous provisions. 70 Concomitantly, rates of ‘opt out’ from the
UK’s model provisions seem to be quite high. 71 However, alteration of the articles of
association for a UK company is a more straightforward procedure than for a
Delaware-incorporated firm. 72
        It follows from much of the foregoing that, for many corporations, there may
often be little practical difference between mandatory and default rules. Firms end up,
as a practical matter, adopting default rules as well as the mandatory rules. This
suggests that there may be more scope for introducing flexibility into firms’ choice of
structure through the provision of menus of alternative default rules. There is arguably
room for further development of this approach, with corporation statutes providing

69
   See Listokin, supra note 55. The position regarding close corporations is more varied. Many of these
have highly specialized charters—arguably reflecting the greater ease of efficiently renegotiating the
corporate structure among the small number of parties involved and the fact that structural changes are
likely to occur anyway as the firm (hopefully) evolves from a start-up to a listed company.

72
   In the UK, this is a decision purely for the shareholders, albeit requiring a supermajority vote (75%)
(§§ 21and 283 Companies Act 2006 (UK)), whereas in Delaware, a charter amendment must first be
proposed by the board, prior to a shareholder vote (§ 242(b) Delaware General Corporation Law).

richer menus of alternative default terms for various aspects of corporate governance,
all of which are (re)interpreted and amended over time to keep them current. At
present, however, the closest that the law comes to such a menu approach lies in the
abilities of participants to select from a range of different business forms—which we
have discussed—and of corporations to choose the jurisdiction by whose corporation
law they will be governed, which is the subject to which we turn next.

1.4.3 Regulatory competition
The various forms of flexibility in corporate law on which we have so far
concentrated—the choice of specially-drafted charter provisions versus default
provisions, the choice of one default rule in a given statute as opposed to another, and
the choice of one statutory form versus another—can all be provided within any given
jurisdiction. As we have noted, however, there can be yet another dimension of
choice—namely, choice of the jurisdiction in which to incorporate.
       In the United States, for example, the prevailing choice of law rule for
corporate law is the ‘place of incorporation’ rule, which permits a business
corporation to be incorporated under—and hence governed by—the law of any of the
50 individual states (or any foreign country), regardless of where the firm’s principal
place of business, or other assets and activities, are located. Where, as in the U.S.,
such choice is available at low cost, a given jurisdiction’s corporation statute simply
serves as an item on a menu of alternative standard forms available to the parties
involved. As in the case where there is intra-jurisdictional choice of alternative forms,
mandatory rules in any given jurisdiction’s corporation law may serve not to constrain
choice of form but actually to enhance it, by making it easier for firms to signal, and
to bond themselves to, their choice among alternative attributes.
        That form of choice, long available within the United States and in a number
of other countries as well, is now being extended to corporations throughout the
European Union as a consequence of recent decisions of the European Court of
Justice that have largely substituted the place of incorporation rule for the ‘real seat’
doctrine under which, in many European countries, firms were formerly required to
incorporate under the law of the state where the firm had its principal place of
business. 73
        The consequence of choice across jurisdictions is not just to enlarge the range
of governance rules from which a given firm can choose, but also to create the
opportunity and the incentive for a jurisdiction to induce firms to incorporate under its
law—and thereby bring revenue to the state directly (through franchise fees) and
indirectly (through increased demand for local services) by making the jurisdictions’
corporate law unusually attractive. Whether such ‘regulatory competition’ is good or
bad has been the subject of vigorous debate. Pessimists argue that it creates a ‘race to
the bottom’ in which the state that wins is that which goes furthest in stripping its law

of protections for constituencies who do not control the reincorporation decision.
Optimists argue that, on the contrary, regulatory competition in corporate law creates
a virtuous ‘race to the top’ in which—because the capital markets price, more or less
accurately, the effects of corporate law on shareholder welfare—the state that wins is
that whose law is most effective in protecting the rights of shareholders and other
corporate constituencies. 74 Clearly, the process by which reincorporation is effected
will also be an important factor in determining the nature of any such ‘race’ that is
conducted. 75 The more inclusive the process of parties involved in the firm, the less
likely it is that reincorporation will result in a ‘race to the bottom’.
        Moreover, the effectiveness of regulatory competition presumably depends on
the context in which it operates. In contrast to the European Union, for example, the
United States offers the advantage of homogeneous property and contract law across
its member states and largely federalized bankruptcy and tax law. 76 Even so, only one
among the fifty American states—Delaware—has made a sustained effort to attract
incorporation by out-of-state firms. 77 It has been quite successful in this effort, now
serving as the state of incorporation for roughly half of all U.S. publicly-traded
corporations, even though few of those corporations do any significant amount of
business in Delaware. As part of its effort to remain attractive as a place of
incorporation, Delaware’s legislature regularly updates its corporation statute,
generally deferring to a drafting committee dominated by practising lawyers. The
Delaware judiciary, in turn, has a particular court (the ‘chancery court’) that is largely
specialized to deal with corporate law cases, and is a constant source of judge-made
law that interprets and supplements the statutory law. This focused attention to law-

making clearly has important virtues, although not all agree that the result is an
optimal body of corporate law. 78
       Of course, there is dispute as to what constitutes an ‘optimal’ body of
corporate law, even in theory. That is our next topic.

1.5 WHAT IS THE GOAL OF CORPORATE LAW?
What is the goal of corporate law, as distinct from its immediate functions of
defining a form of enterprise and containing the conflicts among the participants in
this enterprise? As a normative matter, the overall objective of corporate law—as
of any branch of law—is presumably to serve the interests of society as a whole.
More particularly, the appropriate goal of corporate law is to advance the aggregate
welfare 79 of all who are affected by a firm’s activities, including the firm’s
shareholders, employees, suppliers, and customers, as well as third parties such as
local communities and beneficiaries of the natural environment. This is what
economists would characterize as the pursuit of overall social efficiency.
        It is sometimes said that the goals of corporate law should be narrower. In
particular, it is sometimes said that the appropriate role of corporate law is simply
to assure that the corporation serves the best interests of its shareholders or, more
specifically, to maximize financial returns to shareholders or, more specifically still,
to maximize the current market price of corporate shares. Such claims can be viewed
in two ways.
        First, these claims can be taken at face value, in which case they neither
describe corporate law as we observe it nor offer a normatively appealing aspiration
for that body of law. There would be little to recommend a body of law that, for
example, permits corporate shareholders to enrich themselves through transactions
that make creditors or employees worse off by $2 for every $1 that the shareholders
gain.
        Second, such claims can be understood as saying, more modestly, that focusing
principally on the maximization of shareholder returns is, in general, the best means
by which corporate law can serve the broader goal of advancing overall social
welfare. In general, creditors, workers, and customers will consent to deal with a
corporation only if they expect themselves to be better off as a result. Consequently,
the corporation—and, in particular, its shareholders, as the firm’s residual claimants 80
and risk-bearers—have a direct pecuniary interest in making sure that corporate
transactions are beneficial, not just to the shareholders, but to all parties who deal with
the firm. We believe that this second view is—and surely ought to be—the appropriate

   When we speak here of advancing or maximizing the ‘aggregate welfare’ of society we are using a
metaphor that is conceptually a bit loose. There is no coherent way to put a number on society’s
aggregate welfare, much less to maximize that number—and particularly so when many benefits are in
appreciable part non-pecuniary. What we are suggesting here might be put more precisely in the
language of welfare economics as pursuing Kaldor-Hicks efficiency within acceptable patterns of
distribution.
80
   Shareholders are a corporation’s ‘residual claimants’ in the sense that they are entitled to appropriate
all (and only) the net assets and earnings of the corporation after all contractual claimants—such as
employees, suppliers, and customers—have been paid in full.

interpretation of statements by legal scholars and economists asserting that
shareholder value is the proper object of corporate law.
        Whether, in fact, the pursuit of shareholder value is generally an effective
means of advancing overall social welfare is an empirical question on which
reasonable minds can differ. While each of the authors of this book has individual
views on this claim, we do not take a strong position on it in the Chapters that follow.
Rather, we undertake the broader task of offering an analytic framework within which
this question can be explored and debated.

1.6 WHAT FORCES SHAPE CORPORATE LAW?
To say that the pursuit of aggregate social welfare is the appropriate goal of corporate
law is not to say, of course, that the law always serves that goal. Legislatures and
courts are sometimes less attentive to overall social welfare than to the particular
interests of influential constituencies, such as controlling shareholders, corporate
managers, or organized workers. Moreover, corporate law everywhere continues to
bear the imprint of the historical path through which it has evolved, and reflects as
well the influence of a variety of non-efficiency-oriented intellectual and ideological
currents. 81
        We touch here briefly on several of the most conspicuous of these various
forces that help shape corporate law.

1.6.1 Patterns of corporate ownership
The nature and number of corporate shareholders differ markedly even among the
most developed market economies, and surely leave a mark on the structure of
corporate law.
         In the U.S. and the UK, there are large numbers of publicly-traded
corporations that have dispersed share ownership, such that no single shareholder, or
affiliated group of shareholders, is capable of exercising control over the firm. 82
Shareholdings among major Japanese firms are also often very dispersed, 83 though in
the second half of the 20th century it was common for a substantial fraction of a
firm’s stock to be held by other firms in a loose group with substantial reciprocal
cross-shareholdings. 84 In the nations of continental Europe, in contrast, even firms
with publicly-trading shares have traditionally had a controlling shareholder, in the

form of an individual or family (as in Italy), another firm, or a closely coordinated
group of other firms (as in Germany), 85 or the state (as in France).
         The types of entities by or through which shares are held also differ
substantially from one country to another. In the U.S., for example, while individuals
continue to hold a substantial amount of stock directly, the majority of stock is now
owned by two types of ‘institutional investors’ – mutual funds and employer-
established pension funds—though there are many thousands of both types of funds
and an individual fund rarely holds a significant fraction of a given company’s
stock. 86 In England, institutional investors (mainly pension funds and insurance
companies) also own a large fraction of corporate stock, 87 but—in contrast to the U.S.
pattern—the thirty or so largest funds together hold a sufficiently large share of the
stock in many companies to exert substantial control.88 In Germany, large commercial
banks traditionally held substantial blocks of corporate stock on their own account,
and also served as custodians for large amounts of stock owned by individuals, whose
votes were often effectively exercised by the banks themselves. 89 Recent years have
seen the rise of new types of institutional investors as well. Conspicuous among these
are hedge funds—relatively unregulated collective investment funds that, despite their
name, 90 often adopt highly speculative strategies that involve substantial stakes in
individual firms, and that sometimes seek to exercise control over those firms—and
private equity firms, which are (typically) nonpublic firms that acquire, at least
temporarily, complete ownership of formerly public companies to effect major
changes in the firms’ structure, strategy, or management. 91
        Arguably, such differences in patterns of shareholding across countries are the
consequence, at least in part, of differences in the structure of corporate law. There is
now a large empirical ‘law and finance’ literature that seeks to demonstrate, in
particular, that countries with greater protection for non-controlling shareholders
against opportunism by managers and controlling shareholders have less concentrated
shareholdings as a consequence, 92 though subsequent studies have sometimes failed

85
   However, there are indications that the traditional position in some jurisdictions, notably Germany, is
starting to change in favour of more dispersed stock ownership: see Darius Wojcik, Change in the

to replicate these results, 93 and the conclusions to be drawn from them are much
debated. 94
         There can be little doubt, however, that the reverse is (also?) true: the structure
of corporate law in any given country is in important part a consequence of that
country’s particular pattern of corporate ownership, which is in turn determined at
least in part by forces exogenous to corporate law. 95 It has been argued, for example,
that the fragmented pattern of U.S. shareholdings is to a substantial degree a result of
that country’s tradition of populist politics, which has produced a number of policies
successfully designed to frustrate family and institutional control of industrial
enterprise. 96 Correspondingly, it is said that the traditionally more concentrated share
ownership patterns in continental Europe and Japan complemented particular patterns
of industrial development. 97 In particular, a controlling shareholder may be better
placed to make credible long-term commitments to employees, which in turn may
facilitate labor relations—and hence productivity—where the goal is to motivate
workers to use existing technology, rather than to develop new technologies. 98
        These patterns of share ownership, in turn, have helped shape corporate law in
two ways. The first, which we might term the ‘distributional’ effect of corporate
ownership on corporate law, is through the influence they give to particular interest
groups to shape corporate law in ways that distribute a larger fraction of the fruits of
enterprise to themselves. For example, the dispersed share ownership of U.S. publicly
traded corporations has given corporate managers substantial autonomy, which they
have used—via lobbying, litigation, and choice of their state of incorporation—to
help give U.S. corporation law a distinctly managerialist character. Second, in what
we might term in contrast the ‘efficiency effect,’ share ownership patterns shape the
problems to which reforms designed to facilitate investment respond. Thus the
dispersed pattern of U.S. shareholdings has brought changes in corporate law, 99 such

as investor-oriented disclosure rules, designed to reassure investors and hence make it
less costly for firms to raise capital within that pattern of ownership. 100
        Both the distributional effect and the efficiency effect of corporate ownership
on corporate law are likewise evident in other countries. Corporate law everywhere
clearly reflects the institutional and political power of a country’s dominant corporate
interests, whether they be banks, prominent families, investment funds, or unions. At
the same time, all of the wealthy countries whose law we focus on have, to a greater
or lesser degree, self-consciously shaped their law to enhance the efficiency with
which corporations can be financed and managed in the context of the country’s
particular pattern of ownership. 101
        The distributional effects of ownership patterns often work against efficiency.
But that is not necessarily the case. Sometimes the interests of a dominant interest
group are aligned with broader social welfare. We turn next to some factors that affect
the tradeoff between distributional effects and efficiency effects.

1.6.2 International competition
Dominant ownership groups in a society are likely to be reasonably satisfied with the
current corporate law regime if it gives them access to capital on terms more
favorable than their competitors. In economies relatively closed to outside
competition, the principal competitors of an established firm will be newer and
smaller domestic firms. The owners of the established firms therefore have no interest
in legal reforms that make it easier for such competitors to obtain capital financing,
particularly from public capital markets—something the law might do, for example,
by making corporate managers and controlling shareholders more accountable to non-
controlling shareholders. 102 Meanwhile, the established firms can themselves rely on
other forms of capital financing, such as retained earnings and privileged access to
bank loans. 103
         These incentives change, however, in periods such as the present when world
tariff levels are low and the most important competitors of a country’s dominant
domestic firms are no longer other, smaller domestic firms but rather large foreign
firms. In such circumstances, it has been argued, 104 established domestic firms are
more concerned with raising more capital for themselves, to keep up with their
foreign competitors, than they are in denying capital to smaller domestic firms.
Consequently, the dominant ownership groups—for example, established industrial
families—become more amenable to investor-friendly reforms in corporate law.
Hence, the current fervor for corporate governance reform is perhaps in part a

deter market entry, as it is costly to acquire a reputation: see Simon Johnson, John McMillan and

consequence of the great success, in recent decades, in reducing barriers to
international trade.

1.6.3 Cross-jurisdictional coordination
Self-conscious supranational efforts to coordinate the regulation of corporations
across jurisdictions are another important source of both distributional and efficiency
pressures on corporate law. To some extent this coordination is being undertaken on a
global level—for example, in international efforts to develop common accounting
standards. 105 It is currently most conspicuous, however, in the European Union’s
efforts to further the integration of its common market. Loosely speaking, those
efforts take two different—and largely conflicting—forms: harmonization and
regulatory competition.
        Harmonization was the initial route pursued towards integration of corporate
law. These efforts, generally in the form of EC legislation, sought to impose uniform,
or at least minimum, rules of corporate law upon all member states. Successful
harmonization changes the arena for the exercise of interest group influence from the
individual member states to the EC. As such, it encountered a great deal of domestic
interest group opposition. The effect so far has largely been deadlock: many of the EC
directives that have been adopted, and that are mandatory for the member states, deal
with relatively unimportant matters. 106 Whether that is a bad thing is subject to
debate. At least some of the directives adopted to date—such as uniform minimum
legal capital requirements—might be seen as favoring distributional pressures more
than pressures for efficiency, raising the concern that truly comprehensive
harmonization might lock in forms of regulation that are seriously inefficient.
        More recently, among the EU states a certain degree of regulatory competition
—which, in contrast to harmonization, is a ‘bottom-up’ rather than a ‘top-down’
process of legal change—has been unleashed by decisions of the European Court of
Justice. As we noted earlier, the Court has struck down various efforts by individual
states to impose their rules of corporation law on firms operating locally but
incorporated in other member states. 107 As a mechanism for market integration, this
bypasses the domestic interest groups that have held up legislative harmonization.
However, it too may be susceptible to distributional pressures if the person(s)
choosing a company’s state of incorporation stand to benefit from this decision at the
expense of other constituencies. The future path of European company law will be
determined in large part by the relative scope that harmonization and regulatory
competition are given in the years to come.
        A similar though more attenuated tug-of-war between the creation of uniform
rules of law at the supra-jurisdictional level and the creation of a uniform market for
corporate law across jurisdictions via regulatory competition has long been playing
out as well among the federated states of the United States. The result has been an
uneasy and fluid allocation of corporate law between the federal government on the
one hand and the individual states (led by Delaware) on the other. A widely-noted
step in this process was taken with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2003 which—in the

aspects of corporate governance previously left to the states.
        This is principally a book about the structure and functions of corporate law,
not about its origins. Nonetheless, in the chapters that follow we will here and there
explore, briefly and a bit speculatively, the influence of the forces just surveyed—and
of others as well—in shaping the patterns of corporate law that we see across
jurisdictions.
