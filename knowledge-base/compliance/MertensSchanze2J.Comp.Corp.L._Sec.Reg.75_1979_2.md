THE GERMAN CODETERMINATION ACT OF 1976


HANS-JOACHIM MERTENS * and ERICH SCHANZE **



   On July 1, 1978 about 650 enterprises in the Federal Republic of Germany
made the transition to the requirements of Mitbestimmung under the Codetermina-
tion Act of 1976 (Mitbestinmzungsgesetz 1976, hereinafter called "the Act") [1].
These enterprises represent the bulk of Germany's largest firms in all sectors of the
economy. The 1976 Act extended labor's vote to a "formal" fifty:fifty parity [21
on the supervisory councils of enterprises with 2,000 or more employees organized
in the various forms of corporate organization available under the German corpora-
tion law [3]. These forms are mainly the public corporation (Aktiengesellschaft =
AG), the partnership limited by shares (Kommanditgesellschaft auf Aktien =
KGaA), and the limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschrdnkterHaftung =
GmbH).


1. Background of the Act

    For an observer who is not familiar with the tradition of German industrial rela-
tions, the enactment of the 1976 law is likely to be perplexing. He might be sur-
prised to learn that the Act was ultimately adopted by an overwhelming majority
of the legislature: only twenty-two members of the Bundestag (five per cent of the
total) voted against the Act; one member abstained [4]. On the other hand the Act
was not received with enthusiasm by workers and unions, since it was regarded as
a compromise by all sides.
    Labor, particularly as represented by the powerful German Trade Union, which
is the head union of the principal branch unions, has always insisted on a "full"
fifty:fifty parity, according to the codetermination model which has been appli-

 cable since 1951 for the coal and steel industry (Montanindustrie) [5]. The Act
 does not provide such parity. It is a compromise in the following respects: (i) a
 special group of managerial employees is given a vote within the labor block on the
supervisory council, and (ii) the chairman, who as a rule would come from the
shareholders' side, is given the deciding vote in the event of a deadlock on the coun-
 cil. These items will be treated in more detail following an outline of the framework
 of industrial relations and corporate organization that has emerged in Germany
 since the beginning of this century.
     The concept of Mitbestimmung, as embodied in the Act, is part of an alternative
strategy for increasing labor's influence in industrial relations [6]. Although there is
a long and substantial tradition of free collective bargaining in Germany, the
German union movement has insisted from the beginning of the century (and par-
ticularly during the nineteen-twenties) on specific forms of institutionalized partic-
ipation in the decision-making processes of enterprises. The unions repeatedly
appealed to the legislature to install participatory institutions at the various levels
of control in industry and business. The first efforts pertained mainly to the plant
level. In 1920, the Works Councils Act [7] provided for participation by labor
representatives with respect to a defined set of issues having primarily a personnel/
social significance [8]. This participatory body was abolished in the Hitler era and
replaced by a plant organization according to the "Fiihrer"principle. In postwar
Germany the institution of works councils was reinstated by Statute 22 of the
Allied Control Commission and subsequent legislation in the various federal states
 [9]. The Works Constitution Act of 1952 [10] introduced this scheme on the
federal level.
     The emergence of codetermination on the enterprise level through worker repre-
sentation on the board stems from two decisive factors, one relating to corporate
law, the other to political aspects of German trade unionism. The legal factor is the
so-called "two-tier" system of management under German corporation law, which
provides for a supervisory council, overseeing an executive board, as the representa-
tive organ of the shareholders. The political factor is unionism's specific ideological
bent, a peculiarity of the German trade union movement.
     German unions have been traditionally much less pragmatic than their British or
American counterparts, and thus the local (plant) level has been less important
 [11]. The emphasis on ideology in trade unionism is a consequence of a high degree
of organization on the national level. In the nineteen-twenties the ideological orien-
tation of the principal national organization was socialist; it adopted a strategy of
social reform, dropping plans for expropriation and turning towards an "integrative"
approach. At this time F. Naphtali, one of the ideological heads of the union move-
ment, formulated the concept of "industrial democracy". He proposed the shared
commitment of capital and labor through institutional representation of labor [12].
These postwar objectives, which were still abstract in their formulation, never mate-
rialized, since the union movement was abolished in the Hitler era.
    After the Second World War the British military administration, backed by the
           H.-J.Mertens, E. Schanze / The German CodetermzinationAct of 1976

Attlee government, encouraged the re-established unions to realize their partici-
patory plans for equal board representation in the coal and steel industry. The sub-
sequent Codetermination Act of 1951 for this industry (the Montanindustrie) [13
was adopted by the conservative legislature of the newly established Federal Re-
public of Germany after threats of collective action were made by the unions. In
this context it should be mentioned that throughout Europe the basic industries are
frequently not organized in strictly free enterprise form, but involve a high degree
of public control through their administrative organs [14]. Thus, the German
model of Montanmitbestimnung was regarded by many as a general exception from
normal governance arrangements. As for the other branches of economy in the
Works Consitution Act of 1952 [15] the Adenauer government introduced the legal
requirement c.f a formal participation by workers on the supervisory councils of all
enterprises organized in the corporate form with more than 500 employees [16].
The legislation provided for workers' representatives to hold one-third of the seats
in each council.


2. The debate about a higher degree of codetermination

    The German experience with the various forms of codetermination established
by the coal and steel legislation and the Works Constitution Act was fairly satis-
factory. Empirical studies by prominent scholars stressed the integrative benefits
of the codetermination pattern [17]. The stability and the smooth functioning of
German industrial relations were attributed to the integrative institutionalized
approach of both labor and management. On the other hand there were signs of
increasing bureaucratization and inflexibility with respect to managerial decisions.
Although the total amount of upstream information relevant to managerial deci-
sions is likely to be increased by additional labor representation on the managerial
organs of the corporation, the decision-making procedures tend to be slowed down
and to lose their clear entrepreneurial orientation. Moreover, it seems obvious that
one of the key functions of corporate organization, the raising of working capital,
is impaired by reducing the shareholders' right to determine the corporate future
fully. Some commentators warned that the existing system of collective bargaining
would be impaired through a mode of codetermination in which labor would be
acting as its own counterpart in the struggle for wages and labor conditions [18].
Also, a number of commentators argued that the present scheme of equal represen-
tation on the supervisory council would be an uncompensated expropriation of
shareholder rights [19]. These arguments against the constitutionality of the Act
have recently been foreclosed by the decision of March 1, 1979 of the Constitu-
tional Court [20]. In one of the most important decisions in the Court's history
relating to economic regulation the Constitutional Judges declared the Act to be
consonant with a number of clauses of the Federal Constitution. They stated that
the shift of controlling powers in the corporation were within the limits of parlia-
78          H.-T Mertens, E. Schanze / The German CodeterminationAct of 1976

mentary discretion. Counsel for the complaining parties had argued that the Act
would have disastrous consequences. In rejecting this argument the Court pointed
out that the evaluation of the consequences of the Act is so complex that the legis-
lature should have a right to be wrong in its prognosis as long as it has followed
proper modes of evaluation. The justification for reducing the property position
of the individual shareholder through codetermination rights of labor is based on
the premise that a capital share of a corporation represents a less intensive kind of
ownership than the title to personal tangible property "as an element of the guaran-
tee for personal freedom of the individual" [21].


3. The Act of 1976: no full parity

    A close look at the Act shows that a genuine parity between capital and labor
 has not been reached.
    The functions of the supervisory council [22] are limited. The central functions
 of the council consist of appointing and removing the executive board [23] and
 continuously supervising the board's actions [24]. However, the council may not
 interfere with the active management of corporate affairs [25]. The executive
board must report to the supervisory council on the affairs of the corporation [26].
The council as a whole and its individual members (the latter only by special delega-
tion) are entitled to examine the corporate books and records [27]. The charter
may provide for council approval of specific types of transactions [28]. In addition,
the law allows the council itself to require that specific types of transactions be sub-
 mitted for its approval [29], although in practical effect this right is limited as a
matter of the council's factual competence and capacity.
    Although the Act provides for a formal fifty:fifty parity in the council [30], the
group of employee representatives is in fact split into three factions: workers' repre-
sentatives, union representatives, and managerial employees' representatives [31].
The difference between the workers' and the union representatives is that the latter
need not be company employees. While workers' candidates must have been com-
pany employees for a minimum of one year [32], union candidates are eligible if
they are officials of trade unions that are "represented within the company" [33],
i.e. they need only be active within the concern as representatives of union mem-
bers.
    The third group, managerial employees, was introduced into the legislation
mainly by the Liberal Party. The underlying concept was spelled out in Thesis I of
the Freiburg Theses of 1971 referring to codetermination [34]. The distinction
between these employees and those more usually designated as "workers" takes
account of the notion that in the modern corporation, in addition to the traditional
factors of capital (shareholders) and labor (workers), the disposition factor (mana-
gerial personnel) plays an increasingly important role. The Liberal Party argued that
this tlird factor required separate representation on the supervisory council within
           H.-J. Mertens, E. Schanze / The German Codetermnifation Act of 1976

the employee group. However, it is frequently assumed that the representative of
the managerial personnel, although a member of the employee side, will identify
his interest with that of the shareholders and will thus break up the format of equal
representation of capital and labor. Furthermore, the identification of "managerial
employees" under the Act posed serious problems prior to the holding of elections,
since this group was not defined by the Act [35]. Although this quandary produced
numerous comments in the legal literature, elections were carried out on the basis
of a decision of March 5, 1974 by the Federal Labor Court (BAG) [361. The court
listed a number of criteria to aid in identifying the managerial employee: the em-
ployee must, in part, exercise the duties of the entrepreneur; he must have substan-
tially free managerial discretion; he must hold a key position; and there must be at
 least a hypothetical polarity of interests between the managerial employee and the
 employees who carry out his directives [37].
    Probably the strongest inroad into the parity concept was the adoption of the
double vote of the chairman of the supervisory council in case of a deadlock. Sec-
tion 29 of the Act provides that decisions of the supervisory council require a sim-
 ple majority of all votes cast. If a vote ends in a tie, and if the stalemate continues
after a second vote, the chairman then has the decisive vote. The chairman is
elected by a special procedure 138], which normally leads to the result that, if all
of the shareholder representatives vote in his favor, these votes are sufficient for his
election. Thus, the procedure for resolving a deadlock favors shareholder interests.
The introduction of this procedure was one of the most disputed points at a late
stage in the deliberations on the bill. The Social Democrats, along with the trade
unions, preferred the Eleventh Man Procedure practiced in the coal and steel code-
termination model of 1951 [39]. Therein, the supervisory council is composed of
an equal number of labor and capital representatives, with a "neutral" member
co-opted. However, strong criticism was voiced by politicians and constitutional
lawyers alike against the introduction of such a procedure. They argued that leaving
the "tie-breaking" vote with the shareholders' side of board membership would
reduce the threat of the Act's being held unconstitutional on the grounds of un-
compensated expropriation of shareholder property or a violation of the principle
of free collective bargaining [40]. In response to this the coalition introduced the
present solution which secured a broad consent of all political parties [41].


4. Expansion of the supervisory council and complicated voting procedures

    The representation of the various groups in the supervisory council has led to a
massive inflation of the number of seats in the councils. Section 7 of the Act pro-
vides that an enterprise employing less than 5,000 employees will have a council of
six shareholders plus six labor members; up to 20,000 employees the number is
raised to eight plus eight; and above 20,000 employees a ten plus ten scheme is
required. The increased size of the board alone will inevitably lead to a higher
80          H.-J Mertens, E. Schanze / The German CodeterminationAct of 1976

 degree of formalization of the various flows of information that are indispensable
 for proper decision-making by all members of the board. We will come back to the
 question whether the codetermined council will assume the same powers held by
 the traditional shareholder-determined institution.
    Another feature that interferes somewhat with the general policy of the Act is
 the complication of the voting procedures. The various groups on the supervisory
 council are determined by different procedures. These procedures may even differ
 from enterprise to enterprise for the same group. It was necessary to promulgate
 three extensive election regulations [42], each more than one hundred sections
 long. The first regulation applies to the case of a single enterprise with one work
 unit, the second to enterprises with more than one work unit, and the third to
enterprises that are the parents or dominant shareholders of another codetermined
enterprise.
    As a rule in companies with less than 8,000 employees, representatives are
elected directly, while in enterprises with more than 8,000 employees the vote is
cast by electors. However, the schemes may be reversed by special vote of the em-
ployees. Thus, for example, similarly structured large enterprises such as the BASF
AG and the Farbwerke Hoechst AG employed different voting procedures for their
first election.
    On the shareholders' side the voting procedure, as in the past, is carried out in
the general meeting. The majority may elect all its own supervisory council mem-
bers. Hence, the argument that an employee or a group of employees already repre-
sented on the council could break the parity through buying shares is unrealistic;
their influence could be extended only in the unlikely circumstance that they had
acquired a statutory majority of shares. This problem is particularly relevant to the
ongoing discussion of the future of employee stock option plans which are now
operating in a number of codetermined enterprises and will eventually play an
increasingly significant role [43].


5. The codetermined corporation versus the shareholder-determined corporation: a
   new version of "Our Two Corporation Systems"?

    In his seminal article, "Our Two Corporation Systems", H.G. Manne has pre-
sented an analysis of the different worlds of the large and the small, closely-held cor-
poration [44]. He draws economic distinctions among three markets that have
influenced the legal structures of the large corporation [45]: the market for invest-
ment capital, the market for existing securities, and the market for corporate con-
trol. In this scheme, codetermination could be classified as a mode of legal interven-
tion in the market for corporate control. Before we turn to the question of how the
codetermination system will affect flows of control, which are traditionally exer-
cised through the shareholders' decision to buy or sell shares on the market, some
additional features of the Codetermination Act must be considered [46].
           H.-J. Mertens, E. Schanze / The German CodeterninationAct of 1976

    The Act does not cover all enterprises that have reached a specific size. Besides
the exemption for so-called "enterprises working for a specific tendency" (Ten-
denzbetrieb) [471 the Act does not apply to enterprises that are not organized
according to the specific forms of organization provided by the law. While most
large corporations are organized as one of the three main forms (AG, KGaA, and
GmbH), a number of avenues of escape remain open to other enterprises cast in
other forms of legal organization [48]. German corporation law rests on the prin-
ciple of freedom of choice from among a number of different legal forms of organi-
zation. If specific forms or specific size characteristics are present, the firm remains
outside the reach of codetermination. For instance, commercial partnerships (OHG),
genuine limited partnerships (KG), the so-called "wirtschaftliche Verein" (club with
economic objectives), and the mutual insurance company are not covered by the
Act. Foreign corporations are per se not affected since one of the objectives of the
Act is non-interference with foreign corporation law [49]. The size criterion of
2,000 employees may be circumvented by a split into two or more "local" corpora-
tions, although all employees of affiliates of a group (Konzern) [50] are construed
as belonging to the parent corporation [51 ]. Thus, only affiliates on the same level
that are controlled by a firm not bound to codetermination are outside the reach
of the Act [521. Since, according to German law, legal persons (e.g., a GmbH) may
be partners of a commercial partnership, it is possible for a "double corporation" to
construct such a partnership and thus avoid application of the Act [53].
   The codetermination pattern described above refers essentially to the "normal"
case of the stock corporation (AG). The Act does not have identical effects on the
other forms of incorporated enterprises to which it applies [54].
A. The limited liability company (GmbH)
    In the case of the GmbH the supervisory council (which is not a statutory but an
optional organ of this legal form) has less controlling power than in the stock cor-
poration. The rights of the council sometimes conflict with the rights of the general
meeting. The supervisory council, for example, may review the annual statement
but is not given the power of final approval; that decision remains within the power
of the general meeting [55]. Furthermore the GmbH law and the Codetermination
Act are not synchronized in another respect: the director of the GmbH is appointed
and removed by the supervisory council, and must accept its directives with respect
to transactions defined by the charter; however, the general meeting is also entitled
to give binding directives [56]. Also, in the common case of a majority shareholder-
director, the charter may provide for a lifetime appointment, which necessarily con-
flicts with the statutory right of the supervisory council to remove the director
[57].
B. Partnershiplimited by shares (KGaA)
   In the case of the KGaA [58] (a limited partnership where the limited partner is
a group of shareholders) a conflict may arise between the general partner, who is
 82         H.-J Mertens, E. Schanze / The German CodetermilationAct of 1976

fully responsible for the corporate debts, and the vote of the codetermined super-
visory council. The powers of the KGaA council are again less broad than those of
the council of the stock corporation; the Act does not remove these limits even in
the case of a codetermined council. The council does not have the right to appoint
and to remove the general partner-director; thus, in controversial situations he can-
not be threatened with removal when his term expires. The charter may also pro-
vide for binding directives by the general meeting which eventually may conflict
with the ability of the codetermined supervisory council to intervene in a particular
transaction.

C. Amendment of the charter

    The amendment of the charter and the bylaws [59] has been frequently regarded
 as an important device to place limits on codetermination [60]. A 1977 study [61]
 of fifty-eight proposals by stock corporations for charter amendments indicates
that a large number of corporations have recently amended their charters. In most
 cases amendments have involved a clearer definition of the competences of the vari-
 ous organs [62]. They have also included the possibility of appointing emergency
members to the council, so that the outcome of a vote will not be determined by
the absence of a member from one side [63]; the possibility of the chairman's
adjourning the meeting [64]; the requirement of a quorum [65]; the possibility of
employing absentee voting [66]; the creation of committees for the performance of
specific tasks which are normally vested in the council [67]; and a substantial num-
ber of new definitions of the competence of the council with respect to specific
acts to be carried out by the management [68].
    By and large these alterations are not contrary to the substance of the Act.
Although the 1977 empirical study dealt only with the stock corporation, amend-
ments of the company statutes will likely play a more substantial part in the private
forms of corporate organization, such as the GmbH and KGaA.

D. A "fourth" market?

    The fact that the Act leaves all these avenues open to opt for softer forms of
codetermination indicates that Germany will not only have a "two corporation sys-
tem" as a matter of size but also a new "two corporation system" at the large enter-
prise level as a matter of codetermination. The avowed adversaries of codetermina-
tion may prefer to choose a form of legal organization that permits no codetermina-
tion (or limited codetermination), even though that form may expose investors to
greater personal risks. The newly established competing systems might eventually (as
soon as proper empirical data are available) lead to a "fourth" market (in addition
to Manne's three markets), i.e. a market in which different organizational forms of
large enterprises will compete. Such a market will provide for a more rational
choice between the codetermined and the non-codetermined enterprise than can
            H.-J. Mertens, E. Schanze / The German CodetenninationAct of 1976

presently be made. First, both will require capital and bid for it in the market place.
Secondly, they will need labor. As yet the transaction costs of the two systems of
enterprise organization have neither been evaluated nor adequately defined and
debate about choices between the two systems presently remains in the lofty
heights of general assumptions about organizational models of enterprise and labor
 [69].


6. Legitimizing the business corporation

     It is widely assumed that codetermination is synonymous with legitimizing the
 large enterprise as a political unit. The quest for industrial democracy has been evi-
 dent from the outset of the debate on Mitbestimuning in Germany. Whether insti-
 tutionalized codetermination will be able to meet the needs of enterprise organiza-
 tion in the post-industrial society remains an open question. It has been argued
 that, in the long run, the pattern of codetermination will create a higher degree of
 efficiency in the macroeconomic process [70]. The increase of participatory ener-
 gies within the enterprise, it is argued, will eventually lead to more highly qualified
 individual workers, with greater potential, i.e., qualities that are prerequisite to the
 proper allocation of scarce human and natural resources in a functioning compet-
itive process.
     Even if this be true, a problem with the institutional approach to worker partici-
 pation remains. Giving legitimacy to the single large enterprise through internal par-
ticipatory institutions will effect a transfer of power from the general body politic
to the firm, and will eventually add to the autonomous power of the managerial
level. The codetermined supervisory council as an institutionalized battlefield of
interests may tend to lose the few control mechanisms with which it was endowed
when it was created as an asssembly of shareholders' representatives. Hence, it is
not unlikely that the battle in the supervisory council between shareholders and
employees may be decided in favor, not of the interests of either group, but in
favor of the policies and interests of management. This outcome would introduce
managerial autonomy anew into the structure of the corporation.
    As for the small shareholder who is traditionally the subject of frustrated cor-
porate reforms, the codetermination format will probably mean no serious change
in position. The single share will increasingly become a kind of qualified loan to a
large risk-avoiding institution [71]. The involvement of labor in the decision-
making processes of large enterprises may even have the political effect of strength-
ening the existing de facto governmental guaranties against the risks of corporate
breakdowns.
    Aggregate minorities, if well organized, may gain power by trading in their rights
to nominate a council seat. This might eventually create a new version of the
market for corporate control. The codetermination pattern is likely to be of more
relevance to the organization of groups of enterprises under the common direction
84         H.-J.Mertens, E. Schanze / The German CodeterninationAct of 1976

of a parent. Here, shareholdership has long been transformed into a mode of exer-
cising control that is only indirectly affected by decisions of the market place. In
the international group, codetermination may result in a higher degree of local con-
trol. The large private shareholders will have to choose whether or not to invest in
codetermined enterprises. At the moment this remains a question only of business
philosophy; after ten years' time and experience with the codetermination model,
more rational choices may be made.

Qualitizierte Mitbestimmung und Verfassungsrecht (1972). A number of prominent legal
scholars expressed this opinion in a hearing before the parliamentary Committee for Labor and
Social Order on Dec. 19, 1974;cf; Raiser,op. cit. supra n. 1, intro. to annot. 43-46. A compre-
hensive statement of the arguments against the present form of codetermination is found in
Badura, Rittner and Rithers, Mitbestimmungsgesetz und Grundgesetz, Gemeinschaftsgutachten
(1977). This "Cologne brief" in favor of the plaintiffs on the Constitutional proceedings was in
most points successfully challenged by the "Frankfurt brief" by Kilbler, W. Schmidt and
Simitis, Zur Verfassungsnifssigkeit des Mitbestimmungsgesetzes (1978) which was introduced
by the defendants; see infra n. 20.

    [461 For an instructive analysis of details of the modes of codetermination which also
includes economic considerations, see Chmielewicz, Grossmann, Inhoffen and Lutter, Die Mit-
bestimmung in Aufsichtsrat und Vorstand - Darstellung, Vergleich und Kritik der rechtlichen
Regehtngen aus juristischer und betriebswirtschaftlichcrSicht, 37 Betriebswirtschaft 105
(1977).
    1471 The Act, supra n. 1, at § I(4). "Enterprises working for a specific tendency" (Tendenz-
betrieb) include ventures wlhich are primarily non-business oriented but pursue political, reli-
gious, educational, scientific, charitable, or artistic objectives, and thus require a specific per-
sonal commitment of the employees (e.g. union press).
    1481 For a discussion of the problem of freedom of corporate organization as it relates to
regulation through the codetermination laws, see Naendrup, Mitbestimmung und Orgaisations-
freiicit, 1977 Arbeit und Recht 225, 268.
    [491 However, in Wengler, Die Mitbestimmung und das V6lkerrecht (1975), a prominent
international lawyer has argued that the Act is not consistent with the Treaty of Friendship,
Commerce and Navigation of Oct. 29, 1954 between the United States of America and the
 Federal Republic of Germany, and thus effects a breach of international law.

questions raised by this, see Ballerstedt, Das Mitbestinmungsgesetz zwischen Gesellschafts-,

    171] It is not unlikely that there will be shifts in corporate financing. The present high
degree of bank loan financing in Germany may be the result of the fact that the major banks
have had an undisputed ruling role in the supervisory councils. If the argument of "easy" and
discrete bank loans is challenged in the codetermined councils there may be new hope for a
revival of increased financing through the stock market. New risk-averse forms of stock invest-
ment, such as index funds, could encourage this trend.
