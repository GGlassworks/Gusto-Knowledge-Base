MATERIALS REQUIRED

•    Non-compressible shims.
•    Fasteners. The applicable building code should be consulted, to ensure compliance with all state and local
     requirements. At a minimum, fastener type should be sufﬁcient to properly afﬁx the frame and penetrate rough
     framing by 1-1/2" or more.
•    High-quality compatible exterior grade sealant.
•    Seal tape for the weather-resistant barrier. *
•    Self-adhering ﬂashing, in a width required by code but no less than 4”. AAMA 711 compliant ﬂexible butyl tape
     ﬂashing or equivalent is recommended. *
•    Backer rod. *
•    Low-expansive, low-pressure foam or batt type insulation. *
* Use and placement of these materials may be required by code, plan, or good building practices.




TOOLS REQUIRED




INSPECT AND PREPARE THE PRODUCT FOR INSTALLATION

1.   Inspect the window product thoroughly before beginning installation.

     •    Conﬁrm the window matches the size needed for the opening; measuring ½” smaller than the rough opening
          dimensions in width and height.

     •    Conﬁrm the window’s features match the requirements of the project, order, and opening; e.g., Low-E, color,
          code, rating, operating direction, egress.

     •    Conﬁrm there is no damage to the product and that all necessary pieces are in place for a complete installation;
          e.g., locks, labels, weather stripping.

          Do not proceed with installation if there are any concerns about the condition or suitability of the product for
          installation or compliance with project, order, code, or opening requirements.

2.   Keep the jambs plumb and square with the head and sill on the window throughout installation. Keep sashes
     closed and locked throughout installation. Avoid “crown up” or “bow down” conditions at both sill and head. Avoid
     “bowed out” installations by conﬁrming equal jamb widths throughout installation, especially at meeting rails.
INSPECT AND PREPARE THE ROUGH OPENING

1.   Make sure the rough opening is in good condition and plumb, level, and square to within 1/8” nominal tolerance.
     Framing conditions at the rough opening must be sufﬁcient to support the window unit, framing header above,
     and permit appropriate integration of the window into the building’s water management system. Rough openings
     shall be ½” larger than window frame in width and height.
2.   If the building already has a weather-resistant barrier (WRB) installed, it is necessary to prepare an opening in the
     WRB to accept the window. Milgard recommends that the installer follow the WRB manufacturer’s
     recommendation to prepare the opening. The steps that follow are Milgard's general guidelines for preparing a
     WRB opening and, where used, the installer must conﬁrm these steps will not impact the WRB manufacturer’s
     warranty or otherwise inhibit drainage before proceeding.
     Use a modiﬁed “I-cut” at the WRB. See Figure B.
     •   Begin with a horizontal cut across the entire width of the head and sill of the rough opening.
     •   Next, in the middle of the opening, make a vertical cut from head to the sill.
     •   Fold the WRB into the opening and secure, trimming excess as necessary. See Figure C.
     •   Finally, cut two slits in the WRB at the head corners that angle 45° away from the center of the opening. Each
         cut should be long enough to ensure that the WRB will fold over the entirety of the later-applied head ﬂashing.
         Fold the WRB upward as shown and temporarily fasten with tape. See Figure D.




FLASH AND SHIM THE SILL

Many options exist to ﬂash a window opening. Method and material selection involve pre-installation consideration of
factors such as the required building performance and speciﬁc water management system used. At a minimum,
Milgard suggests installers use a pan at the sill combined with a complete interior air dam around the product.
Installers should consult with the architect, owner, or other responsible site personnel for instructions regarding
appropriate ﬂashing of a window opening before installing Milgard's products.
1.   Start by cutting ﬂexible self-adhering ﬂashing no less than 12” longer than the width of the
     opening.
     •   Center the cut ﬂashing piece and lay it across the rough opening, allowing equal
         overlaps up the jambs, but no less than 6” on each side. Position the ﬂashing so that
         when pressed down onto the exterior sheathing or WRB, the ﬂashing will extend
         beyond the window ﬁn by at least 2”.
     •   Remove backing from ﬂashing and apply across sill and up jambs. Do not round the
         corners. Flashing must be secured squarely into the jamb-sill corners to avoid the risk of
         puncturing the ﬂashing. Use a J-roller to remove bubbles or creases.
     •   Fold ﬂexible ﬂashing down onto the WRB and secure. Use a J-roller to remove bubbles or creases.
     •   Where necessary, and using the steps above, apply an additional length of
         ﬂexible ﬂashing across the sill and up the jambs to ensure that the width of
         the window frame in the rough opening rests on applied and secured
         ﬂashing material. A completed installation should reﬂect Figure E.
2.   Install with FULL support under the entire width of the window sill. Note: For
     windows with intermediate meeting rails (IMR), and all slider windows, additional
     shims are recommended under each IMR and meeting rail/stile to ensure a level
     sill and proper operation. Sill shims should remain after installation is complete.
     Apply additional shims as necessary to maintain a level sill throughout
     installation. If necessary, secure shims with tape to prevent movement during
     setting of the window. See Figure F.


APPLY SEALANT, SET, AND
SECURE THE WINDOW

1.   Milgard recommends corrosion-resistant fasteners be located 3” to 6” from each
     corner, and then every 8” to 12” on center. Do not distort the mounting ﬁn during
     this process. Inspect sealant at all frame joints. Apply sealant at mechanically
     fastened corners as well as the full length of the joints where mounting
     ﬁns/ﬂanges meet.
2.   Apply a continuous 3⁄8” bead of premium grade, compatible exterior sealant to
     the backside of the mounting ﬁns (interior facing) at the head and jambs of the
     window near the outside edge of the mounting ﬁn. See Figure G. Apply a 3⁄8”
     bead of premium grade, compatible exterior sealant on the backside of the sill
     mounting ﬁn (interior facing).
3.   Set window into center of opening at sill ﬁrst. Push up into place. Place a
     temporary fastener near each corner at the head of the window no closer than 3”
     to either corner. Measure the window to ensure it has remained level and square,
     and the frame is not bowed. Unlock and open operable sashes. Adjust as
     required to ensure smooth operation. Close and relock sash. Adjust and place
     additional shims, as necessary, to secure the unit and ensure proper operation.
     Place additional fasteners in the bottom corners. Conﬁrm again unit is level,
     plumb, and square.
4.   Keeping the sash closed and locked, secure the window with fasteners of a type
     appropriate for the frame and that penetrate the rough framing by a minimum
     of 1-1/2” or as required by code. See Figure I. Take care to install fasteners
     straight, not angled. See Figure J. No fasteners should be located closer than 3”
     to any corner. Do not distort the mounting ﬁn with the fasteners. Milgard
     recommends its vinyl products have fasteners applied securely into every other
     pre-punched slot on all sides of the window. Fastening in locations other than
     the mounting ﬁn may damage the unit. Do not fasten the window using
     staples.




INTEGRATE THE WINDOW

1.   Cut two pieces of self-adhered ﬂashing for the jambs that extend a minimum of
     1” above the head mounting ﬁn and a minimum of 1” below the sill ﬂashing
     previously installed in Figure E. Apply ﬂashing over jamb mounting ﬁns. Use a J-
     roller to remove bubbles or creases. See Figure K.
2.   Cut a piece of self-adhered ﬂashing for application at the head of the window. Flashing
     must extend a minimum of 1” beyond the jamb ﬂashing applied in Figure E. Apply ﬂashing
     over the head mounting ﬁn. Use a J-roller to remove bubbles or creases. See Figure L.

3.   Remove tape holding WRB ﬂap and fold WRB downward covering the head mounting ﬁn.
     Be sure the WRB does not afﬁx to the head ﬂashing or create a pocket at the head of the
     window. Seal the WRB to the head ﬂashing using WRB sealant tape to cover the entirety
     of the top cuts previously made. See Figure M.
NOTE: Ensure that the ﬂ ashing tape is installed ﬂ ush to the window main frame completely
covering the mounting ﬂ anges.


INSULATE THE OPENING

4.   From the interior, insulate between the window frame and rough opening with ﬁberglass
     insulation or a measured use of low pressure, low expansion foam. Only use foam after
     determining that it will not distort the window frame when fully expanded. Check operation
     of the window after insulating to ensure proper operation.
5.   A complete interior perimeter seal around the window product is essential to ensure proper
     functioning of the sill ﬂashing method. Apply a properly backed continuous bead of sealant
     around the entire interior perimeter of the window. See Figure N. The seal must connect the
     ﬂashing applied at the sill plate to the window unit for proper functioning of the sill pan.


CONSIDERATIONS AND CAUTIONS

Considerations and Cautions
•    Care should be taken to ensure proper integration of the window into the building’s water
     management system and with the selected cladding. A properly designed ¼” sealant joint
     between all sides of the window frame and exterior cladding may be advisable. Consult the
     responsible architect, owner, or builder, as well as the cladding manufacturer’s instructions.
•    It is the sole responsibility of the owner, architect, and/or builder to select correct products to
     be in compliance with applicable laws, site requirements and building codes and to ensure
     that installation is in compliance with applicable laws, site requirements and building codes.
Important Cautions
•    Use of solvents or acids may damage components of this product and will limit rights under
     the warranty.
•    Stage and store window products with caution. Do not store in the sun or lay ﬂat before or
     during installation.
•    Care must be taken to ensure material compatibility of the window unit and surrounding
     building conditions. Where necessary, steps should be taken to isolate the window from
     reactionary building elements.
Post Installation Reminders
•    With the exception of logo and NFRC labels, all Milgard applied labels should remain in place
     and not be removed after installation is complete (e.g., AAMA labels, warranty labels, warning
     labels).
•    Milgard recommends a yearly inspection of its products and the surrounding materials, inside
     and outside the home. Upkeep of sealant joints, hardware and weather stripping can ensure
     longevity and proper functioning of the window products.
