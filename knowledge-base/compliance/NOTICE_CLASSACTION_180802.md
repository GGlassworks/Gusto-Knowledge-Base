                                    MARICOPA COUNTY

TX 2017-000663                                                            07/18/2018



       LATER:

        First, as a technical matter, the Court doubts that Mr. Vangilder is properly a party in this
action. It is well established in Arizona law that the incidence of a transaction privilege tax falls
on the business conducting the taxed transaction, and that purchasers lack standing to recover it.
Karbal v. Arizona Dept. of Revenue, 215 Ariz. 114, 115-17 ¶ 11 (App. 2007). Mr. Vangilder is
apparently no more than a consumer of goods purchased in taxable transactions, who has not
himself paid TPT. It appears, however, that one or more of the other Plaintiffs have standing.
The Court therefore need not explore the limits of the suggestion in Kerr v. Waddell, 183 Ariz. 1,
8 (App. 1994), that, a state law challenge to the validity of a tax statute may, like a federal law
challenge, be heard without payment and exhaustion of administrative remedies (which would be
unnecessary here, since the issue is a pure question of law for which a factual record is of no
use).

         The Court does not need to reach the constitutional arguments. Nor need it address
election law. It assumes that the voters of the county understood what they were voting for. The
critical issue is instead whether what they voted for conforms to the enabling statute - A.R.S. §
42-6106.

        Article IV, Part 1, § 1(3) of the Arizona Constitution authorizes the legislature (and by
extension inferior legislative bodies empowered by the legislature) to ”order the submission to
the people at the polls of any measure, or item, section, or part of any measure, enacted by the
legislature.” A legislative body is without power to refer a measure that has not been enacted.
Respect the Promise in Opposition to R-14-02--Neighbors for a Better Glendale v. Hanna, 238
Ariz. 296, 299-300 ¶ 12 (App. 2015). The Court must therefore look to what the Authority or the
Board of Supervisors enacted for submission to the voters. That was the text approved in
Resolution 2017-01. Whatever the voters might have wanted to vote for, what they did vote for,
the only thing they possibly could vote for, was that.

        A.R.S. § 42-6106(B)(1) requires that the transportation excise tax be levied on and
collected from “each person engaging or continuing in the county in a business taxed under
chapter 5, article 1 of this title,” i.e., the business categories declared taxable by § 42-5010.

       Proposition 417’s express reach extends only to “every person engaging or continuing in
the business of selling tangible personal property at retail.”

         The Authority argues that, by adding the word “including,” they expanded its scope to
coincide with the statute. That attempt was insufficient. “[I]nasmuch as a taxing statute must be
strictly construed, we cannot extend its application to include something not specifically covered
Docket Code 005                               Form T000                                         Page 2
                               SUPERIOR COURT OF ARIZONA
                                   MARICOPA COUNTY

TX 2017-000663                                                         07/18/2018


by the language thereof.” Corporation Comm. v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc. of U.S., 73 Ariz.
171, 178 (1951). Plainly, the proposition does not specifically cover any category except retail
sales.

       “Things may be brought under a tax if they are of the same kind or nature as the ones
enumerated.” Wilderness World, Inc. v. Dept. of Revenue State of Arizona, 182 Ariz. 196, 199
(1995). But the remaining taxable categories of Section 5010 are not “of the same kind or
nature” as retail sales, the only enumerated category. Persons in those categories therefore do not
pay the tax, and thus the proposition failed to include “each person” engaging in a taxable
business, as required by the authorizing statute.

         The Authority, citing Sherman v. City of Tempe, 202 Ariz. 339, 342 (2002), argues that
this action had to be filed before the election, and so must be dismissed for untimeliness. But this
case, unlike Sherman, is a challenge not to the procedure used to put the proposition on the
ballot, but to the substantive validity of the proposition as law. “As a true reflection of
democratic principles, Arizona citizens are not precluded from legislating on any issue, even
though the legislation might conflict with the Arizona Constitution or state law. The
constitutionality of such a measure will only be tested after it becomes law.” Winkle v. City of
Tucson, 190 Ariz. 413, 415 (App. 1997) (emphasis in original; internal citation omitted). Only
when final legislation emerged from the vote could its legality be contested.

      ACCORDINGLY, Plaintiffs’ Motion for Issuance of Declaratory Judgment is granted.
Defendants Pinal County and Pinal Regional Transportation Authority’s Cross-Motion for
Summary Judgment is denied.
