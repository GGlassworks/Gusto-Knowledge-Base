Firstl would like to thank Anna Biller, who helped edit and research this book, and whose in-
valuable insights played a critical role in the shape and content of 17w 48 Laws. Without her,
none of this would have been
                                possible.
       I must also thank my dear friend Michiel Schwarz who was responsible for involving me in
the art school Fabrika in Italy and introducing me there to _]oost Elffers, my partner and producer
of The 48 Laws ofPower. It was in the scheming world of Fabrika that _]oost and I saw the timeless-
ness of Machiavelli and from our discussions in Venice,
                                                         Italy, this book was born.
    I would like to thank Henri Le Goubin, who supplied me with many Machiavellian anec~
dotes over the years, particularly conceming the numerous French characters who play such a

large role in this book.
       I would also iike to thank Les and Sumiko Biller, who lent me their library on Japanese his-

tory and helped me with the Japanese Tea Ceremony part of the book. Similarly, I must thank
my good friend Elizabeth Yang who advised me on Chinese history.
   A book like this depended greatly on the research material available andl am particularly

grateful to the UCLA Research Library; I spent many pleasant days wandering through its in-
comparable collections.
     My parents, Laurette and Stanley Green, deserve endless thanks for their patience and
support.
       And I must not forget to pay tribute to my cat, Boris, who kept me company throughout the
never—ending days of writing.
     Finally, to those people in my life who have so skillfully used the game of power to manipu~
late, torture, and cause me pain over the years, I bear you no grudges and I thank you for sup
plying me with inspiration for The 48 Laws 0fP0wer.

                                   NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER

Always make those above you feel comfortably superior In your desire to please or impress them, do not go
toofar in displaying your talent: or you might accomplish the oppasite~»—-inspire fear and insecurity. Make
your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights ofpower.


                                               LAW 2     page 8

                             NEVER PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN FRIENDS,
                                    LEARN HOW TO USE ENEMIES
Be wary :.3ffziends——~they will betray you more quickly, for they are easibr aroused to envy. 'I‘hey also become

spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more
to
   prove. In fact, you have more to fearfromfriends than fitrm enemies. Ifyou have no enemies, find a way to
make them.


                                               LAW 3    page 16

                                     CONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS

Keep people off-balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no
clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide themfar enough down the wrong path, envelop
them in enough smoke, and by the time thrgv realize your intentions, it will be too late.


                                              LAW 4     page 31

                                 ALVVAYS SAY LESS THAN NECESSARY
When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more rommon you appear, and tlw less
in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open—ended,
and sphinxlike. Powerfltl people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you
are to say
             somethingfoolish.

                                               LAW 5     /mge37
                SO MUCH DEPENDS ON REPUTATION-—-GUARD IT WITH YOUR LIFE

Reputation is the cornerstone of power. Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win," once it slips,
however, you are vulnerable, and will be attacked on all sides. Make your reputation unassailable. Always be
akrt to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, learn to destroy your enemies by

opening holes in their own reputations. Then stand aside and let public opinion hang them.

                                   COURT ATTENTION AT ALL COST

Everything is judged by its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing: Never let yourselfget lost in the
 crowd, then, orburied in oblivion. Stand out. He conspicuous, at all cost. Malzeyourselfa magnet of attention
 by appearing larger, more colorful more mysterious than the bland and timid masses.

                                                                                              CONTENTS        [1

           GET OTHERS TO DO THE WORK FOR YOU, BUT ALWAYS TAKE THE CREDIT
Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to further your own muse. Not only will such assis-
tance save you valuable time and
                                    energy, it will give you a godlike aura of ejficiertcy and speed. In the end
your hehpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you.


                                               LAW 8     page 62

                MAKE OTHER PEOPLE COME TO YOU—-USE BAIT IF NECESSARY
When you forte the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent
come to
        you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him with fabulous gains-then attack. You hold
the cards.                                                                -

                WIN THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS, NEVER THROUGH ARGUMENT

Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Iyrrhir victory: The resent»
ment and ill will you stir up is stronger and lasts longer than any momentary change
                                                                                        of opinion. It is much
more
     powerful get
               to    others to agree  with you through your  actions, without saying :1 word. Demonstrate, do
not
    explicate.

                        INFECTION: AVOID THE UNHAPPY AND UNLUCKY
You can die from someone else’: misery-——emotional states are as infectious as diseases. Km may feel you are

helping the drowning man but you are only precipitating your own disaster: The unfortunate sometimes draw
misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Associate with the happy and fortunate instead.

                                               LAW 1 1    page 82

                           LEARN TO KEEP PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON YOU
To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more

freedom you have. Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear.
 Never touch them enough so that they can do without you.


                                               LAVV 12 page 89

            USE SELECTIVE HONESTY AND GENEROSITY TO DISARM YOUR VICTIM

One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones. 0pen~hea7ted gestures of honesty and

gertemsity bring down the guard of even the most suspicions people. Once your selective honesty opens a hole in
their armor; you can deceive and manipulate them at will. A timely gzfl-ma ’}i‘q,v'an horse-——zoill serve the same

purpose.

                                               LAW I 3    page 95

               WHEN ASKING FOR HELP, APPEAL TO PEOPLE’S SELFAINTEREST,
                              NEVER TO THEIR MERCY OR GRATITUDE

Ifyou need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him ofyour past assistance and good deeds. He
will find a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that
will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion, He will respond enthusiastically when he sees some-
thing to be gainedfor himself.

                                   POSE AS A FRIEND, WORK AS A SPY

Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead.
Better still: Play the spy yourself In polite social encounters, learn to probe. Ask indirect questions to get people
to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion that is not an
                                                                                   opportunity finr artful spying.

                                      CRUSH YOUR ENEMY TOTALLY
All great leaders since Adoses have known that a feared enemy must be crushed completely.          (Sometimes they
have learned this the hard way.) If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventu-

ally break out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation: The enemy will recover,
and will seek revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit.

                         USE ABSENCE TO INCREASE RESPECT AND HONOR

Too much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you

appear If you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked
about, even more admired. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity.

   KEEP OTHERS IN SUSPENDED TERROR: CULTIVATE AN AIR OF UNPREDICTABILITY

Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other peoples actions. Your pre-

dictability gives them a sense of control. Turn the tables: Be deliberately unpredictable. Behavior that seems to
have no consistency or purpose will keep them off—balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain
your moves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize.

    DO NOT BUILD FORTRESSES TO PROTECT YOURSELF—ISOLATION IS DANGEROUS

The world is dangerous and memies are everywhere——et/eryone has to protect themselves. A fortres.s seems the

 safest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects you frorn—-—it cuts you offflom valuable in-
formation, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target. Better to circulate among people, find allies, mingle.
 You are shielded from your          by the crowd.

        KNOW WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH—DO NOT OFFEND THE WRONG PERSON

There are many different kinds ofpeople in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to

your strategies in the same way. Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the rest of their lives
seeking revenge. They are wolves in lambs’ clothing. Choose your victims and opponents carefully, then—
never   offend or deceive the wrong person.

                                     DO NOT COMMIT TO ANYONE

It is the fool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to any side or cause but yourseh‘. By maintaining

your independence, you become the master of(ufhers—~playingj7eo[1le against one another: making them pursue
you.

habit. Too much innovation is traumatic, and will lead to revolt. Ifyou are new to a position ofpower, or an

essary, make it feel like a gentle improvement on the past.

The feeling of having no power over people and events is generally un-
bearable to us«—-when we feel helpless we feel miserable. No one wants less
power; everyone wants more. In the world today, however, it is dangerous
to seem too power hungry, to be overt with your power moves. We have
to seem fair and decent. So we need to be subtle~—congenial yet cunning,
democratic yet devious.
     This game of constant duplicity most resembles the power dynamic
that existed in the scheming world of the old aristocratic court. Throughout

history, a court has always formed itself around the person in power—king,
queen, emperor, leader. The courtiers who filled this court were in an espe-
cially delicate position: They had to serve their masters, but if they seemed
to fawn,   if they curried favor too obviously, the other courtiers around
them would notice and would act against them. Attempts to win the mas-
ter’s favor, then, had to be subtle. And even skilled courtiers capable of
such subtlety still had to protect themselves from their fellow courtiers,
who at all moments were scheming to push them aside.
    Meanwhile the court was supposed to represent the height of civiliza-
tion and refinement. Violent or overt power moves were frowned upon;
couniers would work silently and secretly against any among them who
used force. This was the couxtier’s dilemma: While appearing the very
paragon of elegance, they had to outwit and thwart their own opponents in
the subtlest of ways. The successful comtier learned over time to make all
of his moves indirect; if he stabbed an opponent in the back, it was with a
velvet glove on his hand and the sweetest of smiles on his face. Instead of

using coercion or outright treachery, the perfect courtier got his way
through seduction, charm, deception, and subtle strategy, always planning
several moves ahead. Life in the court was a never-ending game that re-

quired constant vigilance and tactical thinking. It was civilized war.
    Today we face a peculiarly similar paradox to that of the courtier:
Everything must appear civilized, decent, democratic, and fair. But if we
play by those rules too strictly, if we take them too literally, we are crushed
by those around us who are not so foolish. As the great Renaissance diplo-
mat and courtier Niccolo Machiavelli wrote,       “Any man who tries to be
good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who
are not   good.” The court imagined itself the pinnacle of refinement, but un-

with power, the better friend, lover, husband, wife, and person you be
 come. By following the route of the perfect courtier (see Law 24) you learn

 to make others feel better about themselves, becoming a source of pleasure

 to them. They will grow dependent on your abilities and desirous of your

 presence. By mastering the 48 laws in this book, you spare others the pain
 that comes from bungling with power—~by playing with fire without know-
 ing its properties. If the game of power is inescapable, better to be an artist
 than 2. denier or a bungler.


Learning the game of power requires a certain way of looking at the world,
a shifting of perspective. It takes effort and years of practice, for much of

the game may not come naturally. Certain basic skills are required, and
once
       you master these skills you will be able to apply the laws of power
more easily.




                                                                                     l
      The most important of these skills, and power’s crucial foundation, is
the ability to master your emotions. An emotional response to a. situation is
the single greatest barrier to power, a mistake that will cost you a lot more
than any temporary satisfaction you might gain by expressing your feel-
ings. Emotions cloud reason, and if you cannot see the situation clearly,
you cannot prepare for and respond to it with any degree of control.
      Anger is the most destructive of emotional responses, for it clouds
 your vision the most. It also has a ripple effect that invariably makes situa-
 tions less controllable and heightens your enemy’s resolve. If you are try»
 ing to destroy an enemy who has hurt you, far better to keep him off—guard
 by feigning friendliness than showing your anger.

                                                                                                Pl-RE FACE              rile

                                              Power requires the ability to play with appearances. To this end you
                                         must learn to wear many masks and keep a bag full of deceptive tricks. De-

                                         ception and masquerade should not be seen as ugly or immoral. All human
                                         interaction requires deception on many levels, and in some ways what sep—
                                         arates humans from animals is our ability to lie and deceive. In Greek

                                         myths, in India’s Mahabharata cycle, in the Middle Eastern epic of Gilga~
                                         mesh, it is the privilege of the gods to use deceptive arts; a great man,
                                         Odysseus for instance, was judged by his ability to rival the craftiness of the
                                         gods, stealing some of their divine power by matching them in wits and de-
                                         ception. Deception is a developed art of civilization and the most potent
                                         weapon in the game of power.

         ;'     PREFACE
    You cannot succeed at deception unless you take a somewhat dis-
tanced approach to yourself——-unless you can be many different people,
wearing the mask that the day and the moment require. With such a flexi«
ble approach to all appearances, including your own, you lose a lot of the
inward heaviness that holds people down. Make your face as malleable as
the actor’s, work to conceal your intentions from others, practice luring
people into traps. Playing with appearances and mastering arts of decep
tion are among the aesthetic pleasures of life. They are also key compo«
nents in the acquisition of power.
     If deception is the most potent weapon in your arsenal, then patience
in all things is your crucial shield. Patience will protect you from making
moronic blunders, Like mastering your emotions, patience is           :1   skill-—it
does not come naturally. But nothing about power is natural; power is
more   godlike than anything in the natural world. And patience is the
supreme virtue of the gods, who have nothing but time. Everything good
will happen——-the grass will grow again, if you give it time and see several

steps into the future. Impatience, on the other hand, only makes you look
weak. It is a. principal impediment to power.
     Power is essentially amoral and one of the most important skills to ac~
quire is the ability to see circumstances rather than good or evil. Power is a
game—-this cannot be repeated too often—and in games you do not judge
your opponents by their intentions but by the effect of their actions. You
measure their
             strategy and their power by what you can see and feel. How
often are someone’s intentions made the issue only to cloud and deceive!
What does it matter if another player, your friend or rival, intended good
things and had only your interests at heart, if the effects of his action lead to
so much min and confusion? It is
                                      only natural for people to cover up their
actions with all kinds of justifications, always assuming that they have acted
out of goodness. You must learn to inwardly laugh each time you hear this
and never get caught up in gauging someone’s intentions and actions
through a set of moral judgments that are really an excuse for the accumu-
lation of power.
    It is a game. Your opponent sits opposite you. Both of you behave as
gentlemen or ladies, observing the rules of the game and taking nothing
personally. You play with a strategy and you observe your opponent’s
moves with as much    calmness as you can muster. In the end, you will ap-

preciate the politeness of those you are playing with more than their good
 and sweet intentions. Train your eye to follow the results of their moves,
 the outward circumstances, and do not be distracted by anything else.
     Half of your mastery of power comes from what you do not do, what
 you do not allow yourself to get dragged into. For this skill you must learn
 to judge all things by what they cost you. As Nietzsche wrote, “The value of
 a
   thing sometimes lies not in what one attains with it, but in what one pays          l




 for it——what it costs us.” Perhaps you will attain your goal, and a worthy goal
 at that, but at what   price? Apply this standard to everything, including
 whether to collaborate with other  people or come to their aid. In the end,

                                                                                           PREFACE   .
                                                                                                         mi
                            life is short, opportunities are few, and you have only so much energy to
                            draw on. And in this sense time is as important a consideration as any
                            other. Never waste valuable time, or mental peace of mind, on the affairs of
                            others—that is too high a price to pay.
                                 Power is a social game. To learn and master it, you must develop the

                            ability to study and understand people. As the great seventeenth-century
                            thinker and courtier Baltasar Gracién wrote: “Many people spend time
                            studying the properties of animals or herbs; how much more important it
                            would be to study those of people, with whom we must live or die!” To be a
                            master player you must also be a master psychologist. You must recognize

                            motivations and see through the cloud of dust with which people surround
                            their actions. An understanding of people’s hidden motives is the single

                            greatest piece of knowledge you can have in acquiring power. It opens up
                            endless possibilities of deception, seduction, and manipulation.
                                 People are of infinite complexity and you can spend a lifetime watch-
                            ing them   without ever fully understanding them. So it is all the more im-
                            portant, then, to begin your education now. In doing so you must also keep
                            one
                                  principle in mind: Never discriminate as to whom you study and

                 r“'"”‘fi   whom you trust. Never trust anyone completely and study everyone, in-

                            cluding friends and loved ones.
                                 Finally, you must learn always to take the indirect route to power. Dis-
                            guise your cunning. Like a billiard ball that caroms several times before it
                            hits its target, your moves must be planned and developed in the least ob
                            vious way. By training yourself to be indirect, you can thrive in the modern
                            court, appearing the paragon of decency while being the consummate ma-
                            nipulator.

                            Consider The 48 Laws of Power a kind of handbook on the arts of indirec»
                            tion. The laws are based on the writings of men and women who have
                            studied and mastered the game of power. These writings span a period of
                            more   than three thousand years and were created in civilizations as dis»

                            parate as ancient China and Renaissance Italy; yet they share common
                            threads and themes, together hinting at an essence of power that has yet to
                            be fully articulated. The 48 laws of power are the distillation of this accu-
                            mulated wisdom, gathered from the writings of the most illustrious strate
                            gists (Sun-tzu, Clausewitz), statesmen (Bismarck, Talleyrand), courtiers
                            (Castiglione, Gracién), seducers (Ninon de Lenclos, Casanova), and con
                            artists (“Yellow Kid” Weil) in history.
                                  The laws have a simple premise: Certain actions almost always in-
                            crease one’s power (the observance of the law), while others decrease it

                            and even ruin us (the transgression of the law). These transgressions and
                            observances are illustrated by historical examples. The laws are timeless
                            and definitive.
                                 T7ze 48 Laws ofPower can be used in several ways. By reading the book
                            straight through you can learn about power in general. Although several of
                            the laws may seem not to pertain directly to your life, in time you will

      The book has also been designed for browsing and for examining the
law that seems at that particular moment most pertinent to you. Say you
are
      experiencing problems with a superior and cannot understand why
your efforts have not lead to more gratitude or a promotion. Several laws
specifically address the master-underling relationship, and you are almost
certainly transgressing one of them. By browsing the initial paragraphs for
the 48 laws in the table of contents, you can identify the pertinent law.
      Finally, the book can be browsed through and picked apart for enter-
tainrnent. for an enjoyable ride through the foibles and great deeds of our
predecessors in power. A warning, however, to those who use the book for
 this purpose: It might be better to tum back. Power is endlessly seductive
 and deceptive in its own way. It is a 1abyrinth—your mind becomes con-
 sumed with solving ifs infinite problems, and you soon realize how pleas-
 antly lost you have become. In other words, it becomes most amusing by
 taking it seriously. Do not be frivolous with such a critical matter. The gods
 of power frown on the frivolous; they give ultimate satisfaction only to
 those who study and reflect, and punish those who skim the surfaces look-
 ing for a good time.

      Any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin
      among the great number who are not good. Hence :2 prince who wants

            TRANSCRESSION OF THE LAW
            Nicolas Fouquet, Louis XIV’s finance minister in the first years of his reign,
            was a
                  generous man who loved lavish parties, pretty women, and poetry.
            He also loved money, for he led an extravagant lifestyle. Fouquet was
            clever and very much indispensable to the king, so when the prime mim's—
            ter, Jules Mazarin, died, in 1661, the finance minister expected to be
            named the successor. Instead, the king decided to abolish the position. This
            and other signs made Fouquet suspect that he was falling out of favor, and
            so he decided to
                             ingraliate himself with the king by staging the most spec-
            tacular party the world had ever seen. The party’s ostensible purpose
            would be to commemorate the completion of Fouquet’s chateau, Vaux—le-
            Vicomte, but its real function was to pay tribute to the king, the guest of
            honor.
                The most brilliant nobility of Europe and some of the greatest minds
            of the Iime—La Fontaine, La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Sévigné—
            attended the party. Moliere wrote a play for the occasion, in which he
            himself was to perform at the evening’s conclusion. The party began with a
            lavish   seven—course   dinner, featuring foods from the Orient never be-
            fore tasted in France, as well as new dishes created especially for the night.
            The meal     was
                               accompanied with music commissioned by Fouquet to
            honor the king.
                After dinner there was a promenade through the chateau’s gardens.
            The grounds and fountains of Vaux—le»Vicomte were to be the inspiration
            for Versailles.

                 Fouquet personally accompanied the young king through the geomet-
            rically aligned arrangements of shrubbery and flower beds. Arriving at the
            gardens’ canals, they witnessed a fireworks display, which was followed by
            the performance of Moliere’s play. The party ran well into the night and
            everyone agreed it was the most amazing affair they had ever attended.
                 The next day, Fouquet was arrested by the king’s head musketeer,

            D’Artagna.n. Three months later he went on trial for stealing from the
            country’s treasury. (Actually, most of the stealing he was accused of he had
            done on the kings behalf and with the king’s permission.) Fouquet was
            found guilty and sent to the most isolated prison in France, high in the
            Pyrenees Mountains, where he spent the last twenty years of his life in soli-
            tary confinement.

            Interpretation
            Louis XIV, the Sun King, was a proud and arrogant man who wanted to be
            the center of attention at all times; he could not countenance being out-
            done in lavishness by anyone, and certainly not his finance minister. To
            succeed Fouquet, Louis chose _]ean—Baptiste Colbert, a man famous for his
            parsimony and for giving the dullest parties in Paris. Colbert made sure
            that any money liberated from the treasury went straight into Louis’s
            hands. With the money, Louis built a palace even more magnificent than
            Fouquet’s—the glorious palace of Versailles. He used the same architects,

9   LAW 1
decorators, and garden designer. And at Versailles, Louis hosted parties
even more
            extravagant than the one that cost Fouquet his freedom.
    Let us examine the situation. The evening of the party, as Fouquet pre-
sented spectacle on spectacle to Louis, each more magnificent than the one
before, he imagined the affair as demonstrating his loyalty and devotion to
the king. Not only did he think the party would put him back in the king’s
favor, he thought it would show his good taste, his connections, and his
popularity, making him indispensable to the king and demonstrating that
he would make an excellent prime minister. Instead, however, each new

spectacle, each appreciative smile bestowed by the guests on Fouquet,
made it seem to Louis that his own friends and subjects were more
charmed by the finance minister than by the king himself, and that Fouquet
was
    actually flauming his wealth and power. Rather than flattering Louis
XXV, Fouquet’s elaborate party offended the king’s vanity. Louis would not
admit this to anyone, of course-—-instead, he found a convenient excuse to
rid himself of a man who had inadvertently made him feel insecure.
    Such is the fate, in some form or other, of all those who unbalance the
master’s sense of self, poke holes in his vanity, or make him doubt his pro
eminence.


            When the wming began, Fouquet was at the to}: of the world.

                  By the time it had ended, he was at the bottom.
                                Voltaire, 16.944 778




OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the    early 1600s, the Italian astronomer and mathematician Galileo
found himself in a precarious position. He depended on the generosity of

great rulers to support his research, and so, like all Renaissance scientists,
he would sometimes make gifts of his inventions and discoveries to the
leading patrons of the time. Once, for instance, he presented a militaiy
compass he had invented to the Duke of Gonzaga. Then he dedicated a
book explaining the use of the compass to the Medicis. Both rulers were
grateful, and through them Galileo was able to find more students to teach.
No matter how great the discovery, however, his patrons usually paid him
with gifts, not cash. This made for a life of constant insecurity and depen-
dence. There must be an easier way, he thought.
    Galileo hit on a new strategy in l6l0, when he discovered the moons
of Jupiter. Instead of dividing the discovery among his patrons—giving
one the
          telescope he had used, dedicating a book to another, and so on—as
he had done in the past, he decided to focus exclusively on the Medicis. He
 chose the Medicis for one reason: Shortly after Cosimo I had established
 the Medici dynasty, in 1540, he had made Jupiter, the mightiest of the
 gods, the Medici symbol—a symbol of a. power that went beyond politics
 and banking, one linked to ancient Rome and its divinities.
     Galileo turned his discovery of _]upiter’s moons into a cosmic event


                                                                                 LAW 1   33
                 honoring the Medicis’ greatness. Shortly after the discovery, he announced
                 that “the bright stars [the moons of jupiterl offered themselves in the heav~
                 ens” to his telescope at the same time as Cosimo II’s enthronement. He
                 said that the number of the moons-—-four——harmonized with the number of
                 the Medicis (Cosimo II had three brothers) and that the moons orbitecl
                 Jupiter as these four sons revolved around Cosimo I, the dynasty’ s founder.
                 More than coincidence, this showed that the heavens themselves reflected
                 the ascendancy of the Medici family. After he dedicated the discovery to
                 the Medicis, Galileo commissioned an emblem representing Jupiter sitting
                 on a   cloud with the four stars circling about him, and presented this to
                 Cosimo II as a symbol of his link to the stars.
                     In 1610 Cosimo II made Galileo his official court philosopher and
                 mathematician, with a full salary. For a scientist this was the coup of a life»
                 time. The days of begging for patronage were over.


                 Interpretation
                 In one stroke, Galileo gained more with his new strategy than he had in

                 years of begging. The reason is simple: All masters want to appear more
                 brilliant than other people.
                      They do not care about science or empirical tmth or the latest inven~
                 tion; they care about their name and their glory. Galileo gave the Medicis
                 infinitely more glory by linking their name with cosmic forces them he had
                 by making them the patrons of some new scientific gadget or discovery.
                      Scientists are not spared the vagaries of court life and patronage. They
                 too must serve masters who hold the purse strings. And their great intellec-

                 tual powers can make the master feel insecure, as if he were only there to
                 supply the funds~—an ugly, ignoble job. The producer of a great work
                 wants to feel he is more than just the provider of the financing. He wants to

                 appear creative and powerful, and also more important than the work pro~
                 duoed in his name. Instead of insecurity you must give him glory. Galileo
                 did not challenge the intellectual authority of the Medicis with his discov~
                 ery, or make them feel inferior in any way; by literally aligning them with
                 the stars, he made them shine brilliantly among the courts of Italy. He did
                 not outshine the master, he made the master outshine all others.




                 KEYS TO POWER
                 Everyone has insecurities. When you show yourself in the world and dis-
                 play your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentment, envy, and
                 other manifestations of insecurity. This is to be expected. You cannot spend
                 your life worrying about the petty feelings of others. With those above you,
                 however, you must take a different approach: When it comes to power,
                 outshining the master is perhaps the worst mistake of all.
                      Do not fool yourself into thinking that life has changed much since the
                 days of Louis XIV and the Medicis. Those who attain high standing in life
                 are like
                          kings and queens: They want to feel secure in their positions, and

-1’   ,
          LAW]
superior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and charm. It is a. deadly
but common misperception to believe that by displaying and vaunting
your gifts and talents, you are winning the master’s affection. He may feign
appreciation, but at his first opportunity he will replace you with someone
less intelligent, less attractive, less threatening, just as Louis XIV replaced
the sparkling Fouquet with the bland Colbert. And as with Louis, he will
not admit the tmth, but will find an excuse to rid himself of your presence.
      This Law involves two rules that you must realize, First, you can inad-

vertently outshine a master simply by being yourself. There are masters
who are more insecure than others, nronstrously insecure; you may natu-
rally outshine them by your charm and grace.
      No one had more natural talents than Astorre Manfredi, prince of
Faenza. The most handsome of all the young princes of Italy, he captivated
his subjects with his generosity and open spirit.
    In the year 1500, Cesare Borgia laid siege to Faenza. When the city
surrendered, the citizens expected the worst from the cruel Borgia, who,
however, decided to spare the town: He simply occupied its fortress, exe-
cuted none of its citizens, and allowed Prince Manfredi, eighteen at the
time, to remain with his court, in complete freedom.
    A few weeks later, though, soldiers hauled Astorre Manfredi away to a
Roman prison. A year after that, his body was fished out of the River
Tiber, a stone tied around his neck. Borgia justified the horrible deed with
some sort   of tmmped~up charge of treason and conspiracy, but the real
problem    wasthat he was notoriously vain and insecure. The young man
was
    outshining him without even trying. Given Manfredi’s natural talents,
the prince’s mere presence made Borgia seem less attractive and charis-
matic. The lesson is simple: If you cannot help being charming and supe~
not, you must learn to avoid sud: monsters of vanity. Either that, or find a
way to mute your good qualities when in the company of a Cesare Borgia.
      Second, never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do
anything you want. Entire books could be written about favorites who fell
out of favor by taking their status for granted, for daring to outshine. In

late-sixteentbcenturyjapan, the favorite of Emperor Hideyoshi was a man
called Sen no Rikyu. The premier artist of the tea ceremony, which had be-
come an obsession with the
                                nobility, he was one of Hideyoshi’s most
trusted advisers, had his own apartment in the palace, and was honored
throughout japan. Yet in 1591, Hideyoshi had him arrested and sentenced
to death. Rikyu took his own life, instead. The cause for his sudden change
of fortune was discovered later: It seems that Rikyu, former peasant and
later court favorite, had had a wooden statue made of himself wearing san-
dals (a Sign of nobility) and posing loftily. He had had this statue placed in
the most important temple inside the palace gates, in clear sight of the roy-

alty who often would pass by. To Hidcyoshi this signified that Rikyu had
no sense of limits.
                    Presurning that he had the same rights as those of the
highest nobility, he had forgotten that his position depended on the em»

peror, and had come to believe that he had earned it on his own. This was


                                                                                  LAW 1
            an  unforgivable miscalculation of his own importance and he paid for it
            with his life. Remember the       following: Never take your position for
            granted  and never let
                                    any favors you receive go to your head.
                  Knowing the dangers of outshining your master, you can turn this Law
            to your advantage. First you must flatter and puff up your master. Overt

            flattery can be effective but has its limits; it is too direct and obvious, and
            looks bad to other courtiers. Discreet flattery is much more powerful. If
            you are more intelligent than your master, for example, seem the opposite:
            Make him appear more intelligent than you. Act naive. Make it seem that
            you need his expertise. Commit harmless mistakes that will not hurt you in
            the long run but will give you the chance to ask for his help. Masters adore
            such requests. A master who cannot bestow on you the               of his experi-
            ence
                 may direct rancor and ill will at you instead.
                If your ideas are more creative than your master’s, ascribe them to
            him, in as public a manner as possible. Make it clear that your advice is
            merely an echo of his advice.
                  If you surpass your master in wit, it is okay to play the role of the court

            jester, but do not make him appear cold and surly by comparison. Tone
            down your humor if necessary, and find ways to make him seem the dis-
            penser of amusement and good cheer. If you are naturally more sociable
            and generous than your master, be careful not to be the cloud that blocks
            his radiance from others. He must appear as the sun around which every-
            one revolves, radiating power and brilliance, the center of attention. If you
            are thrust into the
                                position of entertaining him, a display of your limited
            means
                   may win you his sympathy. Any attempt to impress him with your
            grace and generosity can prove fatal: Learn from Fouquet or pay the price.
                  In all of these cases it is not a weakness to disguise your strengths if
            in the end they lead to power. By letting others outshine you, you remain
            in control, instead of being a victim of their insecurity. This will all come in

            handy the day you decide to rise above your inferior status. If, like Galileo,
            you can make your master shine even more in the eyes of others, then you
            are a

6   LAW 1
Authority: Avoid outsliining the master. All superiority is odious, but the
superiority of a subject over his prince is not only stupid, it. is fatal. This is a
lesson that the stars in the sky Leach us-—--they may be related to the sun,
and just as brilliant, but they never appear in her company. (Baltasar
Grzutifm, llilll-I658}


REVERSAI.
You cannot worry about upsetting every person you come across, but you
must be   selectively cruel. If your superior is a falling star, there is nothing
to fear from outshining him. Do not be merciful-—-your master had no such

scruples in his own cold—blooded climb to the top. Gauge his strength. If he
is weak, discreetly hasten his downfall: Outclo, outchann, outsmart him at

key moments. If he is very weak and ready to fall, let nature take its course.
Do not risk outshining a feeble superior--it might appear cruel or spiteful.
But if your master is firm in his position, yet you know yourself to be the
more
       capable, hide your time and be patient. It is the natural course of
things that power eventually fades and weakens. Your master will fall
someday, and if you play it right, you will outlive and someday outshine
him.

                                        imagine. Friends often agree on things in order to avoid an argument.

     As Lincoln said, you destroy an enemy when you make a friend of
him. In 1971, during the Vietnam War, Henry Kissinger was the target of
an unsuccessful
                  kidnapping attempt, a conspiracy involving, among others,
the renowned antiwar activist priests the Berrigan brothers, four more
Catholic priests, and four nuns. In private, without informing the Secret
Service or the justice Department, Kissinger arranged a Saturday-morning
meeting with three of the alleged kidnappers. Explaining to his guests that
he would have most American soldiers out of Vietnam by mid-1972, he

completely charmed them. They gave him some “Kidnap Kissinger” but»
tons and one of them remained a friend of his for years,
                                                            visiting him on
several occasions. This was not just 8. onetime ploy: Kissinger made a pol-
icy of working with those who disagreed with him. Colleagues commented
that he seemed to get along better with his enemies than with his friends.
    Without enemies around us, we grow lazy. An enemy at our heels

sharpens our wits, keeping us focused and alert. It is sometimes better,
                                                                                                LAW 2               13

             or allies.

                  Mao Tse-tung saw conflict as key in his approach to power. In 1937 the
             Japanese invaded China, i.nte.rrupi:i:ug the aim‘! war between Mods Com-
             munists and their enemy, the Nationalists.

                 Fearing that the Japanese would wipe them out, some Communist
             leaders advocated leaving the Nationalists to fight the Japanese, and using
             the time to recuperate. Mao disagreed: The Japanese could not possibly
             defeat and occupy a vast country like China for long. Once they left, the
             Communists would have grown rusty if they had been out of combat for
             several years, and would be ill prepared to reopen their struggle with the
             Nationalists. To fight a formidable foe like the Japanese, in fact, would be
             the perfect training for the Communists’ ragtag army. Mao’s plan was
             adopted, and it worked: By the time the Japanese finally retreated, the
             Communists had gained the fighting experience that helped them defeat
             the Nationalists.
                  Years later, aJapanese visitor tried to apologize to Mao for his coun-

             try’s invasion of China. Mao interrupted, “Should I not thank you in»
             stead?” Without a worthy opponent, he explained, a man or group cannot
             grow stronger.
                 Mao’s strategy of constant conflict has several key components. First,
             be certain that in the long run you will emerge victorious. Never pick a
             fight with someone you are not sure you can defeat, as Mao knew the
             Japanese would be defeated in time. Second, if you have no apparent ene-
             mies, you must sometimes set up a convenient target, even turning a friend
             into an enemy. Mao used this tactic time and again in politics. Third, use
             such enemies to define your cause more clearly to the public, even framing
             it as a struggle of good against evil. Mao actually encouraged Chi.na’s dis

             agreements with the Soviet Union and the United States; without clear-cut
             enemies, he believed, his people would lose any sense of what Chinese
             Communism meant A sharply defined enemy is a far stronger argument
             for your side than all the words you could possibly put together.
                 Never let the presence of enemies upset or distress you—you are far
             better off with a declared opponent or two than not knowing where your
             real enemies lie. The man of power welcomes conflict, using enemies to
             enhance his reputation as a surefoobed fighter who can be relied upon in
             times of uncertainty.

REVE RSA L

Although it is generally best not to mix work with friendship, there are
times when a friend can be used to greater effect than an enemy. A man of

power, for example, often has dirty work that has to be done, but for the
sake of appearances it is generally preferable to have other people do it for
him; friends often do this the best, since their afiection for him makes them
willing to take chances. Also, if your plans go awry for some reason, you
can use a friend as a convenient
                                   scapegoat. This “fall of the favorite” was a
trick often used by kings and sovereigns: They would let their closest friend
at court take the fall for a mistake, since the public would not believe that

they would deliberately sacrifice a friend for such a purpose. Of course,
after you play that card, you have lost your friend forever. It is best, then, to
reserve   the scapegoat role for someone who is close to you but not too
close.
     Finally, the problem about working with friends is that it confuses the
boundaries and distances that working requires. But if both partners in the
 arrangement understand the dangers involved, a friend often can be em-
 ployed to great effect. You must never let your guard down in such a ven-
 ture, however; always be on the lookout for any signs of emotional
 disturbance such as envy and ingratitude. Nothing is stable in the realm of
 power, and even the closest of friends can be transformed into the worst of
 enernies.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Over several weeks, Ninon de Lenclos, the most infamous courtesan of
seventeentlrcentury France, listened patiently as the Marquis de Sevigné
explained his struggles in pursuing a beautiful but difficult young countess.
N inon was sixty~two at the time, and more than experienced in matters of
love; the marquis was a lad of twenty-two, handsome, dashing, but hope
lessly inexperienced in romance. At first Ninon was amused to hear the
marquis talk about his mistakes, but finally she had had enough. Unable to
bear ineptitude in any realm, least of all in seducing a woman, she decided
to take the young man under her wing. First, he had to understand that this

was   war, and that the beautiful countess was {citadel to which he had to
lay siege as carefully as any general. Every step had to be planned and exe-
cuted with the utmost attention to detail and nuance.
      Instructing the marquis to start over, Ninon told him to approach the
countess with a bit of distance, an air of nonchalance. The next time the
two were alone    together, she said, he would confide in the countess as
would a friend but notva potential lover. This was to throw her off the scent.
The countess was no longer to take his interest in her for granted-perhaps
he was only interested in friendship.
      Ninon planned ahead. Once the countess was confused, it would be
time to make her jealous. At the next encounter, at a major féte in Paris, the

marquis would show up with a beautiful young woman at his side. This
beautiful young woman had equally beautiful friends, so that wherever the
countess would now see the marquis, he would be surrounded by the most

stunning young women in Paris. Not only would the countess be seething
with jealousy, she would come to see the marquis as someone who was de-
sired by others. It was hard for Ninon to make the marquis understand, but
she patiently explained that a woman who is interested in a man wants to
see   that other women are interested in him, too. Not only does that give
him instant value, it makes it all the more satisfying to snatch him from
their clutches.
     Once the countess was jealous but intrigued, it would be time to be-
guile her. On Ninon’s instructions, the marquis would fail to show up at af-
fairs where the countess expected to see him. Then, suddenly, he would

appear at salons he had never frequented before, but that the countess at-


                                                                                 LAW 3   I7
             tended often. She would be unable to predict his moves. All of this would
             push her into the state of emotional confusion that is a prerequisite for sum
             cessful seduction.
                     These moves were executed, and took several weeks. Ninon moni-
             tored the marquis’s progress: Through her network of spies, she heard how
             the countess would laugh a little harder at his witticisms, listen more
             closely to his stories. She heard that the countess was suddenly asking ques-
             tions about him. Her friends told her that at social affairs the countess
             would often look up at the marquis, following his steps. Ninon felt certain
             that the young woman was falling under his spell. It was a matter of weeks
             now,     maybe a month or two, but if all went smoothly, the citadel would
             fall.
                     A few days later the marquis was at the countess’s home. They were
             alone. Suddenly he was a different man: This time acting on his own im—
             pulse, rather than following Ninon’s instructions, he took the countess’s
             hands and told her he was in love with her. The young woman seemed
             confused, 3 reaction he did not expect. She became polite, then excused
             herself. For the rest of the evening she avoided his eyes, was not there to

             say goodnight to him. The next few times he visited he was told she was
             not at home. When she  finally admitted him again, the two felt awkward
             and uncomfortable with each other. The spell was broken.


             Interpretation
             Ninon de Lenclos knew everything about the art of love. The greatest writ-
             ers, thinkers, and   politicians of the time had been her lovers——men like La
             Rochefoucauld, Moliére, and Richelieu. Seduction was a game to her, to be
             practiced with skill. As she got older, and her reputation grew, the most im~
             portant families in France would send their sons to her to be instructed in
             matters of love.
                     Ninon knew that men and women are very different, but when it
             comes to seduction    they feel the same: Deep down inside, they often sense
             when they are being seduced, but they give in because they enjoy the feel-
             ing of being led along. It is a pleasure to let go, and to allow the other per-
             son to detour
                              you into a strange country. Everything in seduction,
             however, depends on suggestion. You cannot announce your intentions or
             reveal them directly in words. Instead you must throw your targets off the
             scent. To surrender to your   guidance they must be appropriately confused.
             You have to scramble your signals——~appea.r interested in another man or
             woman    (the decoy), then hint at being interested in the target, then feign
             indifference, on and on. Such patterns not only confuse, they excite.
                  Imagine this story from the countess’s perspective: After a few of the
             marquis’s moves, she sensed the marquis was playing some sort of game,
             but the game delighted her. She did not know where he was leading her,
             but so much the better. His moves intrigued her, each of them keeping her
             waiting for the next one———she even enjoyed her jealousy and confusion, for
             sometimes any emotion is be-tier than the boredom of security. Perhaps the

             marquis had ulterior motives; most men do. But she was willing to wait and
18   LAW 3
see, and   probably if she had been made to wait long enough, what he was
up to would not have mattered.
      The moment the marquis uttered that fatal word “love,” however, all
was
    changed. This was no longer a game with moves, it was an artless show
of passion. His intention was revealed: He was seducing her. This put

everything he had done in a new light. All that before had been charming
now   seemed ugly and conniving; the countess felt embarrassed and used.
A door closed that would never open again.


Do not be held a cheat, even though 2'! is impossible to live today without being one.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 1850 the young Otto von Bismarck, then a thirty—five—yearvold deputy in
the Prussian parliament, was at a turning point in his career. The issues of
the day were the unification of the many states (including Prussia) into
which Germany was then divided, and a war against Austria, the powerful
neighbor to the south that hoped to keep the Germans weak and at odds,
even
       threatening to intervene if they tried to unite. Prince William, next in
line to be P:ussia’s king, was in favor of going to war, and the parliament
rallied to the cause, prepared to back any mobilization of troops. The only
ones to
          oppose war were the present king, Frederick William IV, and his
ministers, who preferred to appease the powerful Austrians.
      Throughout his career, Bismarck had been a loyal, even passionate
supporter of Prussian might and power. He dreamed of German unifica-
tion, of going to war against Austria and humiliating the country that for so
long had kept Germany divided. A former soldier, he saw warfare as a glo-
rious business.

     This, after all, was the man who years later would say, “The great
questions of the time will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions, but
by iron and blood.”
     Passionate patriot and lover of military glory, Bismarck nevertheless
gave a speech in parliament at the height of the war fever that astonished
all who heard it “Woe unto the statesman,” he said, “who makes war with-
out a reason that will still be valid when the war is over! After the war, you

will all look differently at these questions. Will you then have the courage
to turn to the
                 peasant contemplating the ashes of his farm, to the man who
has been crippled, to the father who has lost his children?” Not only did
Bismarck go on to talk of the madness of this war, but, strangest of all, he
praised Austria and defended her actions. This went against everything he
had stood for. The consequences were immediate. Bismarck was against
the wa.r——what could this possibly mean? Other deputies were confused,
and several of them changed their votes. Eventually the king and his minis-
ters won out, and war was averted.
      A few weeks after Bisma.rck’s infamous speech, the king, grateful that

                                                                                         LAW 3   19
             he had spoken for peace, made him a cabinet minister. A few years later he
             became the Prussian premier. In this role he eventually led his country and
             a.
                  peace-loving king into a war against Austria, crushing the former empire
             and establishing a           German state, with Prussia at its head.


             lnterpretation
             At the time of his speech in 1850, Bismarck made several calculations.
             First, he sensed that the Prussian military, which had not kept pace with
             other European armies, was unready for war--that Austria, in fact, might
             very well win, a disastrous result for the future. Second, if the war were lost
             and Bismarck had supported it, his career would be gravely jeopardized.
             The king and his conservative ministers wanted peace; Bismarck wanted

             power. The answer was to throw people off the scent by supporting a cause
             he cletested, saying things he would laugh at if said by another. A whole
             country was fooled. It was because of Bismarck’s speech that the king made
             him a minister, at position from which he quickly rose to be prime minister,

             attaining the power to strengthen the Prussian military and accomplish
             what he had wanted all along: the humiliation of Austria and the unifica»
             tion of Germany under Prussia’s leadership.
                    Bismarck was certainly one of the cleverest statesman who ever lived,
             a master  of strategy and deception. No one suspected what he was up to in
             this case. Had he announced his real intentions, arguing that it was better
             to wait now and fight later, he would not have won the argument, since
             most Prussians wanted war at that moment and mistakenly believed that
             their army was superior to the Austrians. Had he played up to the king,
             asking to be made a minister in exchange for supporting peace, he would
             not have succeeded either: The king would have distrusted his ambition

             and doubted his sincerity.
                 By being completely insincere and sending misleading signals, how-
             ever, he deceived everyone, concealed his purpose, and attained every-
             thing he wanted. Such is the power of hiding your intentions.



             KEYS TO POWER
             Most people are open books. They say what they feel, blurt out their opin-
             ions at every opportunity, and constantly reveal their plans and intentions.

             They do this for several reasons. First, it is easy and natural to always want
             to talk about one’s feelings and plans for the future. It takes effort to control

             your tongue and monitor what you reveal. Second, many believe that by
             being honest and open they are winning people's hearts and showing their
             good nature.They are greatly deluded. Honesty is actually a blunt instru-
             ment, which bloodies more than it cuts. Your honesty is likely to offend
             people; it is much more prudent to tailor your words, telling people what
             they want to hear rather than the coarse and ugly truth of what you feel or
             think. More important, by being unabashedly open you make yourself so
             predictable and familiar that it is almost impossible to respect or fear you,
             and power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such emotions.

20   LAW 3
    If you yearn for power, quickly lay honesty aside, and train yourself in
the art of concealing your intentions. Master the art and you will always
have the upper hand. Basic to an ability to conceal one’s intentions is a
simple tmth about human nature: Our first instinct is to always trust ap-
pearances. We cannot go around doubting the reality of what we see and
hear—-constantly imagining that appearances concealed something else
would exhaust and terrify us. This fact makes it relatively easy to conceal
one’s intentions. Simply dangle an object you seem to desire, a goal you
seem to aim for, in front of
                             people’s eyes and they will take the appearance
for reality. Once their eyes focus on the decoy, they will fail to notice what
you are really up to. In seduction, set up conflictinghsignals, such as desire
and indiiference, and you not only throw them off the scent, you inflame
their desire to possess you.
      A tactic that is often effective in setting up a red herring is to appear to

support an idea or cause that is actually contrary to your own sentiments.
(Bismarck used this to great effect in his speech in 1850.) Most people will
believe you have experienced a change of heart, since it is so unusual to

play so lightly with something as emotional as one’s opinions and values.
The same applies for any decoyed object of desire: Seem to want some-
thing in which you are actually not at all interested and your enemies will
be thrown oil the scent. making all kinds of errors in their calculations.
     During the War of the Spanish Succession in 1711, the Duke of Marl-
borough, head of the English army, wanted to destroy a key French fort,
because it protected a vital thoroughfare into France. Yet he knew that if be

destroyed it, the French would realize what he wanted-to advance down
that road. Instead, then, he merely captured the fort, and garrisoned it with
some of his troops, making it
                               appear as if he wanted it for some purpose of
his own. The French attacked the fort and the duke let them recapture it.
Once they had it back, though, they destroyed it, figuring that the duke had
wanted it for some important reason. Now that the fort was gone, the road
was

     Use this tactic in the following manner: Hide your intentions not by
closing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people suspi-
cious) but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals—~just not your
real ones. You will kill three birds with one stone: You appear friendly,
open, and trusting; you conceal your intentions; and you send your rivals
on timeconsuming wild~goose chases.

     Another powerful tool in throwing people oh’ the scent is false sincer-
ity. People easily mjstake sincerity for honesty. Remember-their first in
stinct is to trust appearances, and since they value honesty and want to
believe in the honesty of those around them, they will rarely doubt you or
see through your act. Seeming to believe what you
                                                         say gives your words
great weight.   This is how  Iago deceived and  destroyed Othello: Given the
depth   of his emotions,  the apparent sincerity of his concerns about Desde—
rnona’s supposed infidelity, how could Othello distrust him? This is also
how the great con artist Yellow Kid Weil pulled the wool over suckers’
eyes: Seeming to believe so deeply in the decayed object he was dangling

                       cexity is a tricky tool: Appear overpassionate and you raise suspicions. Be
                       measured and believable or your ruse will seem the put-on that it is.
                           To make your false sincerity an effective weapon in concealing your
                       intentions, espouse a belief in honesty and fertlirightness as important so-
                       cial values. Do this as publicly as possible. Emphasize your position on this
                       subject by occasionally divulging some heartfelt thought-though only one
                       that is actually meaningless or irrelevant, of course. Napoleon"; minister
                       Talleyrand was a master at taking people into his confidence by revealing
                       some apparent secret. This feigned confidence——a decoy—-would then

                       elicit a real confidence on the other person’s part.

                       their dishonesty in others. Honesty is merely another decoy in their arsenal

The Yellow Kid had staked out Geezil as the perfect sucker long before he
set up the con. He knew the         boxingmatch scam would be the perfect ruse
toseparate Geezil from his money quickly and definitively. But he also
knew that if he had begun by trying to interest Geezil in the boxing match,
he would have failed miserably. He had to conceal his intentions and
switch attention, create a smoke screen-—-in this case the sale of the lodge.
     On the train ride and in the hotel room Geezil’s mind had been com-
pletely occupied with the pending deal, the easy money, the chance to
hobnob with wealthy men. He had failed to notice that Gross was out of
shape and middle-aged at best. Such is the distracting power of a smoke
screen. Engrossed in the business deal, Gee-zil’s attention was easily di—

verted to the boxing match, but only at a point when it was already too late
for him to notice the details that would have given Gross away. The match,
after all, now depended on a bribe rather than on the boxer’s physical condi~
lion. And Geezil was so distracted at the end by the illusion of the boxer’s death
that he completely forgot about his money.
     Learn from the Yellow Kid: The familiar, inconspicuous front is the

perfect smoke screen. Approach your mark with an idea that seems ordi~
nary enough—a business deal, financial intrigue. The sucker’s mind is dis
tracted, his suspicions allayed. That is when you gently guide him onto the
second path, the slippery slope down which he slides helplessly into your
trap.


OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
In the mid-1920s, the powerful warlords of Ethiopia were coming to the re-
alization that a young man of the nobility named Haile Selassie, also
known as Ras Tafari, was outcompeting them all and nearing the point
where he could proclaim himself their leader, unifying the country for the
first time in decades. Most of his rivals could not understand how this

wispy,'quiet, mild—mannered man had been able to take control. Yet in
             1927, Selassie was able to summon the warlords, one at a time, to come to
             Amldis Ababa to declare their loyalty and recognize him as leader.
                 Some hurried, some hesitated, but only one, Dejazmach Balcha of
             Sidamo, dared defy Selassie totally. A blustery man, Balcha was a great
             warrior, and he considered the new leader weak and unworthy. He point-
             edly stayed away from the capital. Finally Selassie, in his gentle but stern
             way, commanded Balcha to come. The warlord decided to obey, but in
             doing so he would turn the tables on this pretender to the Ethiopian
             throne: He would come to Addis Ababa at his own speed, and with an
             army of 10,000 men, a. force large enough to defend himself, perhaps even
             start a civil war. Stationing this formidable force in a valley three miles
             from the capital, he waited, as a king would. Selassie would have to come
             to him.
                 Selassie did indeed send emissaries, asking Balcha to attend an after»
             noon
                      banquet in his honor. But Balcha, no fool, knew history—he knew
             that previous kings and lords of Ethiopia had used banquets       as   a
                                                                                        trap.
             Once he was there and full of drink, Selassie would have him arrested or
             murdered. To signal his understanding of the situation, he agreed to come
             to the   banquet, but only if he could bring his personal b0dyguaId—-500 of
             his best soldiers, all armed and ready to defend him and themselves. To
             Balcha’s    surprise, Selassie answered with the utmost politeness that he
             would be honored to play host to such warriors.
                On the way to the banquet, Balcha warned his soldiers not to get
             drunk and to be on their guard. When they arrived at the palace, Selassie
             was his
                      charming best. He deferred to Balcha, treated him as if he desper-
             ately needed his approval and cooperation. But Balcha refused to be
             charmed, and he warned Selassie that if he did not return to his camp by
             nightfall, his army had orders to attack the capital. Selassie reacted as if
             hurt by his mistrust. Over the meal, when it came time for the traditional
             singing of songs in honor of Ethiopia’s leaders, he made a. point of allowing
             only songs honoring the warlord of Sidarno. It seemed to Balcha that Se»
             lassie was scared, intimidated by this great warrior who could not be out-
             wittecl. Sensing the change, Balcha believed that he would be the one to
             call the shots in the days to come.
                  At the end of the afternoon, Balcha and his soldiers began their march
             back to camp amidst cheers and gun salutes. Looking back to the capital
             over his shoulder, he
                                      planned his strategy—-how his own soldiers would
             march through the capital in triumph within weeks, and Selassie would be
             put in his place, his place being either prison or death. When Balcha came
             in sight of his camp, however, he saw that something was terribly wrong.
             Where before there had been colorful tents stretching as far as the eye
             could see, now there was nothing, only smoke from doused fires. What
             devil’s magic was this?
                 A witness told Balcha what had happened. During the banquet, a large

             army, commanded by an ally of Selassie’s, had stolen up on Balcha’s en-
             campment by a side route he had not seen. This army had not come to
             light, however: Knowing that Balcha would/have heard a noisy battle and

hurried back with his 600-man bodyguard, Selassie had .armed his own
troops with baskets of gold and cash. They had surrounded Balcha’s army
and proceeded to purchase every last one of their weapons. Those who re»
fused were easily intimidated. Within a few hours, Balcha’s entire force had
been disarmed and scattered in all directions.
    Realizing his danger, Balcha decided to march south with his 600 sol-
diers to regroup, but the same army that had disarmed his soldiers blocked
his way. The other way out was to march on the capital, but Selassie had set
a
    large army to defend it. Like a chess player, he had predicted Balcha’s
moves, and had checkmatecl him. For the first time in his life, Balcha sur-
rendered. To repent his sins of pride and ambition, he agreed to enter a
                                                                              ‘




monastery.

Interpretation
Throughout Selassie’s long reign, no one could quite figure him out.
Ethiopians like their leaders fierce, but Selassie, who wore the front of a
gentle, peaceloving man, lasted longer than any of them. Never angry or
impatient, he lured his victims with sweet smiles, lulling them with charm
and obsequiousness before he attacked. In the case of Balcha, Selassie
played on the man’s wariness, his suspicion that the banquet was a trap—
which in fact it was, but not the one he expected. Selassie’s way of allaying
Balcha’s fears—letting him bring his bodyguard to the banquet, giving him
top billing there, making him feel in contro1—-created a thick smoke screen,
concealing the real action three miles away.
    Remember: The paranoid and wary are often the easiest to deceive.
Win their trust in one area and you have a smoke screen that blinds their
View in another, letting you creep up and level them with a devastating
blow. A helpful or apparently honest gesture, or one that implies the other
persorfs supen‘ority——these are perfect diversionary devices.
    Properly set up, the smoke screen is a weapon of great power. It en-
abled the gentle Selassie to totally destroy his enemy, without firing a single
bullet.

                Do not underestimate the power of Tafari. He creefis
                       like a mouse but he has jaws like a lion.

KEYS TO POWER
If you believe that deceivers are colorful folk who mislead with elaborate
lies and tall tales, you are greatly mistaken. The best deceivers utilize a
bland and inconspicuous front that calls no attention to themselves. They
know that extravagant words and gestures immediately raise suspicion. In-
stead, they envelop their marlc in the familiar, the banal, the ha.rmless. In
Yellow Kid Weil’s dealings with Sam Geezil, the familiar was a business
deal. In the Ethiopian case, it was Selassie’s misleading obsequiousness—
exactly what'Balcha. would have expected from a weaker warlord.
                                                                                        LAW 3   27
              Once you have lulled your suckers’ attention with the familiar, they
        will not notice the deception being perpetrated behind their backs. This
        derives from a simple truth: people can only focus on one thing at a time. It
        is really too difficult for them to imagine that the bland and harmless per~
        son
              they are dealing with is simultaneously setting up something else. The
        grayer and more uniform the smoke in your smoke screen, the better it
        conceals your intentions. In the decoy and red herring devices discussed in
        Part I, you actively distract people; in the smoke screen, you lull your vic-
        tims, drawing them into your web. Because it is so hypnotic, this is often
        the best way of concealing your intentions.
              The simplest form of smoke screen is facial expression. Behind a bland,
        unreadable exterior, all sorts of mayhem can be planned, without detection.
        This is a weapon that the most powerful men in history have learned to per-
        fect. It was said that no one could read Franklin D. Roosevelfs face. Baron

        james Rothschild made a lifelong practice of disguising his real thoughts be
         hind bland smiles and nondescript looks. Stendhal wrote of Talleyrand,
         “Never was a face less of a barometer.” Henry Kissinger would bore his op—

        ponents around the negotiating table to tears with his monotonous voice,
        his blank look, his endless recitations of details; then, as their eyes glazed
        over, he would    suddenly hit them with a list of bold terms. Caught off»
        guard, they would be easily intimidated. As one poker manual explains it,
        “While playing his hand, the good player is seldom an actor. Instead he
        practices a bland behavior that minimizes readable patterns, frustrates and
        confuses opponents, permits greater concentration,”
              An adaptable concept, the smoke screen can be practiced on a num-
        ber of levels, all playing on the psychological principles of distraction and
        misdirection. One of the most effective smoke screens is the noble gesture.
        People want to believe apparently noble gestures are genuine, for the belief
        is pleasant. They rarely notice how deceptive these gestures can be.
              The art dealerjoseph Duveen was once confronted with a terrible prob-
        lem. The millionaires who had paid so dearly for Duveen’s paintings were
        running out of wall space, and with inheritance taxes getting ever higher, it
        seemed unlikely that they would keep buying. The solution was the National
        Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., which Duveen helped create in 1937 by
        getting Andrew Mellon to donate his collection to it. The National Gallery
        was the
                perfect front for Duveen. In one gesture, his clients avoided taxes,
        cleared wall space for new purchases, and reduced the number of paintings
        on the market, maintaining the upward pressure on their prices. All this

        while the donors created the appearance of being public benefactors.
              Another effective smoke screen is the pattern, the establishment of a se
        ries of actions that seduce the victim into believing you will continue in the
        same way. The    pattern plays on the psychology of anticipation: Our behav~
        ior conforms to patterns, or so we like to think.
            In 1878 the American robber baronjay Gould created a company that

        began to threaten the monopoly of the telegraph company Western Union.
        The directors of Western Union decided to buy Gould’s company up-


LAW 3
they had to spend a hefty sum, but they figured they had managed to rid
themselves of an irritating competitor. A few months later, though, Gould
was it at again,
                  complaining he had been treated unfairly. He started up a
second company to compete with Western Union and its new acquisition.
The same thing happened again: Western Union bought him out to shut
him up. Soon the pattern began for the third time, but now Gould went for
the jugular: He suddenly staged a bloody takeover struggle and managed
to gain complete control of Western Union. He had established a pattern
that had tricked the company’s directors into thinking his goal was to be

bought out at a handsome rate. Once they paid him off, they relaxed and
failed to notice that he was actually playing for higher stakes. The pattern is

powerful in that it deceives the other person into expecting the opposite of
what you are really doing.

     Anotlier psychological weakness on which to construct a smoke screen
is the tendency to mistake appearances for reality-——the feeling that if some-
one seems to
               belong to your group, their belonging must be real. This habit
makes the seamless blend a very effective front. The trick is simple: You sim«
ply blend in with those around you. The better you blend, the less suspi-
cious you become. During the Cold War of the 1950s and ’60s, as is now
notorious, a slew of British civil servants passed secrets to the Soviets. They
went undetected for years because they were apparently decent chaps, had

gone to all the right schools, and lit the oldvboy network perfectly. Blend~
ing in is the perfect smoke screen for spying. The better you do it, the bet-
ter you can conceal your intentions.

    Remember: It takes patience and humility to dull your brilliant colors,
to put on the mask of the inconspicuous. Do not     despair at having to wear
such a bland rnask~—it is often your unreadability that draws people to you
and makes you appear a person of power.

             REVERSAL
             No smoke screen, red herring, false sincerity, or any other diversionary de-
             vice will succeed in concealing your intentions if you already have an es-
             tablished reputation for deception. And as you get older and achieve
             success, it often becomes increasingly difficult to disguise your cunning.
             Everyone knows you practice deception; persist in playing naive and you
             run the risk of seeming the rankest
                                                  hypocrite, which will severely limit
             your room to maneuver. In such cases it is better to own up, to appear the
             honest rogue, or, better, the repentant rogue. Not only will you be admired
             for your frankness, but, most wonderful and strange of all, you will be able
             to continue your stratagems.

                 As P. T. Barnum, the nineteenth-century king of humbuggery, grew
             older, he learned to embrace his reputation as a grand deceiver. At one
             point he organized a buffalo hunt in New jersey, complete with Indians
             and a few imported buffalo. He publicized the hunt as genuine, but it came
             off as so completely fake that the crowd, instead of getting angry and ask-

             ing for their money back, was greatly amused. They knew Barnum pulled
             t:ricks all the time; that was the secret of his success, and they loved him for
             it. Learning a lesson from this affair, Barnum stopped concealing all of his

             devices, even revealing his deceptions in a tell—all autobiography. As
             Kierkegaard wrote, “The world wants to be deceived.”
                 Finally, although it is wiser to divert attention from your purposes by
             presenting a bland, familiar exterior, there are times when the colorful,
             conspicuous gesture is the right diversionary tactic. The great charlatan
             mountebanks of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe used humor
             and entertainment to deceive their audiences. Dazzled by a great show, the

             public would not notice the charlatans’ real intentions. Thus the star charla-
             tan himself would appear in town in a night-black coach drawn by black

             horses. Clowns, tightrope walkers, and star entertainers would accompany
             him, pulling people in to his demonstrations of elixirs and quack potions.
             The charlatan made entertainment seem like the business of the day; the
             business of the day was actually the sale of the elixirs and quack potions.
                  Spectacle and entertainment, clearly, are excellent devices to conceal
             your intentions, but they cannot be used indefinitely. The public grows
             tired and suspicious, and eventually catches on to the trick. And indeed the
             charlatans had to move quickly from town to town, before word spread
             that the potions were useless and the entertainment a trick. Powerful peo-
             ple with bland exteriors, on the other hand—the Talleyrands, the Roth-
             schilds, the Selassies—can practice their deceptions in the same place
             throughout their lifetimes. Their act never wears thin, and rarely causes
             suspicion. The colorful smoke screen should be used cautiously, then, and
             only when the occasion is right.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the court of Louis XIV, nobles and ministers would spend days and
nights debating issues of state. They would confer, argue, make and break
alliances, and argue again, until finally the critical moment arrived: Two of
them would be chosen to represent the different sides to Louis himself,
who would decide what should be done. After these persons were chosen,

                                                                                                    LAW 4                3:3’
                                         everyone would argue some more: How should the issues he phrased?
                                         What would appeal to Louis, what would annoy him? At what fime of day

                                         lnterpretation
                                         Louis XIV was a man of very few words. His most famous remark is
                                         "
                                            ‘fiat, c’est moi” (“I am the state”); nothing could be more pithy yet more
                                         eloquent. His infamous “I shall see” was one of several extremely short
                                         phrases that he would apply to all manner of requests.
                                               Louis was not always this way; as a young man he was known for talk-
                                         ing length, delighting in his own eloquence. His later taciturnity was self-
                                              at

                                         imposed, an act, a mask he used to keep everybody below him off-balance.
                                         No one knew exactly where he stood, or could predict his reactions. No
                                         one could
                                                        try to deceive him by saying what they thought he wanted to
                                         hear,   because    no one knew what he wanted to hear. As
                                                                                                     they talked on and
                                         on to the silent Louis,         revealed        and       about themselves, in-
                                                                    they           more      more

                                         formation he would later use against them to great effect.
                                              In the end, Louis’s silence kept those around him terrified and under
                                         his thumb. It was one of the foundations of his power. As Saint—Simon
                                         wrote, “No one knew as well as he how to sell his words, his smile, even his
                                         glances. Everything in him was valuable because he created differences,
                                         and his majesty was enhanced by the sparseness of his words.”

    Your short answers and silences will put them on the defensive, and
they will jump in, nervously filling the silence with all kinds of comments
that will reveal valuable information about them and their weaknesses.

They will leave a meeting with you feeling as if they had been robbed, and
they will go home and ponder your every word. This extra attention to
your brief comments will only add to your power.
     Saying less than necessary is not for kings and statesmen only. In most
areas of life, the less
                        you say, the more profound and mysterious you ap-
pear. As a young man, the artist Andy Warhol had the revelation that it was
generally impossible to get people to do what you wanted them to do by
talking to them. They would turn against you, subvert your wishes, disobey
you out of sheer perversity. He once told a friend, “I learned that you actu~
ally have more power when you shut up.”
    in his later life Warhol employed this strategy with great success. His
interviews were exercises in oracular speech: He would say something

vague and ambiguous, and the interviewer would twist in circles trying to
figure it out, imagining there was something profound behind his often
meaningless phrases. Warhol rarely talked about his work; he let others do
the interpreting. He claimed to have learned this technique from that mas-
ter of enigma Marcel Duchamp, another twentieth-century artist who real-
ized early on that the less he said about his work, the more people talked
about it. And the more they talked, the more valuable his work became.
    By saying less than necessary you create the appearance of meaning
and power. Also, the less you say, the less risk you run of saying something
foolish, even dangerous. In 1825 a new czar, Nicholas 1, ascended the
throne of Russia. A rebellion immediately broke out, led by liberals de-
manding that the country modemize~—-that its industries and civil struc-
tures catch up with the rest of Europe. Brutally crushing this rebellion (the
Decembrist Uprising), Nicholas I sentenced one of its leaders, Kondraty

Ryleyev, to death. On the day of the execution Ryleyev stood on the
lows, the noose around his neck. The trapdoor opened~——~but as Ryleyev
dangled, the rope broke, dashing him to the ground. At the time, events
like this were considered signs of providence or heavenly will, and a man
saved from execution this way was usually pardoned. As Ryleyev got to his
feet, bruised and dirtied but believing his neck had been saved, he called
out to the crowd, “You see, in Russia they don’t know how to do anything

properly, not even how to make rope!”
       A messenger immediately went to the Winter Palace with news of the
 failed hanging. Vexed by this disappointing turnabout, Nicholas 1 never-
 theless began to sign the pardon. But then: “Did Ryleyev say anything after
 this miracle?” the czar asked the messenger. “Sire,” the messenger replied,
 “he said that in Russia they don’t even know how to make rope.”
       “In that case,” said the Czar, “let us prove the contrary,” and he tore
 up   the pardon. The next day Ryleyev was hanged again. This time the
rope did not break.
    Learn the lesson: Once the words are out, you cannot take them back.
Keep them under control. Be particularly careful with sarcasm: The mo-
                                                                                 LAW 4   .75

             REVERSAL
             There are times when it is unwise to be silent. Silence can arouse suspicion
             and even insecurity, especially in your superiors; a vague or ambiguous
             comment can open you up to interpretations you had not bargained for. Si-

             lence and saying less than necessary must be practiced with caution, then,
             and in the right situations. It is occasionally wiser to imitate the court jester,
             who plays the fool but knows he is smarter than the king. He talks and talks
             and entertains, and no one suspects that he is more than just a fool.
                 Also. words can sometimes act as a kind of smoke screen for any de-
             ception you might practice. By bending your listener’s ear with talk, you
             can distract and mesmerize them; the more you talk, in fact, the less suspi-
             cious of you they become. The verbose are not perceived as sly and ma-

             nipulative but as helpless and unsophisticated. This is the reverse of the
             silent policy employed by the powerful: By talking more, and making
             yourself appear weaker and less intelligent than your mark, you can prac-
             tice deception with greater ease.

                                      Once Bamum did have a reputation of his own, he used the second,
                                  gentler tactic, the fake hypnotism demonstration: He ridiculed his rivals’
                                  reputation. This too was extremely successful. Once you have a solid base
                                  of respect, ridiculing your opponent both puts him on the defensive and

                                  KEYS TO POWER
                                  The people around us, even our closest friends, will always to some extent
                                  remain mysterious and unfathomable. Their characters have secret recesses
                                  that they never reveal. The unknowableness of other people could prove

                                  disturbing if we thought about it long enough, since it would make it im-
                                  possible for us really to judge other people. So we prefer to ignore this fact,
                                  and to judge people on their appearances, on what is most visible to our

                                  eyes—-clothes, gestures, words, actions. In the social realm, appearances are
                                  the barometer of almost all of our judgments, and you must never be nus-
                                  led into believing otherwise. One false slip, one awkward or sudden change
                                  in your appearance, can prove disastrous.

     This is the reason for the supreme importance of making and main-

taining a reputation that is of your own creation.
     That reputation will protect you in the dangerous game of appear-
ances, distracting the probing eyes of others from knowing what you are

really like, and giving you a degree of control over how the world judges
you—a powerful position to be in. Reputation has a power like magic:
With one stroke of its wand, it can double your strength. It can also send

people scurrying away from you. Whether the exact same deeds appear
brilliant or dreadful can depend entirely on the reputation of the deer.
      In the ancient Chinese court of the Wei kingdom there was a man
named Mi Tzu-hsia who had a reputation for supreme civility and gracious-
ness.   He became the mler’s favorite. It was a law in Wei that “whoever
rides secretly in the ruler’s coach shall have his feet cut off,” but when Mi
Tzu-hsia’s mother fell ill, he used the royal coach to visit her, pretending
that the ruler had given him permission. When the ruler found out, he said,
“How dutiful is Mi Tzu-hsia! For his mother’s sake he even forgot that he
was
      committing a crime making him liable to lose his feet!”
      Another time the two of them took a stroll in an orchard. Mi Tzu-hsia
began eating a peach that he could not finish, and he gave the ruler the
other half to eat. The ruler remarked, “You love me so much that you would
even
        forget your own saliva taste and let me eat the rest of the peach!”
     Later, however, envious fellow courtiers, spreading word that Mi Tzu-
hsia was actually devious and arrogant, succeeded in damaging his reputa-
tion; the ruler came to see his actions in a new light “This fellow once rode
in my coach under pretense of my order,” he told the courtiers angrily,
“and another time he gave me a half-eaten peach.” For the same actions
that had charmed the ruler when he was the favorite, Mi Tzu-hsia now had
to suffer the   penalties. The fate of his feet depended solely on the strength
of his reputation.
      In the beginning, you must work to establish a reputation for one out-
standing quality, whether generosity or honesty or cunning. This quality
sets you apart and gets other people to talk about you. You then make your

reputation known to as many people as possible (subtly, though; take care
to build slowly, and with a firm foundation), and watch as it spreads like
wildfire.
      A solid reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your
strengths without your having to spend much energy. It can also create an
aura around you that will instill respect, even fear. In the fighting in the
North African desert during World War II, the German general Erwin
Rommel had a reputation for cunning and for deceptive maneuvering that
struck terror into everyone who faced him. Even when his forces were de-
pleted, and when British tanks outnumbered his by five to one, entire cities
would be evacuated at the news of his approach.
     As they say, your reputation inevitably precedes you, and if it inspires

respect, a lot of your work is done for you before you arrive on the scene,
or utter a   single word.
       Your success seems destined by your past triumphs. Much of the suc-

                                                                                  LAW 5   41
             cess   of Henry Kissinger‘s shuttle diplomacy rested on his reputation for
             ironing out differences; no one wanted to be seen as so unreasonable that
             Kissinger could not sway him. A peace treaty seemed a fait accompli as
             soon as
                       Kissinger’s name became involved in the negotiations.
                    Make your reputation simple and base it on one sterling quality. This

             single quality—-efiiciency, say, or seductiveness-—becomes a kind of calling
             card that announces your presence and places others under a spell. A repu-
             tation for honesty will allow you to practice all manner of deception.
             Casanova used his reputation as a great seducer to pave the way for his fu-
             ture conquests; women who had heard of his powers became
                                                                                 immensely
             curious, and wanted to discover for themselves what had made him so ro-
             mantically successful.
                  Perhaps you have already stained your reputation, so that you are pre-
             vented from establishing a new one. In such cases it is wise to associate
             with someone whose image counteracts your own, using their good name
             to whitewash and elevate yours. It is hard, for example, to erase a reputa-

             tion for dishonesty by yourself; but a paragon of honesty can help. ‘Nixon
             P. T. Barnum wanted to clean up a reputation for promoting vulgar enter-

             tainment, he brought the singer jenny Lind over from Europe. She had a
             stellar, high—class reputation, and the American tour Bamum sponsored for
             her greatly enhanced his own image. Similarly the great robber barons of
             nineteentlrcentury America were long unable to rid themselves of a repu-
             tation for cruelty and mean-spiritedness. Only when they began collecting
             art, so that the names of Morgan and Frick became permanently associated
             with those of da Vinci and Rembrandt, were they able to soften their un-

             pleasant image.
                  Reputation is a treasure to be carefully collected and hoarded. Espe-
             cially when you are first establishing it, you must protect it strictly, antici-
             pating all attacks on it. Once it is solid, do not let yourself get angry or
             defensive at the slanderous comments of your enemies—that reveals inse-
             curity, not confidence in your reputation. Take the high road instead, and
             never
                     appear desperate in your self—defense. On the other hand, an attack
             on another man’s
                                  reputation is a potent weapon, particularly when you
             have less power than he does. He has much more to lose in such a battle,
             and your own thus~far-small reputation gives him a. small target when he
             tries to return your fire. Bamum used such campaigns to geat effect in his

             early career. But this tactic must be practiced with skill; you must not seem
             to engage in petty vengeance. If you do not break your enemy’s reputation

             cleverly, you will inadvertently ruin your own.
                    Thomas Edison, considered the inventor who harnessed electricity,
             believed that a workable system would have to be based on direct cur-
             rent   (DC). When the Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla appeared to have suc-
             ceeded in creating a system based on alternating current (AC), Edison was
             furious. He determined to ruin Tesla’s reputation, by making the public be-
             lieve that the AC system was inherently unsafe, and Tesla irresponsible in
             promoting it.
                    To this end he captured all kinds of household pets and electrocuted

them to death with an AC current. When this wasn’t enough, in 1890 he got
New York State prison authorities to organize the world’s first execution by
electrocution, using an AC current. But Edison’s electrocution experiments
had all been with small creatures; the charge was too weak, and the man
was
     only half killed. In perhaps the country’s cruelest state-authorized exe
cufion, the procedure had to be repeated. It was an awful spectacle.
     Although, in the long run, it is Edison’s name that has survived, at the
time his   campaign damaged his own reputation more than Tesla’s. He
backed off. The lesson is simple-—never go too far in attacks like these, for
that will draw more attention to your own vengefulness than to the person
you are slandering. When your own reputation is solid, use subtler tactics,
such as satire and ridicule, to weaken your opponent while making you out
as a
    charming rogue. The mighty lion toys with the mouse that crosses his
path—any other reaction would mar his fearsome reputation.

Authority: Therefore I should wish our courtier to bolster up his inherent
worth with skill and cunning, and ensure that whenever he has to go where
he is a stranger, he is preceded by a good reputation.       4   .   .   For the lame
which appears to rest on the opinions of many fosters a certain unshak-
able belief in a man’s worth which is then easily strengthened in minds
already thus disposed and prepared. {Baldassare Castiglione, 1478— 1529)


REVERSAL
There is no possible Reversal. Reputation is critical; there are no excep-
tions to this law. Perhaps, not caring what others think of you, you gain a

reputation for insolence and arrogance, but that can be a valuable image in
itself—0scar Wilde used it to great advantage. Since we must live in soci-
ety and must depend on the opinions of others, there is nothing to be
gained by neglecting your reputation. By not caring how you are per»
ceived, you let others decide this for you. Be the master of your fate, and
also of your reputation.

KEYS TO POWER

Burning more brightly than those around you is a skill that no one is born
with. You have to learn to attract attention, “as surely as the lodestone at~
tracts iron.” At the start of
                                     your career, you must attach your name and rep-
utation to a quality, an image, that sets you apart from other people. This

image can be something like a characteristic style of dress, or a personality
quirk that amuses people and gets talked about. Once the image is estalr
lished, you have an appearance, a place in the sky for your star.
     It is a common mistake to imagine that this peculiar appearance of
yours should not be controversial, that to be attacked is somehow bad.
Nothing could be further from the truth. To avoid being a flash in the pan,
and having your notoriety eclipsed by another, you must not discriminate
between different types of attention; in the end, every kind will work in
your favor. Barnum, we have seen, welcomed personal attacks and felt
no need    to defend himself. He deliberately courted the image of being a

humbug.

                                                                                                    LAW6            .1   47
              The court of Louis XIV contained many talented writers, artists, great
        beauties, and men and women of impeccable virtue, but no one was more
        talked about than the singular Due de Lauzun. The duke was short, almost
        dwarfish, and he was prone to the most insolent kinds of behavior-—he
        slept with the king’s mistress, and openly insulted not only other courtiers
        but the king himself. Louis, however, was so beguiled by the duke’s eccen~
        tricities that he could not beat his absences from the court. It was simple:
        The strangeness of the duke’s character attracted attention. Once people
        were enthralled
                       by him, they wanted him around at any cost.

        general mediocrity. Never  be afraid, then, of the qualities that set you apart
        and draw attention to you. Court controversy, even scandal. It is better to
        be attacked, even slandered, than ignored. All professions are ruled by this
        law, and all professionals must have a bit of the showman about them.
           The great scientist Thomas Edison knew that to raise money he had to
        remain in the public eye at any cost. Almost as important as the inventions
        themselves was how he presented them to the public and courted attention.
              Edison would design w'sual1y dazzling experiments to display his dis~
        coveries with electricity. He would talk of future inventions that seemed
        fantastic   at   the   time-—robots, and machines that could photograph
        thought—-and that he had no intention of wasting his energy on, but that
        made the public talk about him. He did everything he could to make sure
        that he received more attention than his great rival Nikola Tesla, who may

        actually have been more brilliant than he was but whose name was far less
        known. In 1915, it was rumored that Edison and Tesla would be joint recip-
        ients of that year’s Nobel Prize in physics. The prize was eventually given to
        a
            pair of English physicists; only later was it discovered that the prize com-
        mittee had actually approached Edison, but he had turned them down, re-v

        fusing to share the prize with Tesla. By that time his fame was more secure
        than Tesla’s, and he thought it better to refuse the honor than to allow his
        rival the attention that would have come even from sharing the prize.
             If you find yourself in a lowly position that offers little opportunity for
        you to draw attention, an effective trick is to attack the most visible, most
        famous, most powerful person you can find. When Pietro Aretino, a young
        Roman servant boy of the early sixteenth century, wanted to get attention
        as a writer of verses, he decided to
                                             publish a series of satirical poems rid}
        culing the pope and his affection for a
                                                pet elephant. The attack put Aretino
        in the public eye immediately. A slanderous attack on a person in a posi-
        tion of power would have a similar effect. Remember, however, to use such
        tactics sparingly after you have the public’s attention, when the act can
        wear thin.

              Once in the limelight you must constantly renew it by adapting and
        varying your method of courting attention. If you don’t, the public will
        grow tired, will take you for granted, and will move on to a newer star. The
        game requires constant vigilance and creativity. Pablo Picasso never al
        lowed himself to fade into the background; if his name became too at


LAW 6
tached to a particular style, he would deliberately upset the public with a
new   series of paintings that went against all expectations. Better to create

something ugly and disturbing, he believed, than to let viewers grow too fa-
miliar with his work. Understand: People feel superior to the person whose
actions they can predict. If you show them who is in control by playing

against their expectations, you both gain their respect and lighten your hold
on dreir
          fleeting attention.

        OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
         Beginning in 1905, rumors started to spread throughout Paris of a young
         Oriental girl who danced in a private home, wrapped in veils that she grad-
         ually discarded. A local journalist who had seen her dancing reported that
         “a woman from the Far East had come to Europe laden with perfume and

        jewels, to introduce some of the richness of the Oriental colour and iife into
         the satiated society of European cities.” Soon everyone knew the dam:er’s
        name:      Mata Han‘.

                 Early that year, in the winter, small and select audiences would gather
        in   a   salon filled with Indian statues and other relics while an orchestra
        played music inspired by Hindu and Javanese melodies. After keeping the
         audience waiting and wondering, Mata Hari would suddenly appear, in a
         startling costume: a white cotton brassiere covered with India.n~type jewels;
        jeweled bands at the waist supporting a sarong that revealed as much as it
         concealed; bracelets up the arms. Then Mata Hari would dance, in a style
        no one in France had seen before, her whole body swaying as if she were in

        a trance.     She told her excited and curious audience that her dances told
        stories from Indian mythology and javanese folktales. Soon the cream of

        Paris, and ambassadors from far—off lands, were competing for invitations
        to the salon, where it was rumored that Mata. Hari was actually performing

        sacred dances in the nude.
                 The public wanted to know more about her. She told journalists that
        she was actually Dutch in origin, but had grown up on the island of java.
        She would also talk about time spent in India, how she had learned sacred
        Hindu dances there, and how Indian women “can shoot straight, ride
        horseback, and are capable of doing logarithms and talk philosophy.” By
        the summer of 1905, although few Parisians had actually seen Mata Hari
        dance, her name was on everyone’s lips.
            As Mata Hari gave more interviews, the story of her origins kept
        changing: She had grown up in India, her grandmother was the daughter
        of ajavanese princess, she had lived on the island of Sumatra where she
        had spent her time “horsebaxzk riding, gun in hand, and risking her life.”
        No one knew                 certain about her, but journalists did not mind these

        changes in her biography. They compared her to an Indian goddess, a
        creature from the pages of Baudelaire—whatever their        imagination wanted
        to see in this mysterious woman from the East.
                 In August of 1905, Mata Hari performed for the first time in public.



LAW 6
Crowds thronging to see her on opening night caused a riot. She had now
become a cult
               figure, spawning many imitations. One reviewer wrote,
“Mata Hari personifies all the poetry of India, its mysticism, its voluptuous-
ness, its hypnotizing charm.” Another noted, “If India possesses such unex-

pected treasures, then all Frenchmen will emigrate to the shores of the
Ganges.”
     Soon the fame of Mata Hari and her sacred Indian dances spread be-
yond Paris. She was invited to Berlin, Vienna, Milan. Over the next few
years she performed throughout Europe, mixed with the highest social cir-
cles, and earned an income that gave her an independence rarely enjoyed
by a woman of the period. Then, near the end of World War I, she was ar-
rested in France, tried, convicted, and finally executed as a German spy.
Only during the trial did the truth come out: Mata Hari was not from java
or India, had not
                  grown up in the Orient, did not have a drop of Eastern
blood in her body. Her real name was Margaretha Zelle, and she came
from the stolid northern province of Friesland, Holland.


Interpretation
When Margaretha Zelle arrived in Paris, in 1904, she had half a franc in
her pocket. She was one of the thousands of beautiful young girls who
flocked to Paris every year, taking work as artists’ models, nightclub
dancers, or vaudeville performers at the Folies Bergére. After a few years
they would inevitably be replaced by younger girls, and would often end
up on the streets, turning to prostitution, or else returning to the town they
came    from, older and chastened.
    Zelle had higher ambitions. She had no dance experience and had
never
      performed in the theater, but as a young girl she had traveled with
her family and had witnessed local dances in Java and Sumatra. Zelle
clearly understood that what was important in her act was not the dance it-
self, or even her face or figure, but her ability to create an air of mystery
about herself. The mystery she created lay not just in her dancing, or her
costumes, or the stories she would tell, or her endless lies about her origins;
it lay in an atmosphere enveloping everything she did. There was nothing

you could say for sure about her——she was always changing, always sur-
prising her audience with new costumes, new dances, new stories. This air
of mystery left the public always wanting to know more, always wondering
about her next move. Mata Hari was no more beautiful than many of the
other young girls who came to Paris, and she was not a particularly good
dancer. What separated her from the mass, what attracted and held the
public’s attention and made her famous and wealthy, was her mystery.
People are enthralled by mystery; because it invites constant interpreta-
tion, they never tire of it. The mysterious cannot be grasped. And what
cannot be seized and consumed creates power.




                                                                                  LAW 6   f51
             KEYS TO POWER
             In the past, the world was filled with the terrifying and unknowable—
             diseases, disasters, capricious despots, the mystery of death itself. What we
             could not understand we reimagined as myths and spirits. Over the cen-
             turies, though, we have managed, through science and reason, to illumi-
             nate the darkness; what was mysterious and       forbidding has grown familiar
             and comfortable. Yet this light has     a
                                                         price: in a world that is ever more
             banal, that has had its mystery and myth squeezed out of it, we secretly
             crave
                    enigmas, people or things that cannot be instantly interpreted,
             seized, and consumed.
                  That is the power of the mysterious: It invites layers of interpretation,
             excites our imagination, seduces us into believing that it conceals some-

             thing marvelous. The world has become so familiar and its inhabitants so
             predictable that what wraps itself in mystery will almost always draw the
             limelight to it and make us watch it.
                 Do not imagine that to create an air of mystery you have to be grand
             and awe~inspirlng. Mystery that is woven into your day-to-day demeanor,
             and is subtle, has that much more power to fascinate and attract attention.
             Remember: Most people are upfront, can be read like an open book, take
             little care to control their words or image, and are hopelessly predictable.

             By simply holding back, keeping silent, occasionally uttering arnbiguous
             phrases, deliberately appearing inconsistent, and acting odd in tlie subtlest
             of ways, you will emanate an aura of mystery. The people around you will
             then magnify that aura by constantly dying to interpret you.
                 Both artists and con artists understand the vital link between being
             mysterious and attracting interest. Count Victor Lustig, the aristocrat of
             swindlers, played the game to perfection. He was always doing things that
             were  different, or seemed to make no sense. He would show up at the best
             hotels in a limo driven by ajapanese chauffeur; no one had ever seen a
             Japanese chauffeur before, so this seemed exotic and strange. Lustig would
             dress in the most expensive clothing, but always with something—a medal,
             a flower, an arrnband—out of place, at least in conventional terms. This
             was seen  not as tasteless but as odd and intriguing. In hotels he would be

             seen
                  receiving telegrams at all hours, one afier the other, brought to him by
             his Japanese chauffeur—telegrams he would tear up with utter noncha-
             lance. (In fact they were fakes, completely blank.) He would sit alone in the
             dining room, reading a large and impressive-looking book, smiling at peo-
             ple yet remaining aloof. Vlfithin a few days, of course, the entire hotel
             would be abuzz with interest in this strange man.
                 All this attention allowed Lustig to lure suckers in with ease. They
             would beg for his confidence and his company. Everyone wanted to be
             seen    with this mysterious aristocrat. And in the presence of this distracting
             enigma, they wouldn’t even notice that they were being robbed blind.
                 An air of mystery can make the mediocre appear intelligent and pro-
             found. It made Mata Hari, a woman of average appearance and intelli-
             gence, seem like a goddess, and her dancing divinely inspired. An air of


52   LAW 6
mystery about an artist makes his or her artwork immediately more intrigu-
ing, a trick Marcel Duchamp played to great effect. It is all very easy to
clo—-say little about your work, tease and titillate with alluring, even contra~
dictory comments, then stand back and let others try to make sense of it all.
     Mysterious people put others in a kind of inferior position—-that of try-
ing figure them out. To degrees that they can control, they also elicit the
    to
fear surrounding anything uncertain or unknown. All great leaders know
that an aura of mystery draws attention to them and creates an intimidating
presence. Mao Tse-rung, for example, cleverly cultivated an enigmatic
image; he had no worries about seeming inconsistent or contradicting him~
self-—fl1e very contradictoriness of his actions and words meant that he a.l~
ways had the upper hand. No one, not even his own wife, ever felt they
understood him, and he therefore seemed larger than life. This also meant
that the public paid constant attention to him, ever anxious to witness his
next move.
     If your social position prevents you from completely wrapping your
actions in mystery, you must at least learn to make yourself less obvious.

Every now and then, act in a way that does not mesh with other people’s
perception of you. This way you keep those around you on the defensive,
eliciting the kind of attention that makes you powerful. Done right, the ore
ation of enigma. can also draw the kind of attention that strikes terror into

your enemy.
     During the Second Punic War (219402 13.0.), the great Carthaginian
general Hannibal was wreaking havoc in his march on Rome. Hannibal
was known for his cleverness and
                                   duplicity.
     Under his leadership Carthage’s army, though smaller than those of
the Romans, had constantly outmaneuvered them. On one occasion,
though, Hann1‘bal’s scouts made a horrible blunder, leading his troops into
a
   marshy terrain with the sea at their back. The Roman army blocked the
mountain passes that led inland, and its general, Fabius, was ecstatic-at
last he had Hannibal trapped. Posting his best sentries on the passes, he
worked on a plan to destroy Hannibal’s forces. But in the middle of the
night, the sentries looked down to see a mysterious sight: A huge proces-
sion of lights was heading up the mountain. Thousands and thousands of

lights. If this was Hannibal’s army, it had suddenly grown a hundredfold.
     The sentries argued heatedly about what this could mean: Reinforce-

explanation made sense.
     As they watched, fires broke out all over the mountain, and a horrible
noise drified up to them from below, like the blowing of a million horns.
Demons, they thought. The sentries, the bravest and most sensible in the
 Roman army, fled their posts in a panic.

     By the next day, Hannibal had escaped from the marshland. What was
his trick? Had he really conjured up demons? Actually what he had done
was order bundles of
                       twigs to be fastened to the horns of the thousands of
oxen that traveled with his
                            troops as beasts of burden. The twigs were then


                                                                                   LAW6   3   53
               lit, giving the impression of the torches of a vast army heading up the
               mountain. When the flames burned down to the oxen’s skin, they stam-

               peded in all directions, bellowing like mad and setting fires all over the
               mountainside. The key to this device’s success was not the torches, the
               fires, or the noises in themselves, however, but the fact that Hannibal had
               created a puzzle that captivated the sentries’ attention and gradually terri-
               fied them. From the mountaintop there was no way to explain this bizarre
               sight. If the sentries could have explained it they would have stayed at their
               posts.
                   If you find yourself trapped, cornered, and on the defensive in some
               situation, try a simple experiment: Do something that cannot be easily ex-
               plained or interpreted. Choose a simple action, but carry it out in a way
               that unsettles your opponent, a way with many possible interpretations,
               making your intentions obscure. Don’t just be unpredictable (although this
               tactic too can be successful—see Law 17); like Hannibal, create a scene that
               cannot be read. There will seem to be no method to your madness, no

               rhyme or reason, no single explanation. If you do this right, you will in-
               spire fear and trembling and the sentries will abandon their posts. Call it
               the “feigned madness of Hamlet” tactic, for Hamlet uses it to great effect in
               Shakespeare‘s play, frightening his stepfather Claudius through the mys-
               tery of his behavior. The mysterious makes your forces seem larger, your
               power more terrifying.

R EV F. RSAL
In the beginning of your rise to the top, you must attract attention at all
cost, but as you rise higher you must constantly adapt. Never wear the pub-
lic out with the same tactic. An air of mystery works wonders for those who
need to develop an aura of power and get themselves noticed, but it must
seem measured and under control.     Mata Hari went too far with her fabri-
cations; although the accusation that she was a spy was false, at the time it
was a reasonable
                   presumption because all her lies made her seem suspi-
cious and nefarious. Do not let your air of mystery be slowly transformed
into a reputation for deceit. The mystery you create must seem a game,

playful and unthreatening. Recognize when it goes too far, and pull back.
    There are times when the need for attention must be deferred, and
when scandal and notoriety are the last things you want to create. The at-
tention you attract must never offend or challenge the reputation of those
above you—not, at any rate, if they are secure. You will seem not only pal-
try but desperate by comparison. There is an art to knowing when to draw
notice and when to withdraw.
    Lola Montez was one of the great practitioners of the art of attracting
attention. She managed to rise from a middle—class Irish background to

being the lover of Franz Liszt and then the mistress and political adviser of
King Ludwig of Bavaria. In her later years, though, she lost her sense of
proportion.
    In London in 1850 there was to be a performance of Shakespeare’s
Macbeth featuring the greatest actor of the time, Charles john Kean. Every-
one of
        consequence in English society was to be there; it was rumored that
even   Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were to make a public appearance.
The custom of the period demanded that everyone be seated before the

queen anived. So the audience got there a little early, and when the queen
entered her royal box, they observed the convention of standing up and
applauding her. The royal couple waited, then bowed. Everyone sat down
and the lights were dimmed. Then, suddenly, all eyes turned to a box op-

posite Queen Victoria’s: A woman appeared from the shadows, taking her
seat later than the queen. It was Lola Montez. She wore a diamond tiara on
her dark hair and a long fur coat over her shoulders. People whispered in
amazement as the ermine cloak was     dropped to reveal a low-necked gown
of crimson velvet. By turning their heads, the audience could see that the
royal couple deliberately avoided looking at Lola’s box. They followed
Victoria’s example, and for the rest of the evening Lola Montez was ig-
nored. After that evening no one in fashionable society dared to be seen
with her. All her magnetic powers were reversed. People would flee her
sight. Her future in England was finished.
     Never appear overly greedy for attention, then, for it signals insecurity,
and insecurity drives power away. Understand that there are times when it
is not in your interest to be the center of attention. When in the presence of
a
  king or queen, for instance, or the equivalent thereof, bow and retreat to
the shadows; never compete.

                                                                                          I

covered the location of the Incan empire, a soldier in his own army, Fran-
cisco Pizarro, helped to get him beheaded for treason. Pizarro went on to
take what Balboa had spent so many years trying to find.
      The other pole is that of the artist Peter Paul Rubens, who, late in his
career, found himself   deluged with requests for paintings. He created a sys-
tem: In his   large studio he employed dozens of outstanding painters, one

specializing in robes, another in backgrounds, and so on. He created a vast
production line in which a large number of canvases would be worked on
at the   same   time. When an important client visited the studio, Rubens
would shoo his hired painters out for the day. While the client watched
from a balcony, Rubens would work at an incredible pace, with unbeliev-
able energy. The client would leave in awe of this prodigious man, who
could paint so many masterpieces in so short a time.
      This is the essence of the Law: Loam to get others to do the work for

you while you take the credit, and you appear to be of godlike strength and
power. If you think it important to do all the work yourself, you will never
get far, and you will suffer the fate of the Balboas and Teslas of the world.
Find people with the skills and creativity you lack. Either hire them, while

putting your own name on top of theirs, or find a way to take their work
and make it your own. Their creativity thus becomes yours, and you seem
a
    genius to the world.

sitic use of your contemporaries’ labor: Use the past, a vast storehouse of

              ders of giants.” He meant that in making his discoveries he had built on the
              achievements of others. A great part of his aura of genius, he knew, was at-
              tributable to his shrewd ability to make the most of the insights of ancient,
              medieval, and Renaissance scientists. Shakespeare borrowed plots, charac-
              terizations, and even dialogue from Plutarch, among other writers, for he
              knew that nobody surpassed Plutarch in the writing of subtle psychology
              and witty quotes. How many later writers have in their turn borrowed
              from-~plagz'anlzed——Shakespeare?
                  We all know how few of today’s politicians write their own speeches.
              Their own words would not win them a single vote; their eloquence and
              wit, whatever there is of it, they owe to a speech writer. Other people
              do the work, they take the credit. The upside of this is that it is a. kind
              of power that is available to everyone. Learn to use the knowledge of the

There are times when taking the credit for work that others have done is
not the wise course: If your power is notfirmly enough established, you
will seem to be pushing people out of the limelight. To be a. brilliant ex-
ploiter of talent your position must be unshakable, or you will be accused
of deception.
     Be sure you know when letting other people share the credit serves
your purpose. It is especially important to not be greedy when you have a
master above you. President Richard Nixon’s historic visit to the People’s

Republic of China was originally his idea, but it might never have come off
but for the deft diploma/cy of Henry Kissinger. Nor would it have been as
successful without Kissinger’s skills. Stilh when the time came to take
credit, Kissinger adroitly let Nixon take the lion’s share. Knowing that the
truth would come out later, he was careful not to jeopardize his standing in
the short term by hogging the limelight. Kissinger played the game ex~
partly: He took credit for the work of those below him while graciously
giving credit for his own labors to those above. That is the way to play
the game.

OBSERVANCl:‘ OF THE LAW
At the Congress of Vienna in 1814, the major powers of Europe gathered to
carve up the remains of   Napoleon’s fallen Empire. The city was full of gai-
ety and the balls were the most splendid in memory. Hovering over the
proceedings, however, was the shadow of Napoleon himself. Instead of
being executed or exiled far away, he had been sent to the island of Elba,
not far from the coast of Italy.
     Even imprisoned on an island, a man as bold and creative as

Napoleon Bonaparte made everyone nervous. The Austrians plotted to kill
him on Elba, but decided it was too risky. Alexander I, Rnssia’s tempera»
mental czar, heightened the anxiety by throwing a {it during the congress
when a part of Poland was denied him: “Beware, I shall loose the mon-
ster!" he threatened. Everyone knew he meant Napoleon. Of all the states
men     gathered in Vienna, only Talleyrand, Napoleon’s former foreign
minister, seemed calm and unconcerned. It was as if he knew something
the others did not.
    Meanwhile, on the island of Elba, Napoleon's life was a mockery of his
previous glory. As Elba’s “king,” he had been allowed to form a court-—
there was a cook, a wardrobe mistress, an official pianist, and a. handful of
courtiers. All this was designed to humiliate Napoleon, and it seemed to
work.
     That winter, however, there occurred a. series of events so strange and
dramatic they might have been scripted in a play. Elba was surrounded by
British ships, their cannons covering all possible exit points. Yet somehow,
in broad daylight on 26 February 1815, a ship with nine hundred men on
board picked up Napoleon and put to sea The English gave chase but the
ship got away. This almost impossible escape astonished the public
throughout Europe, and terrified the statesmen at the Congress of Vienna.
     Although it would have been safer to leave Europe, Napoleon not only
chose to return to France, he raised the odds by marching on Paris with a
tiny army, in hopes of recapturing the throne. His strategy worked——people
of all classes threw themselves at his feet. An army under Marshal Ney sped
from Paris to arrest him, but when the soldiers saw their beloved former
leader, they changed sides. Napoleon was declared emperor again. Volun-
teers swelled the ranks of his new army. Delirium swept the country. In Paris,
crowds went wild. The king who had replaced Napoleon fled the country.
    For the next hundred days, Napoleon ruled France. Soon, however, the
giddiness subsided. France was bankrupt, its resources nearly exhausted,
and there was little Napoleon could do about this. At the Battle of Waterloo,
injune of that year, he was finally defeated for good. This time his enemies
 had learned their lesson: They exiled him to the barren island of Saint I-Ie~
 lena, off the west coast of Africa. There he had no more hope of escape.

 Interpretation
 Only years later did the facts of Napoleon's dramatic escape from Elba
 come to   light. Before he decided to attempt this bold move, visitors to his
 court had told him that he was more popular in France than ever, and that

                                                                                 LAW 8   63
            the country would embrace him again. One of these visitors was Austria’s
            General Keller, who convinced Napoleon that if he escaped, the European
            powers, England included, would welcome him back into power. Napoleon
            was
                tipped off that the English would let him go, and indeed his escape oc-
            curred in the middle of the afternoon, in full view of English spyglasses.
                What Napoleon did not know was that there was a man behind it all,
            pulling the strings, and that this man was his former minister, Talleyrand.
            And Talleyrand was doing all this not to bring back the glory days but to
            crush Napoleon once and for all. Considering the emperor’s ambition un-
            settling to Europe’s stability, he had turned against him long ago. When
            Napoleon was exiled to Elba, Talleyrand had protested. Napoleon should
            be sent farther away, he argued, or Europe would never have peace. But
            no one   Listened.
                Instead of pushing his opinion, Talleyrand bided his time. Working
            quietly, he eventually won over Castlereagh and Metternich, the foreign
            ministers of England and Austria.

                Together these men baited Napoleon into escaping. Even Koller’s visit,
            to whisper the promise of glory in the exile’s ear, was part of the plan. Like
            a master
                      cardplayer, Talleyrand figured everything out in advance. He
            knew Napoleon would fall into the trap he had set He also foresaw that
            Napoleon would lead the country into a war, which, given France’s wea.k~
            ened condition, could only last a few months. One diplomat in Vienna,
            who understood that Talleyrand was behind it all, said, “He has set the
            house ablaze in order to save it from the plague.”

            KEYS TO POWER
            How many times has this scenario played itself out in history: An aggres~
            sive leader initiates a series of bold moves that begin by bringing him
            much power. Slowly, however, his power reaches a peak, and soon every-
            thing turns against him. His numerous enemies band together; trying to
            maintain his power, he exhausts himself going in this direction and that,
            and inevitably he collapses. The reason for this pattern is that the aggres-
            sive person is rarely in full control. He cannot see more than a couple of
            moves    ahead, cannot see the consequences of this bold move or that one.
            Because he is constantly being forced to react to the moves of his ever-

            growing host of enemies, and to the unforeseen consequences of his own
            rash actions, his aggressive energy is turned against him.
                In the realm of power, you must ask yourself, what is the point of chas-

            ing here  and there, trying to solve problems and defeat my enemies, if I
            never feel in control?
                                   Why am I always having to react to events instead of
            directing them?   The  answer is
                                             simple: Your idea of power is wrong. You
M   LAW 8
have mistaken aggressive action for effective action. And most often the
most effective action is to stay back, keep calm, and let others be frustrated

by the trips you lay for them, playing for long-term power rather than
quick victory.
    Remember: The essence of power is the ability to keep the initiative,
                                       keep your opponent and those
to get others to react to your moves, to
around you on the defensive. When you make other people come to you,
you suddenly become the one controlling the situation. And the one who
has control has power. Two things must happen to place you in this posi-
tion: You yourself must learn to master your emotions, and never to be in-
fluenced by anger; meanwhile, however, you must play on people’s natural
tendency to react angrily when pushed and baited. In the long run, the
ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any
tool of aggression.
    Study how Talleyrand, the master of the art, performed this delicate
trick. First, he overcame the urge to try to convince his fellow statesmen
that they needed to banish Napoleon far away. It is only natural to want to
persuade people by pleading your case, imposing your will with words. But
this often turns against you. Few of Talleyrand’s contemporaries believed
Napoleon was still a threat, so that if he had spent a lot of energy trying to
convince them, he would only have made himself look foolish. Instead, he
held his tongue and his emotions in check. Most important of all, he laid
Napoleon a sweet and irresistible trap. He knew the man’s weakness, his
impetuosity, his need for glory and the love of the masses, and he played
all this to perfection. When Napoleon went for the bait, there was no dan-
ger that he might succeed and turn the tables on Talleyrand, who better
than anyone knew France’s depleted state. And even had Napoleon been
able to overcome these difficulties, the likelihood of his success would have
been greater were he able to choose his time and place of action. By setting
the proper trap, Talleyrand took the time and place into his own hands.
    All of us have only so much energy, and there is a moment when our
energies are at their peak. ‘When you make the other person come to you,
he wears himself out, wasting his energy on the trip. In the year 1905, Rus-
sia ancl japan were at war. The Japanese had only recently begun to mod
emize their warships, so that the Russians had a stronger navy, but by

spreading false information the Japanese marshal Togo Heihachiro baited
the Russians into leaving their docks in the Baltic Sea, making them believe
they could wipe out the Japanese fleet in one swift attack. The Russian fleet
could not reachjapan by the quickest route——through the Strait of Gibral—
tar and then the Suez   Canal into the Indian Ocean"-because these were
controlled by the British, and japan was an ally of Great Britain. They had
to go around the    Cape of Good Hope, at the southern tip of Africa, adding
over more than six thousand miles to the voyage. Once the fleet     passed the
Cape,  the Japanese spread   another  false story: They were sailing to launch
a counterattack. So the Russians made the entire
                                                    journey japan on conr

bat alert. By the time they arrived, their seamen were tense, exhausted, and
overworked, while the Japanese had been waiting at their ease. Despite the
                                                                                 LAW 8   65
             odds and their lack of experience in modem naval warfare, the Japanese
             crushed the Russians.
                  One added benefit of making the opponent come to you, as the _]a.pa—
             nese discovered with the        Russians, is that it forces him to operate in your
             territory. Being   on hostile   ground will make him nervous and often he will
             rush his actions and make mistakes. For negotiations or meetings, it is al-
             ways wise to lure others into your territory, or the territory of your choice.
             You have your bearings, while they see nothing familiar and are subtly
             placed on the defensive.
                 Manipulation is a dangerous game. Once someone suspects he is
             being manipulated, it becomes harder and harder to control him. But
             when you make your opponent come to you, you create the illusion that he
             is controlling the situation. He does not feel the strings that pull hirmjust as

             Napoleon imagined that he himself was the master of his daring escape and
             return to power.

                  Everything depends on the sweetness of your bait. If your trap is at»

                  The great nineteenth-century robber baron Daniel Drew was a master
             at playing the stock market. When he wanted a particular stock to be
             bought or sold, driving prices up or down, he rarely resorted to the direct
             approach. One of his tricks was to hurry through an exclusive club near
             Wall Street, obviously on his way to the stock exchange, and to pull out his

             customary red bandanna to wipe his perspiring brow. A slip of paper
             would fall from this bandanna that he would pretend not to notice. The
             club’s members were always trying to foresee Drew’s moves, and they
             would pounce on the paper, which invariably seemed to contain an inside

             up on a stock. Word would spread, and members would buy or sell the
             stock in droves, playing perfectly into Drew’s hands.
                  If you can get other people to dig their own graves, why sweat your-
             self? Pickpockets work this to perfection. The key to picking a pocket is
             knowing which pocket contains the wallet. Experienced pickpockets often
             ply their trade in train stations and other places where there is a. clearly
             marked sign reading BEWARE OF PICKPOCKE’l‘S. Passersby seeing the sign in-
             variably feel for their wallet to make sure it is still there. For the watching
             pickpockets, this is like shooting fish in a barrel. Pickpockets have even
             been known to place their own BEWARE OF PICKPOCKETS signs to ensure
             their success.
                 V/Vhen you are making people come to you, it is sometimes better to let
             them know you are forcing their hand. You give up deception for overt ma-
             nipulation. The psychological ramifications are profound: The person who
             makes others come to him appears powerful, and demands respect.
                 Filippo Brunelleschi, the great Renaissance artist and architect, was a
             great practitioner of the art of making others come to him as a sign of his
             power. On one occasion he had been engaged to repair the dome of the
             Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral in Florence. The commission was impor-

66   LAW 8
lam and     prestigious. But when the city officials hired a second man,
Lorenzo Ghibem‘, to work with B1-unelleschi, the great artist brooded in se~
cret. He knew that Ghiberti had gotten the job through his connections,
and that he would do none of the work and get half the credit. At a critical
moment of the construction, then, Brunelleschi suddenly developed a mys-
terious illness. He had to stop work, but pointed out to city officials that

they had hired Ghiberti, who should have been able to continue the work
on his own. Soon it became clear that Ghiberti was useless and the ofiicials

came   begging to Brunelleschi. He ignored them, insisting that Ghiberti
should finish the project, until finally they realized the problem: They fired
Ghiberti.
    By some miracle, Bnmelleschi recovered within days. He did not have
to throw a tantrum or make a fool of himself; he simply practiced the art of

“making others come to you.”
    If on one occasion you make it a point of dignity that others must
come to you and you        succeed, they will continue to do so even after you
stop trying.

                is the principle of emptiness and fullness
                of others and self. When you induce oppo-
                nents to     come    to    you, then their force is
                 always  empty; as long as you do not
                go to them. your force is always full. Attack
                 ing emptiness with fullness is like throwing

             REVERSAL

             Although it is generally the wiser policy to make others exhaust themselves
             chasing you, there are opposite cases where strildng suddenly and aggres-
             sively at the enemy so demoralizes him that his energies sink. Instead of
             making others come to you, you go to them, force the issue, take the lead.
             Fast attack can be an awesome weapon, for it forces the other person to
             react without the time to think or plan. With no time to think, people make
             errors of
                         judgment, and are thrown on the defensive. This tactic is the ob-
             verse   of waiting and baiting, but it serves the same function: You make

             your enemy respond on your terms.
                 Men like Cesare Borgia and Napoleon used the element of speed to in-
             timidate ancl control. A rapid and unforeseen move is terrifying and de-
             moralizing. You must choose your tactics depending on the situation. If
             you have time on your side, and know that you and your enemies are at
             least at equal strength, then deplete their strength by making them come to

             you. If time is against you—-your enemies are weaker, and waiting will only
             give them the chance to recover—-give them no such chance. Strike quickly
             and they have nowhere to go. As the boxer Joe Louis put it, “He can run,
             but he can’t hide.”

                                    cover your tracks when you are practicing deception or are caught in a lie.

                                    In such cases it is to your advantage to argue with all the conviction you

                                    tain you appear, the less likely it seems that you are lying.
                                        This technique has saved the hide of many a con artist. Once Count
                                    Victor Lustig, swindle: par excellence, had sold dozens of suckers around
                                    the country a phony box with which he claimed to be able to copy money.
                                    Discovering their mistake, the suckers generally chose not to go the police,
                                    rather than risk the embarrassment of publicity. But one Sherifi Richards,



74          LAW 9
of Rernsen County, Oklahoma, was not the kind of man to accept being
conned out of $10,000, and one morning he tracked Lustig down to a hotel
in Chicago.

    Lustig heard a knock on the door. When he opened it he was looking
down the barrel of a gun. “What seems to be the problem?” he calmly
asked. “You son of a bitch,” yelled the sheriff, “I’m going to kill you. You
conned me with that damn box of yours!” Lustig feigned confusion. “You
mean it’s not   working?” he asked. “You know it’s not working,” replied the
sheriff. “But that’s impossible,” said Lustig. “There’s no way it couldn’t be
working. Did you operate it properly?” “I did exactly what you told me to
do,” said the sheriff. “No, you must have done something wrong,” said
Lustig. The argument went in circles. The barrel of the gun was gently low-
cred.
    Lustig next went to phase two in the argument tactic: He poured out a
whole bunch of technical gobbledygook about the borfis operation, com-

pletely beguiling the sheriff, who now appeared less sure of himself and ar-
gued less forcefully. “Look,” said Lusfig, “I’ll give you your money back
right now. I’ll also give you written instruclions on how to work the ma-
chine and I’ll come out to Oklahoma to make sure it’s working properly.
There’s no way you can lose on that.” The sheriff reluctantly agreed. To
satisfy him totally, Lustig took out a hundred one-hundred—dollar bills and
gave them to him, telling him to relax and have a fun weekend in Chicago.
Calmer and a little confused, the sheriff finally left Over the next few days
Lustig checked the paper every morning. He finally found what he was
looking for: A short arficle reporting Sheriff Richa.rcls’s arrest, trial, and
conviction for passing counterfeit notes. Lustig had won the argument; the
sheriff never bothered him again.

KEYS TO POWER
Those misfortunates among us who have been brought down by circum-

give them. But there are others who are not born to misfortune or unhappi~

change their patterns, but more often than not it is their patterns that end
up getting inside and changing us. The reason is siinple-humans are ex-

of those with whom they spend their time.

              sociation, you will also suffer in the eyes of others. Never underestimate the
              dangers of infection.
                   There are many kinds of infector to be aware of, but one of the most
              insidious is the sufferer from chronic dissatisfaction. Cassius, the Roman

              conspirator against Julius Caesar, had the discontent that comes from deep
              envy. He simply could not endure the presence of anyone of greater talent.
              Probably because Caesar sensed the man’s interminable soumess, he
              passed him up for the position of first praetorship, and gave the position to
              Brutus instead. Cassius brooded and broorled, his hatred for Caesar be
              coming pathological. Brutus himself, a. devoted republican, disliked Cae-
              sar’s dictatorship; had he had the patience to wait, he would have become
              the first man in Rome after Ca.esar‘s death, and could have undone the evil
              that the leader had wrought. But Cassius infected him with his own rancor,
              bending his ear daily with tales of Caesafs evil. He finally won Brutus over
              to the conspiracy. It was the beginning of a great tragedy. How many mis-

              fortunes could have been avoided had Brutus learned to fear the power of
              infection.
                  There is only one solution to infection: quarantine. But by the time
              you recognize the problem it is often too late. A Lola Montez oveiwhelms
              you with her forceful personality. Cassius intrigues you with his confiding
              nature and the depth of his feelings. How can you protect yourself against
              such insidious viruses? The answer lies in judging people on the effects
              they have on the world and not on the reasons they give for their prob-

              take pity. Do not enmesh yourself in trying to help. The infector will re

                   The other side of infection is equally valid, and perhaps more readily
              understood: There are people who attract happiness to themselves by their
              good cheer, natural buoyancy, and intelligence. They are a source of plea:
              sure, and you must associate with them to share in the prospeiity they draw

              upon themselves.
50   LAW 10
    This applies to more than good cheer and success: All positive quali~
ties can   infect us. Talley:-and had many strange and intimidating traits, but
most agreed that he surpassed all Frenchmen in gmciousness, aristocratic

charm, and wit. Indeed he came from one of the oldest noble families in
the country, and despite his belief in democracy and the French Republic,
he retained his courtly manners. His contemporary Napoleon was in many
ways the opposite~—~a peasant from Corsica, tacitum and ungracious, even
violent.
     There was no one Napoleon admired more than Talleyrand. He en-
vied his minister’s way with people, his wit and his                  ability to charm
women, and as best he could, he kept Talleyrand around him, hoping to
soak up the culture he lacked. There is no doubt that Napoleon changed as
his rule continued. Many of the rough edges were smoothed by his con-
stant association with Talleyrand.                                    .




    Use the positive side of this emotional osmosis to advantage. If, for ex-
ample, you are miserly by nature, you will never go beyond a certain limit;
only generous souls attain greatness. Associate with the generous, then,
and they will infect you, opening up everything that is tight and restricted
in you. If you are gloomy, gravitate to the cheerful. If you are prone to iso
lation, force yourselfto befriend the gregarious. Never associate with those
who share your defects——~they will reinforce everything that holds you
back. Only create associations with positive aflinities. Make this a rule of
life and you will benefit more than from all the therapy in the world.

                       nate so  that you may avoid
                       them. Misfortune is usually the
                       crime of folly, and among those
                       who suffer from it there is no
                       malady more contagious: Never
                       open your door to the least of
                       misfortunes, for, if you do, many
                       others will follow in its train.   .   .   .

oned, or executed. The problem was not ingratitude; it was that there were
so
   many other candottieri as able and valiant as they were. They were re-
placeable. Nothing was lost by killing them. Meanwhile, the older among
them had grown powerful themselves, and wanted more and more money
for their services. How much better, then, to do away with them and hire a

younger, cheaper mercenary. That was the fate of the Count of Carma-
gnola, who had started to act impudently and independently. He had taken
his power for granted without making sure that he was truly indispensable.
    Such is the fate (to a less violent degree, one hopes) of those who do
not make others   dependent on them. Sooner or later someone comes along
who can do the job as well as they can-—someone younger, fresher, less ex-
pensive, less threatening.
     Be the only one who can do what you do, and make the fate of those who
hire you so entwined with yours that they cannot possibly get rid of you.
Otherwise you will someday be forced to cross your own Bridge of Sighs.

When the prophecy came true, Louis was terrified, thinking that either the                 1703-1764

man  had murdered the woman to prove his accuracy or that he was so
versed in his science that his powers threatened Louis himself. In either
case he had to be    killed.
      One evening Louis summoned the astrologer to his room, high in the
castle. Before the man arrived, the king told his servants that when he gave


                                                                                                         LAW 11                  85
               the signal they were to pick the astrologer up, carry him to the window,
               and hurl him to the ground, hundreds of feet below.
                   The astrologer soon arrived, but before giving the signal, Louis de-
               cided to ask him one last question: “You claim to understand astrology and
               to know the fate of others, so tell me what your fate will be and how long

               you have to live.”
                   “I shall die just three days before Your Majesty," the astrologer replied.
               The kings signal was never given. The man’s life was spared. The Spider
               King not only protected his astrologer for as long as he was alive, he lav-
               ished him with gifts and had him tended by the finest court doctors.
                    The astrologer survived Louis by several years, disproving his power
               of prophecy but proving his mastery of power.
                    This is the model: Make others dependent on you. To get rid of you
               might spell disaster, even death, and your master dares not tempt fate by
               finding out. There are many ways to obtain such a position. Foremost
               among them is to possess a talent and creative skill that simply cannot be
               replaced.
                    During the Renaissance, the major obstacle to a pajntefls success was
               finding the right patron. Michelangelo did this better than anyone else: His
               patron was Pope julius H. But he and the pope quarreled over the building
               of the pope’s marble ‘comb, and Michelangelo left Rome in disgust To the
               amazement of those in the pope’s circle, not only did the pope not fire him,
               he sought him out and in his own haughty way begged the artist to stay.
               Michelangelo, he knew, could find another patron, but he could never find
               another Michelangelo.
                   You do not have to have the talent of 3. Michelangelo; you do have to
               have a skill that sets you apart from the crowd. You should create a situa-
               tion in which you can always latch on to another master or patron but your
               master cannot easily find another servant with your particular talent. And

               if, in reality, you are not actually indispensable, you must find a way to
               make it look as if you are. Having the appearance of specialized knowledge
               and skill gives you leeway in your ability to deceive those above you into
               thinking they cannot do without you. Real dependence on your master’s
               part, however, leaves him more vulnerable to you than the faked variety,
               and it is always within your power to make your skill indispensable.
                   This is what is meant by the intertwining of fates: Like creeping ivy,
               you have wrapped yourself around the source of power, so that it would
               cause
                     great trauma to cut you away. And you do not necessarily have to en-
               twine yourself around the master; another person will do, as long as he or
               she too is indispensable in the chain.
                    One day Harry Colin, president of Columbia Pictures, was visited in
               his office by a gloomy group of his executives. It was 1951, when the witch-
               hunc against Communists in Hollywood, carried on by the US. Congress’s
               House Un-American Activities Committee, was at its height. The execu-
               tives had bad news: One of their employees, the screenwriterjolm Howard

               Lawson, had been singled out as a Communist. They had to get rid of him
               night away or suffer the wrath of the committee.
86   LAW 1 l
     Harry Cohn was no bleeding—heart liberal; in fact, he had always been
a diehard
           Republican.
     His favorite politician was Benito Mussolini, whom he had once vis-
ited, and whose framed photo hung on his wall. If there was someone he
hated Cohn would call him a “Communist bastard.” But to the executives’
amazement Cohn told them he would not fire Lawson. He did not        keep the
screenwriter on because he was a good Writer—there were many good
writers in Hollywood. He kept him because of a chain of dependence:
Lawson was Humphrey Bogart’s writer and Bogart was Columbia’s star. If
Cohn messed with Lawson he would ruin an immensely profitable rela-
tionship. That was worth more than the terrible publicity brought to him
by his defiance of the committee.
     Henry Kissinger managed to survive the many bloodlettings that went
on in the Nixon White House not because he was the best
                                                           diplomat Nixon
could find—there were other fine negotiators»--and not because the two
men
      got along so well: They did not. Nor did they share their beliefs and
politics. Kissinger survived because he entrenched himself in so many
areas of the
              political structure that to do away with him would lead to
chaos. Michelangelds power was intensive, depending on one skill, his abil-
ity as an artist; Kissinger’s was extensive. He got himself involved in so
many aspects and departments of the administration that his involvement
became a card in his hand. It also made him many allies. If you can
arrange such a position for yourself, getting rid of you becomes
dangerous—all sorts of interdependencies will unravel. Still, the intensive
form of power provides more freedom than the extensive, because those
who have it depend on no particular master, or particular position of
power, for their security.
   To make others dependent on you, one route to take is the secret-
intelligence tactic. By knowing other people’s secrets, by holding informa-
tion that they wouldn’t want broadcast, you seal your fate with theirs. You
are untouchable. Ministers of secret   police have held this position through»
out the ages:   They   can make or break a
                                            king, or, as in the case of Edgar
Hoover, a president. But the role is so full of insecurities and paranoia that
the power it provides almost cancels itself out. You cannot rest at ease, and
what good is power if it brings you no peace?
    One last warning: Do not imagine that your master’s dependence on
you will make him love you. In fact, he may resent and fear you. But, as
Machiavelli said, it is better to be feared than loved. Fear you can control;
love, never. Depending on an emotion as subtle and changeable as love or
friendship will only make you insecure. Better to have others depend on
you out of fear of the consequences of losing you than out of love of your
company.

                    measure dependent on them. But trying to move beyond that point means

                    getting rid of those above you—it means standing alone, depending on no
                    one. Such is the
                                      monopolistic drive of a_]. P. Morgan or ajohn D. Rocke-
                    feller———to drive out all competition, to be in complete control. If you can
                    corner the market, so much the better.

                           No such independence comes without a price. You are forced to isolate

                     yourself. Monopolies often turn inward and destroy themselves from the in-
                     ternal pressure. They also stir up powerful resentment, making their ene-
                     mies bond together to fight them. The drive for complete control is often
                     ruinous and fruitless. Interdependence remains the law, independence a
                     rare and often fatal
                                          exception. Better to place yourself in a. position of mu-
                     tual dependence, then, and to follow this critical law rather than look for its
                     reversal. You will not have the unbearable pressure of being on top, and the
                     master above you will in essence be your slave, for kewill depend on you.

                                                          knew that most men build up defenses against crooks and other trouble-
                                                          makers. The con artists job is to bring those defenses down.

est? Lustig used selective honesty many times, but with Capone he went a

step further. No normal con man would have dared such a con; he would
have chosen his suckers for their meekness, for that look about them that
says they will take their medicine without complaint. Con Capone and you
would spend the rest of your life (whatever remained of it) afraid. But
Lustig understood that a man like Capone spends his life rrfistrusting oth-
ers.   No one around him is honest or generous, and being so much in the
company of wolves is exhausting, even depressing. A man like Capone
yearns to be the recipient of an honest or generous gesture, to feel that not
everyone has an angle or is out to rob him.
    Lusiig’s act of selective honesty disarmed Capone because it was so
unexpected. A con artist loves conflicting emotions like these, since the
person caught up in them is so easily distracted and deceived.
    Do not shy away from practicing this law on the Capones of the world.
With a well-timed gesture of honesty or generosity, you will have the most
brutal and cynical beast in the kingdom eating out of your hand.

KEYS ’l‘(.) P()\/\"l:lR
The essence of deception is distraction. Distracting the people you want to
deceive gives you the time and space to do something they won’: notice.
An act of kindness, generosity, or honesty is often the most powerful form
of distraction because it disanns other people’s suspicions. It tums them
into children, eagerly lapping up any kind of a.ft'ectiona.te gesture.
   In ancient China this was called “giving before you take”--the giving
makes it hard for the other person to notice the taldng. It is a device with
infinite practical uses. Brazenly taking something from someone is danger-
ous, even for the powerful. The victim will plot revenge. It is also danger-
ous
    simply to ask for what you need, no matter how politely: Unless the
other person sees some gain for themselves, they may come to resent your
neediness. Learn to give before you take. It softens the ground, takes the
bite out of a future request, or simply creates a distraction. And the giving
can take
         many forms: an actual gift, at generous act, a kind favor, an “l1on~
est” admission-—whatever it takes.
       Selective honesty is best employed on your first encounter with some
one. We are all creatures of     habit, and our first impressions last a long time.
If someone believes you are honest at the start of your relationship it takes
a lot to convince them otherwise. This
                                       gives you room to maneuver.
    jay Gould, like Al Capone, was a man who distrusted everyone.
By the time he was thirty—three he was already a multimillionaire,
mostly through deception and strong-arming. In the late 1860s, Gould in-
vested heavily in the Erie Railroad, then discovered that the market had

                                                                                      L/SW12   91
               been flooded with a vast amount of phony stock certificates for the com»

               party. He stood to lose a fortune and to suffer a lot of embarrassment.
                    In the midst of this crisis, a man named Lord john Gordon- Gordon of-
               fered to help. Gordon—Gordon, a Scottish lord, had apparently made a
               small fortune investing in railroads.
                   By hiring some handwriting experts 'Gordon—Gordon was able to
               prove to Gould that the culprits for the phony stock certificates were actu-
               ally several top executives with the Erie Railroad itself. Gould was grateful.
               Gordon«Gordon then proposed that he and Gould join forces to buy up a
               controlling interest in Erie. Gould agreed. For a while the venture ap-
               peared to prosper. The two men were now good friends, and every time
               Gordon—Gordon came to Gould asking for money to buy more stock,
               Gould gave it to him. In 1873, however, Gordon-Gordon suddenly
               dumped all of his stock, making a fortune but drastically lowering the value
               of Gould’s own holdings. Then he disappeared from sight.
                   Upon investigation, Gould found out that Gordon-Gordon’s real name
               was
                   john Crowningsfield, and that he was the bastard son of a merchant
               Seaman and a London barmaid. There had been many clues before             then
               that Goi-donvGordon was a con man, but his initial act of honesty and sup

               port had so blinded Gould that it took the loss of millions for him to see
               through the scheme.
                    A single act of honesty is often not enough. What is required is a repu-
               tation for honesty, built on a. series of acts-—but these can be quite inconse-

               quential. Once this reputation is established, as with first impressions, it is
               hard to shake.                                                               ~




                   In ancient China, Duke Wu of Chéng decided it was time to take over
               the increasingly powerful kingdom of Ho. Telling no one of his plan, he
               married his daughter to Hu’s ruler. He then called a oouncil and asked his
               ministers, “I am considering a military campaign. Which country should
               we invade?” As he had    expected, one of his ministers replied, “H11 should
               be invaded.” The duke seemed angry, and said, “Hu is a sister state now.
               Why do you suggest invading her?” He had the minister executed for his
               impolitic remark. The ruler of Hu heard about this, and considering other
               tokens of Wu’s honesty and the marriage with his daughter, he took no pre-
               cautions to defend himself from Chéng. A few weeks later, Chéng forces

               swept through Hu and took the country, never to relinquish it.
                    Honesty is one of the best ways to disarm the wary, but it is not the
               only one. Any kind of noble, apparently selfless act will serve. Perhaps the
               best such act, though, is one of generosity. Few people can resist a gift, even
               from the most hardened enemy, which is why it is often the perfect way to
               disarm people. A gift brings out the child in us, instantly lowering our dc»
               lenses. Although we often view other people’s actions in the most cynical
               light, we rarely see the Machiavellian element of a gift, which quite often
               hides ulterior motives. A gift is the perfect object in which to hide a decep—

                   Over three thousand years ago the ancient Greeks traveled across the

and a quick victory      on                           the other, chose the
horse, which was promptly built. The trick was successful and Troy fell.
One gift did more for the Greek cause than ten years of fighting.
      Selective kindness should also be part of your arsenal of deception. For

years the ancient Romans had besieged the city of the Faliscans, always un~
successfully. One day, however, when the Roman general Camillus was
encamped outside the city, he suddenly saw a man leading some children
toward him. The man was a Faliscan teacher, and the children, it turned
out, were the sons and daughters of the noblest and wealthiest citizens of
the town. On the pretense of taking these children out for a walk, he had
led them straight to the Romans, offering them as hostages in hopes of in-

gratiating himself with Camillus, the city’s enemy.
      Camillus did not take the children hostage. He stripped the teadier,
tied his hands behind his back, gave each child a rod, and let them whip
him all the way back to the city. The gesture had an immediate effect on
the Faliscans. Had Camillus used the children as hostages, some in the city
would have voted to surrender. And even if the Faliscans had gone on

fighting, their resistance would have been halfhearted. Camillus’s refusal to
take advantage of the situation broke down the Faliscans’ resistance, and

they surrendered. The general had calculated correctly. And in any case he
had had nothing to lose: He knew that the hostage ploy would not have
ended the war, at least not right away. By turning the situation around, he
earned his enemy’s trust and respecg disarming them. Selective kindness
will often break down even the most stubborn foe: Aiming right for the
heart, it corrodes the will to fight back.
      Remember: By playing on people’s emotions, calculated acts of kind-
ness can  turn a Capone into a gullible child. As with any emotional ap-

proach, the  tactic must be practiced with caution: If people see through it,
their disappointed feelings of gratitude and warmth will become the most
violent hatred and distrust Unless you can make the gesture seem sincere
and heartfelt, do not play with fire.

              REVERSAL
              When you have a history of deceit behind you, no amount of honesty, gen-
              erosity, or kindness will fool people. In fact it will only call attention to it-
              self. Once people have come to see you as deceitful, to act honest all of a
              sudden is simply suspicious. In these cases it is better to play the rogue.
                  Count Lustig, pulling the biggest can of his career, was about to sell
              the Eiffel Tower to an unsuspecting indusixialist who believed the govern-
              ment was    auctioning it off for scrap metal. The industrialist was prepared
              to hand over a huge sum of money to Lustig, who had successfully imper-
              sonated a government official. At the last minute, however, the mark was
              suspicious. Something about Lustig bothered him. At the meeting in which
              he was to hand over the money, Lustig sensed his sudden distrust.

                  Leaning over to the industrialist, Lustig explained, in a low whisper,
              how low his salary was, how difficult his finances were, on and on. After a
              few minutes of this, the industlialist realized that Lustig was asking for a
              bribe. For the first time he relaxed. Now he knew he could trust Lustig:
              Since all government officials were dishonest, Lustig had to be real. The
              man     forked over the money. By acting dishonest, Lustig seemed the real
              McCoy. In this case selective honesty would have had the opposite effect.
                   As the French diplomat Talleyrand grew older, his reputation as a mas-
              ter liar and deceiver spread. At the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815), he

              would spin fabulous stories and make impossible remarlm to people who
              knew he had to be lying. His dishonesty had no purpose except to cloak
              the moments when he really was deceiving them. One day, for example,
              among friends, Talleyrand said with apparent sincerity, “In business one
              ought to show one’s hand.” No one who heard him could believe their
              ears:   A man who never once in his life had shown his cards was telling
              other people to show theirs. Tactics like this made it impossible to distin-
              guish Talleyi-and’s real decepfions from his fake ones. By embracing his
              reputation for dishonesty, he preserved his ability to deceive.
                    Nothing in the realm of power is set in stone. Overt deceptiveness will
              sometimes cover your tracks, even making you admired for the honesty of

              your dishonesty.

                                            and listen to their complaints. This, he said, was the only just thing to do,
                                            since the family had willingly laid down their arms and had always sup-

                                                Castmccio listened patiently. He seemed not the slightest bit angry or
                                            resentful. Instead, he told Stefano to rest assured that justice would prevail,
                                            and he asked him to bring his entire family to the palace to talk over their
                                            grievances and come to an agreement. As they took leave of one another,
                                            Castruccio said he thanked God for the chance he had been given to show
                                            his clemency and kindness. That evening the entire Poggio family came to
                                            the palace. Castruccio immediately had them imprisoned and a few days
                                            later all were executed, including Stefano.

of his obligations to the Poggios by eliminating the Poggios.



OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 4-33 B.C., just before the Peloponnesian War, the island of Corcyra (later
called Corfu) and the Greek city~state of Corinth stood on the brink of con-
flict. Both parties sent ambassadors to Athens to try to win over the Atheni~
ans to their side. The stakes were   high, since whoever had Athens on his
side was sure to win. And whoever won the war would certainly give the
defeated side no mercy.
     Corcyra spoke first. Its ambassador began by admitting that the island
had never helped Athens before, and in fact had allied itself with Athens’s
enemies. There were no ties of friendship or gratitude between Corcyra
and Athens. Yes, the ambassador achnitted, he had come to Athens now
out of fear and concern for Corcyra’s safety. The only thing he could offer
was an alliance of mutual interests. Corcyra had a navy only
                                                              surpassed in
size and strength by Athens’s own; an alliance between the two states
would create a formidable force, one that could intimidate the rival state of
Sparta. That, unfortunately, was all Oorcyra had to offer.
     The   representative from Corinth then gave a brilliant, passionate
speech, in sharp contrast to the dry, colorless approach of the Corcyran.
He talked of everything Corinth had done for Athens in the past. He asked
how it would look to Athens’s other allies if the city put an agreement with
a   former enemy over one with       a
                                         present friend, one that had served
Athens’s interest loyally: Perhaps those allies would break their agreements
with Athens if they saw that their loyalty was not valued. He referred to
Hellenic law, and the need to repay Corinth for all its good deeds. He fi-
nally went on to list the many services Corinth had performed for Athens,
and the importance of showing gratitude to one’s friends.
     After the speech, the Athenians debated the issue in an assembly. On

                                                                                              LAW I3        97
                 the second round, they voted overwhelmingly to ally with Corcyra and
                 drop Corinth.

                 Interpretation
                 History has remembered the Athenians nobly, but they were the preemi-
                 nent realists of classical Greece. With them, all the rhetoric, all the emo-
                 tional appeals in the world, could not match a good pragmatic argument,
                 especially one that added to their power.
                     What the Corinthian ambassador did not realize was that his refer-
                 ences to   Corinth’s past generosity to Athens only irritated the Athenians,
                 subtly asking them to feel guilty and putting them under obligation. The
                 Athenians couldn’t care less about past favors and friendly feelings. At the
                 same time, they knew that if their other allies thought them ungrateful for

                 abandoning Corinth, these city-states would still be unlikely to break their
                 ties to Athens, the preeminent power in Greece. Athens ruled its empire by
                 force, and would simply compel any rebellious ally to return to the fold.
                       When people choose between talk about the past and talk about the
                 future, a pragmatic person will always opt for the future and forget the past.
                 As the Corcyrans realized, it is always best to speak pragmatically to a
                 pragmatic person. And in the end, most people are in fast pragmatic-—they
                 will rarely act against their own self-interest.


                       It has always been a rule that the weak should be subject to the strong;
                        and besides, we consider that we am worthy of our power. Up till the
                        present moment you, too, used to think that we were; but now. after
                      calculating your own interest, you are beginning to talk in terms of right

                 KEYS TO POWER
                 In your quest for power, you will constantly find yourself in the position of
                 asking for help from those more powerful than you. There is an art to ask-
                 ing for help, an art that depends on your ability to understand the person
                 you are dealing with, and to not confuse your needs with theirs.
                      Most people never succeed at this, because they are completely
                 trapped in their own wants and desires. They start from the assumption
                 that the people they are appealing to have a selfless interest in helping
                 them. They talk as if their needs mattered to these peopleowho probably
                 couldn’t care less. Sometimes they refer to larger issues: a great cause, or
                 grand emotions such as love and gratitude. They go for the big picture
                 when simple, everyday realities would have much more appeal. What they
                 do not realize is that even the most powerful person is locked inside needs
                 of his own, and that if you make no appeal to his selfdnterest, he merely
                 sees you as desperate or, at best, a waste of time.


‘)5’:   LAW 13
      In the sixteenth century, Portuguese missionaries tried for years to con
vert the   people ofjapan to Catholicism, while at the same time Portugal
had a monopoly on trade between japan and Europe. Although the mis-
sionaries did have some success, they never got far among the ruling elite;

by the beginning of the seventeenth century, in fact, their proselytizing had
completely antagonized the Japanese emperor Ieyasu. When the Dutch
began to arrive in japan in great numbers, Ieyasu was much relieved. He
needed Europeans for their know-how in guns and navigation, and here at
last were Europeans who cared nothing for spreading religion——the Dutch
wanted only to trade. Ieyasu swiftly moved to evict the Portuguese. From
then on, he would only deal with the practicalminded Dutch.
      Japan and Holland were vastly different cultures, but each shared a
timeless and universal concern: selfiinterest. Every person you deal with is
like another culuire, an alien land with a past that has nothing to do with
yours. Yet you can bypass the differences between you and him by appeal-
ing to his self—interest. Do not be subtle: You have valuable knowledge to
share, you will fill his coffers with gold, you will make him live longer and
happier. This is a language that all of us speak and understand.
      A key step in the process is to understand the other person’s psychol~
ogy. Is he vain? Is he concerned about his reputation or his social standing?
Does he have enemies you could help him vanquish? Is he simply mod»
vated by money and power?
      When the Mongols invaded China in the twelfth century, they threab
erred to obliterate a culture that had thrived for over two thousand years.
Their leader, Genghis Khan, saw nothing in China. but a country that
lacked pasturing for his horses, and he decided to destroy the place, IeveI~
ing all its cities, for “it would be better to exterminate the Chinese and let
the grass grow.” It was not a soldier, a. general, or a king who saved the
Chinese from devastation, but a man named Yelu Ch’u—Ts’ai. A foreigner
himself, Ch’u«Ts’ai had come to appreciate the superiority of Chinese cul-
ture. He managed to make himself a trusted adviser to Genghis Khan, and

persuaded him that he would reap riches out of the place if, instead of de
straying it, he simply taxed everyone who lived there. Khan saw the wis-
dom in this and did as Ch’u—Ts‘a.i advised.
      When Khan took the city of Kaifeng, after a long siege, and decided to
massaxtre   its inhabitants (as he had in other cities that had resisted him),
Ch’u~Ts’ai told him that the finest craftsmen and engineers in China had
fled to Kaifeng, and it would be better to put them to use. Kaifeng was
spared. Never before had Genghis Khan shown such mercy, but then it
really wasn’t mercy that saved Kaifeng. Ch‘u—Ts’ai knew Khan well. He was
a barbaric peasant who cared nothing for culuire, or indeed for anything

other than warfare and practical results. Ch’u—Ts’ai chose to appeal to the
only emotion that would work on such a man: greed.
    Self-interest is the lever that will move people. Once you make them
see how you can in some way meet their needs or advance their cause,
their resistance to your requests for help will magically fall away. At each
step on the way to acquiring power, you must train yourself to think your
                                                                                 LAW 13   99

                Some people will see an appeal to their selfiinterest as ugly and ignoble.
                They actually prefer to be able to exercise charity, mercy, and justice,
                which are their ways of feeling superior to you: When you beg them for
                help, you emphasize their power and position. They are strong enough to
                need nothing from you except the chance to feel superior. This is the wine
                that intoxicates them. They are dying to fund your project, to introduce
                you to powerful people———provided, of course, that all this is done in public,
                and for a good cause (usually the more public, the better). Not everyone,
                then, can be approached through cynical self—interest. Some people will be
                put off by it, because they dorft want to seem to be motivated by such
                things. They need opportunities to display their good heart,
                     Do not be shy. Give them that opportunity. It’s not as if you are con»

                seen
                      giving. You must distinguish the differences among powerful people
                and figure out what makes them tick. When they ooze greed, do not appeal
                to their charity. When they want to look charitable and noble, do not ap-

                peal to their greed.

               OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW

               Joseph Duveen was undoubtedly the greatest art dealer of his time—from
                1904 to 194-0 he almost single—handedly rnonopolized America’s million-
                aire art-collecting market. But one prize plum eluded him: the industrialist
               Andrew Mellon. Before he died, Duveen was determined to make Mellon
               a   client.
                      Duveen’s friends said this was an impossible dreani. Mellon was a stiff,
               taciturn man. The stories he had heard about the congenial, talkative Du-
               veen rubbed him the
                                       wrong way—-he had made it clear he had no desire to
               meet the man. Yet Duveen told his  doubting friends, “Not only will Mellon
               buy from me but he will buy only from me.” For several years he tracked
               his prey, learning the man’s habits, tastes, phobias. To do this, he secretly

               put several of Mellon’s staff on his own payroll, worming valuable informa-
               tion out of them. By the time he moved into action, he knew Mellon about
               as well as Mellon’s wife did.

                      In 1921 Mellon was visiting London, and staying in a palatial suite on
               the third floor of Claridge’s Hotel. Duveen booked himself into the suite

               just below Mellon’s, on the second floor. He had arranged for his valet to
               befriend Mellon’s valet, and on the fateful day he had chosen to make his
               move, Mellon’s valet told Duveen’s valet, who told Duveen, that he had

               just helped Mellon on with his overcoat, and that the industrialist was mak-
                ing his way down the corridor to ring for the lift.
                     Duveen’s valet hurriedly helped Duveen with his own overcoat. Sec»
               onds later, Duveen entered the lift, and lo and behold, there was Mellon.
               “How do you do, Mr. Mellon?” said Duveen, introducing himself. “I am on

               my way to the National Gallery to look at some pictures.” How uncanny-
               that was precisely where Mellon was headed. And so Duveen was able to

               accompany his prey to the one location that would ensure his success. He
               knew Mellon’s taste inside and out, and while the two men wandered
               through the museum, he dazzled the magnate with his knowledge. Once
               again quite uncannily, they seemed to have remarkably similar tastes.
                    Mellon was pleasantly surprised: This was not the Duveen he had ex-

               pected. The man was charming and agreeable, and clearly had exquisite
               taste. When they returned to New York, Mellon visited Duveen’s exclusive

               gallery and fell in love with the collection. Everything, surprisingly enough,
               seemed to be precisely the kind of work he wanted to collect. For the rest
               of his life he was Duveen’s best and most generous client.


               Interpretation
               A man as ambitious and competitive as Joseph Duveen left nothing to
               chance. What’s the point of winging ig of just hoping you may be able to
               charm this or that client? It’s like shooting ducks blindfolded. Arm yourself
               with a little knowledge and your aim improves.
                      Mellon was the most spectacular of Duveen’s catches, but he spied on
               many a millionaire. By secretly putting members of his clients’ household
               staffs on his own payroll, he would gain constant access to valuable infor-



I02   LAW 14
mation about their masters’    comings and goings, changes in taste, and
other such tidbits of information that would put him a step ahead. A rival
of Duveen’s who wanted to make Henry Frick a client noticed that when-
ever   he visited this wealthy New Yorker, Duveen was there before him, as
if he had a sixth sense. To other dealers Duveen seemed to be everywhere,
and to know everything before they did. His powers discouraged and dis-
heartened them, until many simply gave up going after the wealthy clients
who could make a dealer rich.
     Such is the power of artful spying: It makes you seem all—powerful,
clairvoyant. Your knowledge of your mark can also make you seem charm-
ing, so well can you anticipate his desires. No one sees the source of your
power, and what they cannot see they cannot fight.

         Rulers see through spies, as cows through smell, Bmhmins through

            scriptures and the rest of the people through their normal eyes.

KEYS TO POWER
In the realm of power, your goal is a degree of control over future events.
Part of the problem you face, then, is that people won’t tell you all their
thoughts, emotions, and plans. Controlling what they say, they often keep
the most critical parts of their character hidden—their weaknesses, ulterior
motives, obsessions. The result is that you cannot predict their moves, and
are
      constantly in the dark. The trick is to find a way to probe them, to find
out their secrets   and hidden intentions, without letting them know what
you are up to.
    This is not as difficult as you might think. A friendly front will let you
secretly gather information on friends and enemies alike. Let others con-
sult the horoscope, or read tarot cards: You have more concrete means of
seeing into the future.
     The most common way of spying is to use other people, as Duveen
did. The method is simple, powerful, but risky: You will certainly gather in-
formation, but you have little control over the people who are doing the
work. Perhaps they will ineptly reveal your spying, or even secretly turn
against you. It is far better to be the spy yourself, to pose as a friend while
secretly gathering information.
     The French politician Talleyrand was one of the greatest practitioners
of this art. He had an uncanny ability to worm secrets out of people in pa-
lite conversation. A contemporary of his, Baron de Vitrolles, wrote, “Wit
and grace marked his conversation. He possessed the art of concealing his
thoughts or his malice beneath a transparent veil of insinuations, words
that imply something more than they express. Only when necessary did he

inject his own personality.” The key here is Talleyrand’s ability to suppress
himself in the conversation, to make others talk endlessly about themselves
and inadvertently reveal their intentions and plans.



                                                                                  LAW 14   103

                                    self and your intentions than about the information you hope to find.
                                        A trick to try in spying comes from La Rochefoucauld, who wrote,

                                    “Sincerity is found in very few men, and is often the cleverest of ruses——
                                    one is sincere in order to draw out the confidence and secrets of the other.”


                                    By pretending to bare your heart to another person, in other words, you
                                    make them more likely to reveal their own secrets. Give them a false con‘
                                    fession and they will give you a real one. Another trick was identified by
                                    the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, who suggested vehemently contra-
                                    dicting people you’re in conversation with as a way of irritating them, stir—
                                    ring them up so that they lose some of the control over their words. In their
                                    emotional reaction they will reveal all kinds of truths about themselves,
                                    truths you can later use against them.
                                        Another method of indirect spying is to test people, to lay little traps
                                    that make them reveal things about themselves. Chosroes II, a notoriously
                                    clever seventlrcentury king of the Persians, had many ways of seeing
                                    through his subjects without raising suspicion. If he noticed, for instance,
                                    that two of his couruers had become particularly friendly, he would call
                                    one of them aside and
                                                          say he had information that the other was a traitor,
                                    and would soon be killed. The king would tell the courtier he tmsted him
                                    more than anyone, and that he must       keep this information secret. Then he

 104        LAW 14
would watch the two men carefully. If he saw that the second courtier had
not   changed in his behavior toward the king, he would conclude that the
first courtier had kept the secret, and he would quickly promote the man,
later taking him aside to confess, “I meant to kill your friend because of
certain information that had reached me, but, when I investigated the mat-

ter, I found it was untrue.” If, on the other hand, the second courtier started
to avoid the king, acting aloof and tense, Chosroes would know that the se

cret had been revealed. He would ban the second courtier from his court,

letting him know that the whole business had only been a test, but that
even
       though the man had done nothing wrong, he could no longer trust
him. The first courtier, however, had revealed a secret, and him Chosroes
would ban from his entire kingdom.
      It may seem an odd form of spying that reveals not empirical informa:
tion but a person’s character. Often, however, it is the best way of solving

problems before they arise.
     By tempting people into certain acts, you learn about their loyalty,
their honesty, and so on. And this kind of knowledge is often the most
valuable of all: Armed with it, you can predict their actions in the future.

                       gives you the omniscience

                        others, and you see deeper

   Authority: Now, the reason a brilliant sovereign and a wise general
   conquer the enemy whenever they move, and their achievements
   surpass those of ordinary men, is their foreknowledge of the enemy
   situation. This “foreknowledge” cannot be elicited from spirits, nor
   from gods, nor by analogy with past events, not by astrologic calcu
   lations. It must be obtained from men who know the enemy sit-
   uati0n—-from    spies. (Sun-tzu, The Art if War, fourth century B.C.)

                                                                                  LAW 14   I05
              REVERSAL
              Information is critical to power, but just as you spy on other people, you
              must be prepared for them to spy on you. One of the most potent weapons
              in the battle for information, then, is giving out false information. As Mn-
              ston   Churchill said, “Truth is so precious that she should always be at»
              tended by a bodyguard of lies.” You must surround yourself with such a
              bodyguard, so that your truth cannot be penetrated. By planting the infor-
              mation of your choice, you control the game.
                     In 1944 the Nazis’ rocket-bomb attacks on London suddenly escalated.
              Over two thousand V-1 flying bombs fell on the city, killing more than five
              thousand people and wounding many more, Somehow, however, the Ger-
              mans
                       consistently missed their targets. Bombs that were intended for
              Tower Bridge, or Piccadilly, would fall well short of the city, landing in the
              less populated suburbs. This was because, in fixing their targets, the Ger-
              mans    relied on secret agents they had planted in England. They did not
              know that these agents had been         discovered, and that in their place,
              English—c0ntrolled agents   were   feeding them subtly deceptive information.
                     The bombs would hit farther and farther from their targets every time

              they fell. By the end of the campaign they were landing on cows in the
              country. By feeding people wrong information, then, you gain a potent ad
              vantage. While spying gives you a third eye, disinformation puts out one of
              your enemy’s eyes. A cyclops, he always misses his target.

                                               Pang, headed straight toward Ch’in. The target was the kingdom’s splendid
                                               capital, Hsien-yang. And Hsiang Yu, ever violent and impatient, could not

                                                 this—--she had yet to provide the emperor with an heir, her position was
                                                 vulnerable, and Wu was a valuable ally.
                                                      In 654 Wu Chao gave birth to a child. One day the empress came to
                                                 visit, and as soon as she had left, Wu smothered the newborn——her own
                                                 baby. When the murder was discovered, suspicion immediately fell on the
                                                 empress, who had been on the scene moments earlier, and whose jealous
                                                 nature was known by all. This was precisely Wu’s plan. Shortly thereafter,
                                                 the empress was charged with murder and executed. Wu Chao was
                                                 crowned empress in her place. Her new husband, addicted to his life of
                                                 pleasure, gladly gave up the reins of government to Wu Chao, who was
                                                 from then on known as Empress Wu.
                                                       Although now in a position of great power, Wu hardly felt secure.
                                                 There were enemies everywhere; she could not let down her guard for one
                                                 moment. Indeed, when she was forty-one, she began to fear that her bean~

                                                 woman with a clay mixed into her food. In 675 her own son, touted as the

heir apparent, was poisoned as well. The next—eldest son———illegil:'ma.te, but
now   the crown prince——was exiled a little later on trumped—up charges.
And when the emperor died, in 683, Wu managed to have the son after
that declared unfit for the throne. All flris meant that it was her youngest,
most ineffectual son who   finally ‘became emperor. In this way she contin-
ued to rule.
    Over the next five years there were innumerable palace coups. All of
them failed, and all of the conspirators were executed. By 688 there was no
one   left to challenge Wu. She proclaimed herself a divine descendant of
Buddha, and in 690 her wishes were finally granted: She was named Holy
and Divine “Emperor” of China.
      Wu became emperor because there was literally nobody le-R from the

previous "Pang dynasty. And so she ruled unchallenged, for over a decade
of relative peace. In 705, at the age of eighty, she was forced to abdicate.


Interpretation
All who knew Empress Wu remarked on her energy and intelligence. At
the time, there was no glory available for an ambitious woman beyond a
few years in the imperial harem, then a lifetime walled up in a convent. In
Wu’s gradual but remarkable rise to the top, she was never naive. She
knew that any hesitation, any momentary weakness, would spell her and.
If, every time she got rid of a rival a new one appeared, the solution was
simple: She had to crush them all or be killed herself. Other emperors be
fore her had followed the same path to the top, but Wu-«who, as a woman,
had next to no chance to gain power———had to be more ruthless still.
     Empress Wu’s forly—year reign was one of the longest in Chinese his-
tory. Although the story of her bloody rise to power is well known, in
China she is considered one of the period’s most able and effective rulers.

KEYS TO POWER
It is no accident that the two stories illustrating this law come from China:
Chinese history abounds with examples of enemies who were left alive and
returned to haunt the lenient. “Crush the enemy” is a key strategic tenet of
Surrtzu, the fourth—century—B.C. author of The Art ofl/Wzr. The idea is simple:
Your enemies wish you ill. There is nothing they want more than to elimi-
nate you. If, in your struggles with them, you stop halfway or even three

quarters of the way, out of mercy or hope of reconciliation, you only make
them more determined, more embittered, and they will someday take re-
venge. They may act friendly for the time being, but this is only because
you have defeated them. They have no choice but to bide their time.
      The solution: Have no mercy. Crush your enemies as totally as they


                                                                                  LAW 15   I71
               would crush you. Ultimately the only peace and security you can hope for
               from your enemies is their disappearance.
                   Mao Tse—tung, a devoted reader of Sun—tzu and of Chinese history gexr
               erally, knew the importance of this law. In i934 the Communist leader and
               some   75,000 poorly equipped soldiers fled into the desolate mountains of
               western China to escape Chiang K.ai—shek’s much larger army, in what has
               since been called the Long March.

                     Chiang was determined to eliminate every last Communist, and by a
               few years later Mao had less than     10,000 soldiers left. By 1937, in fact,
               when China was invaded by japan, Chiang calculated that the Commu-
               nists were no longer a threat. He chose to give up the chase and conceir
               trate on the Japanese. Ten years later the Communists had recovered

               enough to rout Chia.ng’s army. Chiang had forgotten the ancient wisdom of
               crushing the enemy; Mao had not. Chiang was pursued until he and his en-
               tire army fled to the island of Taiwan. Nothing remains of his regime in
               mainland China to this day.
                     The wisdom behind “crushing the enemy” is as ancient as the Bible:
               Its first practitioner may have been Moses, who learned it from God Him«
               self, when He parted the Red Sea for the Jews, then let the water {low back
               over the
                           pursuing Egyptians so that “not so much as one of them re-
               mained.” When Moses returned from Mount Sinai with the Ten Corn-
               mandments and found his people worshipping the Golden Calf, he had
               every last offender slaughtered. And just before he died, he told his follow-
               ers, finally about to enter the Promised Land, that when they had defeated
               the tribes of Canaan they should “utterly destroy them                        .   .   .   make no
               covenant with them, and show no mercy to them.”
                   The goal of total victory is an axiom of modern warfare, and was codi-
               fied as such by Carl von Clausewitz, the premier philosopher of war. Ana»
               lyzing the campaigns of Napoleon, von Clausewitz wrote, “We do claim
               that direct annihilation of the enemy’s forces must always be the dominant
               consideration.   .   .   .   Once a major victory is achieved there must be no talk of
               rest, of breathing space            .   .   .   but only of the pursuit, going for the enemy
               again,  seizing his capital, attacking his reserves and anything else that
               might give his country   aid and comfort.” The reason for this is that afier
               war some
                          negotiation and the division of territory. If you have only won a
               partial victory, you will inevitably lose in negotiation what you have
               gained by war.
                    The solution is simple: Allow your enemies no options. Annihilate
               them and their territory is yours to carve. The goal of power is to control
               your enemies completely, to make them obey your will. You cannot afford
               to go halfway. If they have no options, they will be forced to do your bid-

               ding. This law has applications far beyond the battlefield. Negotiation is the
               insidious viper that will eat away at your victory, so give your enemies
               nothing to negotiate, no hope, no room to maneuver. They are crushed
               and that is that.
                    Realize this: In your struggle for power you will stir up rivalries and

nize that there is no possibility of peace between you, especially as long as

you stay in power. If you let them stick around, they will seek revenge, as
certainly as night follows day. To wait for them to show their cards is just
silly; as Empress Wu understood, by then it will be too late.
   Be realistic: With an enemy like this around, you will never be secure.
Remember the lessons of history, and the wisdom of Moses and Mao:
Never go halfway.
    It is not, of course, a question of murder, it is a question of banishment.

Sufficiently weakened and then exiled from your court forever, your ene-
mies are rendered harmless. They have no hope of recovering, insinuating
themselves and hurting you. And if they cannot be banished, at least un-
derstand that they are plotting against you, and pay no heed to whatever
friendliness they feign. Your only weapon in such a situation is your own
war-iness. If you cannot banish them immediately, then
                                                         plot for the best
time to act.

                   RE VE RSAL
                   This law should very rarely be ignored, but it does sometimes happen that
                   it is better to let your enemies destroy themselves, if such a thing is possi-

                   ble, than to make them suffer by your hand. In warfare, for example, a
                   good general knows that if he attacks an army when it is cornered, its sol-
                   diers will fight much more fiercely. It is sometimes better, then, to leave
                   them an escape route, a way out As they retreat, they wear themselves out,
                   and are ultimately more demoralized by the retreat than by any defeat he
                   might inflict on the battlefield. When you have someone on the ropes,
                   then——-but only when you are sure they have no chance of recovery--you
                   might let them hang themselves. Let them be the agents of their own de-
                   struction. The result will be the same, and you won‘t feel half as bad.

                        Finally, sometimes by crushing an enemy, you embitter them so much
                   that they spend years and years plotting revenge. The Treaty of Versailles
                   had such an effect on the Germans. Some would argue that in the long run
                   it would be better to show some leniency. The problem is, your leniency
                   involves another n'sk—it may embolden the enemy, which still harbors a

                   grudge, but now has some room to operate. It is almost always wiser to
               "




                   crush your enemy. If they plot revenge years later, do not let your guard
                   down, but simply crush them again.

               OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
               For many centuries the Assyrians ruled upper Asia with an iron fist. In the

               eighth century B.C., however, the people of Medea (now northwestern
               Iran) revolted against them, and finally broke free. Now the Medes had to
               establish a new government. Determined to avoid any form of despotism,
               they refused to give ultimate power to any one man, or to establish a
               monarchy. Without a leader, however, the country soon fell into chaos,
               and fractured into small kingdoms, with village fighting against village.
                    In one such village lived a man named Deioces, who began to make a
               name for himself for fair dealing and the ability to settle disputes.

                    He did this so successfully, in fact, that soon any legal conflict in the
               area was brought to him, and his
                                                   power increased. Throughout the land,
               the law had fallen into disrepute-——the judges were corrupt, and no one en-
               trusted their cases to the courts any more, resorting to violence instead.
               When news spread of Deioces’ wisdom, incormptibility, and unshakable
               impartiality, Medean villages far and wide turned to him to settle all man-
               ner of cases.   Soon he became the sole arbiter of justice in the land.
                   At the height of his power, Deioces suddenly decided he had had

               enough. He would no longer sit in the chair of judgment, would hear no
               more suits, settle no more
                                          disputes between brother and brother, village
               and village. Complaining that he was spending so much time dealing with
               other people’s problems that he had neglected his own affairs, he retired.
               The country      once   again descended into chaos. With the sudden with-
               drawal of a powerful arbiter like Deioces, crime increased, and contempt
               for the law was never greater. The Medes held a meeting of all the villages
               to decide how to get out of their   predicament. “We cannot continue to live
               in this country under these conditions,” said one tribal leader. “Let us ap-

               point one of our number to rule so that we can live under orderly govern-
               ment, rather than losing our homes altogether in the present chaos.”
                    And so, despite all that the Medes had suffered under the Assyrian des-
               potism, they decided to set up a monarchy and name a king. And the man
               they most wanted to rule, of course, was the fair-minded Deioces. He was
               hard to convince, for he wanted nothing more to do with the villages’ in-

               fighting and bickering, but the Medes begged and pleaded—without him the
               country had descended into a state of lawlessness. Deioces finally agreed.
                   Yet he also imposed conditions. An enormous palace was to be con-
               structed for him, he was to be provided with bodyguards, and a capital city
               was to   be built from which he could rule. All of this was done, and Deioces
               settled into his palace. In the center of the capital, the palace was sur-
               rounded by walls, and completely inaccessible to ordinary people. Deioces
               then established the terms of his rule: Admission to his presence was for-
               bidden. Communication with the king was only possible through messen-

               gers. No one in the royal court could see him more than once a week, and
               then only by permission.
                    Deioces ruled for fifty—three years, extended the Medean empire, and
               established the foundation for what would later be the Persian empire,
               under his great—great—grandson Cyrus. During Deioces’ reign, the people’s

118   LAW 16
respect for him gradually turned into a form of worship: He was not a mere
mortal, they believed, but the son of a god.

Interpretation
Deioces was a man of great ambition. He determined early on that the
country needed a strong ruler, and that he was the man for the job.
      ln a land plagued with anarchy, the most powerful man is the judge
and arbiter. So Deioces began his career by making his reputation as a man
of impeccable fairness.
     At the height of his power as a judge, however, Deioces realized the
truth of the law of absence and presence: By serving so many clients, he
had become too noticeable, too available, and had lost the respect he had
earlier enjoyed. People were taking his services for granted. The only way
to   regain the veneration and power he wanted was to withdraw com-
pletely, and let the Medes taste what life was like without him. As he ex-
pected, they came begging for him to rule.
      Once Deioces had discovered the truth of this law, he carried it to its
ultimate realization. In the palace his people had built for him, none could
see him
       except a few courtiers, and those only rarely. As Herodotus wrote,
“There was a risk that if they saw him habitually, it might lead to jealousy
and resentment, and plots would follow; but if nobody saw him, the legend
would grow that he was a being of a different order from more men.”


       A man said to a Dervish.‘ “Why do I not see you mm ofim?" The Dervish

          replied, “Because the words ‘Why have you not been to see me?’ are
                                                                                 ”
            sweeter to my ear than the words ‘Why have you come again .9’

KEYS TO POWER
Everything in the world depends on absence and presence. A strong pres-
ence will draw
                power and attention to you—you shine more brightly than
those around you. But a point is inevitably reached where too much pres-
ence creates the
                  opposite effect: The more you are seen and heard from,
the more your value degrades. You become a habit. No matter how hard
you try to be different, subtly, without your knowing why. people respect
you less and less. At the right moment you must leam to withdraw yourself
before they unconsciously push you away. It is a game of hide—and~seek.
     The truth of this law can most easily be appreciated in matters of love
and seduction. In the beginning stages of an affair, the 1over‘s absence stim-
ulates your imagination, forming a sort of aura around him or her. But this
aura fades when
                   you know too much--~when your imagination no longer
has room to roam. The loved one becomes a person like anyone else, a
person whose presence is taken for granted. This is why the seventeenth-
century French courtesan Ninon de Lenclos advised constant feints at with
drawal from one’s lover. “Love never dies of starvation,” she wrote, “but
often of indigestion.”

                                                                                     LAW 16   .
                                                                                                  119
                   The moment you allow yourself to be treated like anyone else, it is too

               late--you are swallowed and digested To prevent this you need to starve
               the other poison of your presence. Force their respect by threatening them
               with the possibility that they will lose you for good; create a pattern of pres-
               ence and absence.

                   Once you die, everything about you will seem different. You will be
               surrounded by an instant aura of respect. People will remember their criti~
               cisms of you, their arguments with you, and will be filled with regret and

               guilt. They are missing a presence that will never return. But you do not
               have to wait until you die: By completely withdrawing for a while, you cre-
               ate a kind of death before death. And when you come back, it will be as if

               you had come back from the dead--an air of resuirection will cling to you,
               and people will be relieved at your return. This is how Deioces made him~
               self king.

                    Napoleon was recognizing the law of absence and presence when he
               said, “If I am often seen at the theater, people will cease to notice me.”
               Today, in a world inundated with presence through the flood of images, the
               game of withdrawal is all the more powerful. We rarely know when to
               withdraw anymore, and nothing seems private, so we are awed by anyone
               who is able to disappear by choice. Novelists J. D. Salinger and Thomas
               Pynchon have created cultlike followings by knowing when to disappear.
                  Another, more everyday side of this law, but one that demonstrates
               its truth even further, is the law of scarcity in the science of economics.

               By withdrawing something from the market, you create instant value. In
               seventeenth-century Holland, the upper classes wanted to make the tulip
               more than just a beautiful flower——they wanted it to be a kind of status sym~
               bol. Making the flower scarce, indeed almost impossible to obtain, they
               sparked what was later called tulipomania. A single flower was now worth
               more than its
                            weight in gold. In our own century, similarly, the art dealer
               Joseph Duveen insisted on making the paintings he sold as scarce and rare
               as
                  possible. To keep their prices elevated and their status high, he bought up
               whole collections and stored them in his basement. The paintings that he
               sold became more than just paintings-—t.hey were fetish objects, their value
               increased by their rarity. “You can get all the pictures you want at fifty thou-
               sand dollars apiece~—-that’s easy,” he once said. “But to get pictures at a
               quarter of a million apiece—that wants doing!”

120   LAW 16
     Extend the law of scarcity to your own skills. Make what you are offer-

ing the world rare and hard to find, and you instantly increase its value.
    There always comes a moment when those in power overstay their
welcome. We have grown tired of them, lost respect for them; we see them
as no different from the rest of mankind, which is to say that we see them as

rather worse, since we inevitably compare their current status in our eyes
to their former one. There is an art to knowing when to retire. If it is done

right, you regain the respect you had lost, and retain a part of your power.
     The greatest ruler of the sixteenth century was Charles V. King of
Spain, Hapsburg emperor, he governed an empire that at one point in-
clucled much of Europe and the New World. Yet at the height of his power,
in 1557, he retired to the monastery of Yuste. All of Europe was captivated

by his sudden withdrawal; people who had hated anti feared him suddenly
called him great, and he came to be seen as a saint. In more recent times,
the film actress Greta Garbo was never more admired than when she re
tired, in 1941, For some her absence came too soon—sl1e was in her mid-
thirties—but she wisely preferred to leave on her own terms, rather than
waiting for her audience to grow tired of her.
    Make yourself too available and the aura of power you have created
around yourself will wear away. Turn the game around: Make yourself less
accessible and you increase the value of your presence.




                                 Authority:
                          Use absence to create

                    respect and esteem. If presence
                  diminishes fame, absence augments it.
                A man who when absent is regarded as a
              lion becomes when present something com-
             mon     and ridiculous. Talents lose their luster
             if we become too familiar with      them, for the
             outer   shell of the mind is   more    readily seen
              than its rich inner kernel. Even the outstand«

              ing genius makes use of retirement so that
                men
                       may honor him and       so    that the
                  yearning aroused by his absence
                     may cause him to be esteemed.

REVERSAL
This law only applies once a certain level of power has been attained. The
need to withdraw only comes after you have established your presence;
leave too early and you do not increase your respect, you are simply for-

gotten. When you are first entering onto the world’: stage, create an image
that is recognizable, reproducible, and is seen everywhere. Until that status
is attained, absence is dangerous—instead of farming the flames, it will ex-

tinguish them.
    In love and seduction, similarly, absence is only effective once you
have surrounded the other with your image, been seen by him or her

everywhere. Everything must remind your lover of your presence, so that
when you do choose to be away, the lover will always be thinking of you,
will always be seeing you in his or her mind’s eye.
     Remember: In the beginning, make yourself not scarce but om-
nipresent. Only what is seen, appreciated, and loved will be missed in its
absence.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In May of 1972, chess champion Boris Spassky anxiously awaited his rival
Bobby Fischer in Reylqavik, Iceland. The two men had been scheduled to
meet for the World Championship of Chess, but Fischer had not arrived on
time and the match was on hold. Fischer had problems with the size of the

prize money, problems with the way the money was to be distributed,
problems with the logistics of holding the match in Iceland. He might back
out at any moment.

     Spassky tried to be patient. His Russian bosses felt that Fischer was hu—
miliating him and told him to walk away, but Spassky wanted this match.
He knew he could destroy Fischer, and nothing was going to spoil the

greatest victory of his career. “So it seems that all our work may come to
nothing,” Spassky told a comrade. “But what can we do? It is Bobby’s
move. If he comes, we
                         play. If he does not come; we do not play. A man
who is willing to commit suicide has the initiative.”
    Fischer finally arrived in Reykjavik, but the problems, and the threat
of cancellation, continued. He disliked the hall where the match was to be
fought, he criticized the lighting, he complained about the noise of the
cameras, he even hated the chairs in which he and Spassky were to sit
Now the Soviet Union took the initiative and threatened to withdraw their
man.

      The bluff apparently worked: After all the weeks of waiting, the end-
less and infuriating negotiations, Fischer agreed to play. Everyone was re-
lieved, no one more than Spassky. But on the day of the ofiicial
introductions, Fischer arrived very late, and on the day when the “Match
of the Century” was to begin, he was late again. This fime, however, the
consequences would be dire: If he showed up too late he would forfeit the
first game. What was going on? Was he playing some sort of mind game?
Or was Bobby Fischer perhaps afraid of Boris Spassky? It seemed to the as-
sembled grand masters, and to Spassky, that this young kid from Brooklyn
had a terrible case of the jitters. At 5:09 Fischer showed up, exactly one
minute before the match was to be canceled.
    The first game of a chess tournament is critical, since it sets the tone for
the months to come. It is often a slow and quiet struggle, with the two play-
ers
    preparing themselves for the war and trying to read each other’s strate-
gies. This game was different. Fischer made a terrible move early on,
perhaps the worst of his career, and when Spassky had him on the ropes,
he seemed to give up. Yet Spassky knew that Fischer never gave up. Even
when facing checkmate, he fought to the bitter end, wearing the opponent
down. This time, though, he seemed resigned. Then suddenly he broke out
a bold move that
                  put the room in a buzz. The move shocked Spassky, but
he recovered and managed to win the game. But no one could figure out
what Fischer was up to. Had he lost deliberately? Or was he rattled? Unset-
tled? Even, as some thought, insane?
     After his defeat in the first game, Fischer complained all the more

loudly about the room, the cameras, and everything else. He also failed to
show up on time for the second game. This time the organizers had had
enough: He was given a forfeit. Now he was down two games to none, at
position from which no one had ever come back to win a chess champi-
onship. Fischer was clearly unhinged. Yet in the third game, as all those
who witnessed it remember, he had a ferocious look in his eye, a look that
clearly bothered Spassky. And despite the hole he had dug for himself, he
seemed supremely confident. He did make what appeared to be another
blunder, as he had in the first game—but his cocky air made Spassky smell
a
  trap. Yet despite the Russian’s suspicions, he could not figure out the trap,
and before he knew it Fischer had checkmated him. In fact Fischer’s un—
orthodox tactics had completely unnerved his opponent. At the end of the

game, Fischer leaped up and rushed out, yelling to his confederates as he
smashed a list into his palm, “I’m crushing him with brute force!”
    In the next games Fischer pulled moves that no one had seen from
him before, moves that were not his style. Now Spassky started to make
blunders. After losing the sixth game, he started to cry. One grand master

said, “After this, Spassky’s got to ask himself if it’s safe to go back to Rus-
sia." After the eighth game Spassky decided he knew what was happening:

Bobby Fischer was hypnotizing him. He decided not to look Fischer in the
eye; he lost anyway.
    After the fourteenth game he called a staff conference and announced,
“An attempt is being made to control my mind.” He wondered whether the

orange juice they drank at the chess table could have been drugged.
Maybe chemicals were being blown into the air. Finally Spassky went pub—
lic, accusing the Fischer team of putting something in the chairs that was a1»
tering Spassky’s mind. The KGB went on alert: Boris Spassky was
embarrassing the Soviet Union!
     The chairs were taken apart and X—rayed. A chemist found nothing
unusual in them. The only things anyone found anywhere, in fact, were
two dead flies in a lighting fixture. Spassky began to complain of hallucina-
tions. He tried to keep playdng, but his mind was unraveling. He could not

go on. On September 2, he resigned. Although still relatively young, he
never recovered from this defeat.




Interpretation
     In previous games between Fischer and Spassky, Fischer had not fared
well. Spassky had an uncanny ability to read his opponent’s strategy and
use it
         against him. Adaptable and patient, he would build attacks that would
defeat not in seven moves but in seventy. He defeated Fischer every time

they played because he saw much further ahead, and because he was a bril-
liant psychologist who never lost control. One master said, “He doesn’t just
look for the best move. He looks for the move that will disturb the man he
is playing.”

    Fischer, however, finally understood that this was one of the keys to
Spassky’s success: He played on your predictability, defeated you at your
own
    game. Everything Fischer did for the championship match was an at-


                                                                                  LAW 17   125
               tempt to put the initiative on his side and to keep Spassl-Ly offibalance.
               Clearly the endless waiting had an effect on Spassky’s psyche. Most power-
               ful of all, though, were Fischer’s deliberate blunders and his appearance of
               having no clear strategy. In fact, he was doing everything he could to
               scramble his old patterns, even if it meant losing the first match and forfeit-
               ing the second.
                     Spassky was known for his sangfroid and levelheadedness, but for the
               first time in his life he could not figure out his opponent. He slowly melted
               down, until at the end he was the one who seemed insane.
                     Chess contains the concentrated essence of life: First, because to win
               you have to be supremely patient and farseeing; and second, because the
               game is built on patterns, whole sequences of moves that have been played
               before and will be played again, with slight alterations, in any one match
               Your opponent analyzes the patterns you are playing and uses them to try
               to foresee your moves. Allowing him nothing             predictable to base his strat-
               egy   on   gives you   a
                                          big advantage. In chess as in life, when people cannot
               figure out what you are doing, they are kept in a state of terror—waiting,
               uncertain, confused,

                 Life at court is a serious, melancholy game of chess, which requires us to draw
                      up our pieces and batteries, form a plan, pursue it, parry that of our
                             adversary. Sometimes, however, it is better to take risks
                                and play the most capricious, unpredictable mave.

                                              lean (1rI.a Bruyéw, I/545-1696



               KEYS TO POWER
               Nothing is more terrifying than the sudden and unpredictable. That is why
               we are so
                         frightened by earthquakes and tornadoes: We do not know when
               they will strike. Alter one has occurred, we wait in terror for the next one.
               To a lesser degree, this is the effect that unpredictable human behavior has
               on us.

                     Animals behave in set patterns, which is why we are able to hunt and
               kill them. Only man has the capacity to consciously alter his behavior, to

               improvise and overcome the weight of routine and habit. Yet most men do
               not realize this power. They prefer the comforts of routine, of giving in to
               the animal nature that has them repeating the same compulsive actions
               time and time again. They do this because it requires no effort, and be-
               cause
                      they mistakenly believe that if they do not unsettle others, they will
               be left alone. Understand: A person of power instills a kind of fear by delib-

               erately unsettling those around him to keep the initiative on his side. You
               sometimes need to strike without waming, to make others tremble when

               they least expect it. It is a device that the powerful have used for centuries.
                   Filippo Maria, the last of the Visconti dukes of Milan in fifteenth»
               century Italy, consciously did the opposite of what everyone expected of
               him. For instance, he might suddenly shower a courtier with attention, and
               then, once the man had come to expect a promotion to higher office,
I26   LAW 17
would suddenly start treating him with the utmost disdain. Confused, the
man          might leave the court, when the duke would suddenly recall him and
start treating him well again. Doubly confused, the courtier would wonder
whether his assumption that he would be promoted had become obvious,
and offensive, to the duke, and would start to behave as if he no longer ex-
pected such honor. The duke would rebuke him for his lack of ambition
and would send him away.
   The secret of dealing with Filippo was simple: Do not presume to
know what he wants. Do not try to guess what will please him. Never inject
your will; just surrender to his will. Then wait to see what happens. Amidst
the confusion and uncertainty he created, the duke ruled supreme, unchal-
lenged and at peace.
     Unpredictability is most often the tactic of the master, but the under-
dog too can use it to great effect. If you find yourself outnumbered or cor-
nered, throw in a series of unpredictable moves. Your enemies will be so
confused that they will pull back or make a tactical blunder.
     In the spring of 1862, during the American Civil War, General
Stonewall Jackson and a force of 4,600 Confederate soldiers were torment»
ing the larger Union forces in the Shenandoah Valley. Meanwhile, not far
away, General George Brinton McClellan, heading a force of 90,000
Union soldiers, was marching south from Washington, D.C., to lay siege to
Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital, As the weeks of the cam-
paign went by, Jackson repeatedly led his soldiers out of the Shenandoah
Valley, then back to it.
     His movements made no sense. Was he preparing to help defend
Richmond? Was he marching on Washington, now that McClellan’s ab-
sence had left it
                  unprotected? Was be heading north to wreak havoc up
there? Why was his small force moving in circles?
    Jacksorfs inexplicable moves made the Union generals delay the
march on Richmond as they waited to figure out what he was up to. Mean-
while, the South was able to pour reinforcements into the town. A battle
that could have crushed the Confederacy turned into a stalemate. Jackson
used this tactic time and again when facing numerically superior forces.
“Always mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy, if possible,” he said,
“.   .
         .   such tactics will win every time and a small army may thus destroy a
large ones”
     This law applies not only to war but to everyday situations. People are
always trying to read the motives behind your actions and to use your pre«
dictability against you. Throw in at completely inexplicable move and you
put them on the defensive. Because they do not understand you, they are
unnerved, and in such a state you can easily intimidate them.
             Pablo Picasso once remarked, “The best calculation is the absence of
calculation. Once you have attained a certain level of recognition, others
generally figure that when you do something, it’ s for an intelligent reason.
So it’s really foolish to plot out your movements too carefully in advance.
You’re better off acting capriciously.”
     For a while, Picasso worked with the ait dealer Paul Rosenberg. At first

                                                                                    LAW 17   127
               he allowed him a fair amount of latitude in handling his paintings, then one
               day, for no apparent reason, he told the man he would no longer give him
               any work to sell. As Picasso explained, “Rosenberg would spend the next
               forty-eight hours trying to figure out why. Was I reserving things for some
               other dealer? I’d go on working and sleeping and Rosenberg would spend
               his time figuring. In two days he’d come back, nerves jangled, anxious, say»
               ing, ‘After all, dear friend, you wouldn’t turn me down if I offered you this
               much [naming a substantially higher figure] for those paintings rather than
                                                                            ”
               the price Pve been accustomed to paying you, would you?’
                   Unpredictability is not only a weapon of terror: Scrambling your pat-
               terns on a day-to-day basis will cause a stir around you and stimulate intet—
               est. People will talk about you, ascribe motives and explanations that have

               nothing to do with the truth, but that keep you constantly in their minds. In
               the end, the more capricious you appear, the more respect you will garner.
               Only the terminally subordinate act in a predictable manner.

REVERSAL
Sometimes predictability can work in your favor: By creating a pattern for
people to be familiar and comfortable with, you can lull them to sleep.
They have prepared everything according to their preconceived notions
about you. You can use this in several ways: First, it sets up a smoke screen,
a   comfortable front behind which you can carry on deceptive actions. Sec
ond, it allows you on rare occasions to do something completely against
the pattern, unsettling your opponent so deeply he will fall to the ground
without being pushed.
      In 1974 Muhammad Ali and George Foreman were scheduled to fight
for the world heavyweight boxing championship. Everyone knew what
would happen: Big George Foreman would try to land a knockout punch
while Ali would dance around him, wearing him out. That was Ali’s way of

fighting, his pattern, and he had not changed it in more than ten years. But
in this case it seemed to give Foreman the advantage: He had a devastating

punch, and if he waited, sooner or later Ali would have to come to him.
Ali, the master strategist, had other plans: In press conferences before the
big fight, he said he was going to change his style and punch it out with
Foreman. No one, least of all Foreman, believed this for a second. That

plan would be suicide on Ali’s part; he was playing the comedian, as usual.
Then, before the fight, Ali’s trainer loosened the ropes around the ring,
something a trainer would do if his boxer were intending to slug it out. But
no one believed this
                       play; it had to be a setup.
     To everyone’s amazement, Ali did exactly what he had said he would
do. As Foreman waited for him to dance around, Ali went right up to him
and slugged it out. He completely upset his opponent’s strategy. At a loss,
Foreman ended up wearing himself out, not by chasing Ali but by throw-

ing punches wildly, and taking more and more counterpunches. Finally,
Ali landed a dramatic right cross that knocked out Foreman. The habit of
assuming that a person’s behavior will fit its previous patterns is so strong
that not even Ali’s announcement of a strategy change was enough to upset
it. Foreman walked into a trap-«the trap he had been told to expect.
     A warning: Unpredictability can work against you sometimes, es

pecially if you are in a subordinate position. There are times when it is bet
ter to let people feel comfortable and settled around you than to disturb

thern. Too much unpredictability will be seen as a sign of indecisiveness, or
even of some more serious
                                psychic problem. Rattems are powerful, and
you   can
           terrify people by disrupting them. Such power should only be
used judiciously.

                     Because humans are social creatures by nature, power depends on so-
                cial interaction and circulation. To make yourself powerful you must place

                yourself at the center of things, as Louis XIV did at Versailles. All activity
                should revolve around you, and you should be aware of everything hap-
                pening on the street, and of anyone who might be hatching plots against
                you. The danger for most people comes when they feel threatened. In such
                times they tend to retreat and close ranks, to find security in a kind of
                fortress. In doing so, however, they come to rely for information on a
                smaller and smaller circle, and lose perspective on events around them.
                They lose maneuverability and become easy targets, and their isolation
                makes them paranoid. As in warfare and most games of strategy, isolation
                often precedes defeat and death.
                     In moments of uncertainty and danger, you need to fight this desire to
                turn inward. Instead, make yourself more accessible, seek out old allies and

                make new ones, force yourself into more and more different circles. This
                has been the trick of powerful people for centuries.
                     The Roman statesman Cicero was born into the lower nobility, and
                had little chance of power unless he managed to make a place for himself

                among the aristocrats who controlled the city. He succeeded brilliantly,
                identifying everyone with influence and figuring out how they were con-
                nected to one another. He mingled everywhere, knew everyone, and had
                such a vast network of connections that an enemy here could easily be
                counterbalanced by an ally there,
                     The French statesman Talleyrand played the game the same way. Al-
                though he came from one of the oldest aristocratic families in France, he
                made a point of always staying in touch with what was happening in the
                streets of Paris, allowing him to foresee trends and troubles. He even got a
                certain pleasure out of mingling with shady criminal types, who supplied
                him with valuable information. Every time there was a crisis, a transition of
                power--the end of the Directory, the fall of Napoleon, the abdication of
                Louis XVIII-~he was able to survive and even thrive, because he never
                closed himself up in a small circle but always forged connections with the
                new order.

                        This law pertains to kings and queens, and to those of the highest
                power: The moment you lose contact with your people, seeking security in
                isolation, rebellion is brewing. Never imagine yourself so elevated that you
                can     afford to cut yourself off from even the lowest echelons. By retreating
                to a fortress, you make yourself an easy target for your plotting subjects,
                who view your isolation as an insult and a reason for rebellion.
                     Since humans are such social creatures, it follows that the social arts
                that make us pleasant to be around can be practiced only by constant ex-
                posure and circulation. The more you are in contact with others, the more
                graceful and at ease you become. Isolation, on the other hand, engenders
                an awkwardness in
                                       your gestures, and leads to further isolation, as people
                start    avoidmg you.
                        In 1545 Duke Cosimo I de’ Medici decided that to ensure the immor-


l 34   LAW 18
tality of his name he would commission frescoes for the main chapel of the
church of San Lorenzo in Florence. He had many great painters to choose
from, and in the end he picked jacopo da Pontonno. Getting on in years,
Pontormo wanted to make these frescoes his chef d’oeuvre and legacy. His
first decision was to close the chapel off with walls, partitions, and blinds.
He wanted no one to witness the creation of his masterpiece, or to steal his
ideas. He would outdo Michelangelo himself. When some young men
broke into the chapel out of curiosity, jacopo sealed it off even further.
    Pontormo filled the chape1’s ceiling with biblical scenes—the Creation,
Adam and Eve, Noah's ark, on and on. At the top of the middle will he
painted Christ in his majesty, raising the dead onjudgment Day. The artist
worked on the chapel for eleven years, rarely leaving it, since he had de—
veloped a phobia for human contact and was afraid his ideas would be
stolen.
    Ponrormo died before completing the frescoes, and none of them has
survived. But the great Renaissance writer Vasari, a friend of Pontormds
who saw the frescoes shortly after the artist’s death, left a description of
what they looked like. There      was   a   total lack of proportion. Scenes
bumped against scenes, figures in one story being juxtaposed with those in
another, in maddening numbers. Pontormo had become obsessed with de»
tall but had lost any sense of the overall composition. Vasari left off his de~
scription of the frescoes by writing that if he continued, “I think I would go
mad and become entangled in this painting, just as I believe that in the
eleven years of time jacopo spent on it, he entangled himself and anyone
else who saw it.” Instead of crowning Pontormo’s career, the work became
his undoing.
    These frescoes were visual equivalents of the effects of isolation on the
human mind: a loss of proportion, an obsession with detail combined with
an inability to see the
                        larger picture, a kind of extravagant ugliness that no
longer communicates. Clearly, isolation is as deadly for the creative arts as
for the social arts. Shakespeare is the most famous writer in history be-
cause, as a dramatist for the popular stage, he opened himself up to the
masses, making his work accessible to people no matter what their educa-
tion and taste. Artists who hole themselves up in their fortress lose a sense
of proportion, their work communicating only to their small circle. Such
art remains cornered and   powerless.
    Finally, since power is a human creation, it is inevitably increased by
Contact with other people. Instead of falling into the fortress mentality,
view the world in the following manner: It is like a vast Versailles, with

every room communicating with another. You need to be permeable, able
to float in and out of different circles and mix with different types. That

kind of mobility and social contact will protect you from plotters, who will
be unable to keep secrets from you, and from your enemies, who will be
unable to isolate you from your allies. Always on the move, you mix and
mingle in the rooms of the palace, never sitting or settling in one place. No
hunter can fix his aim on such a svvifbmoving creature.

                    place their reliance upon the good will of their subjects, and not
                    upon the strength of citadels. {Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-4527)



                REVE RSAL
                It is hardly ever right and propitious to choose isolation. Without keeping
                an ear on  what is happening in the streets, you will be unable to protect

                yourself. About the only thing that constant human contact cannot facili~
                tate is thought. The weight of society's pressure to conform, and the lack of
                distance from other people, can make it impossible to think clearly about
                what is going on around you. As a temporary recourse, then, isolation can

                help you to gain perspective. Many a serious thinker has been produced in
                prisons, where we have nothing to do but think. Machiavelli could write
                The Prince only once he found himself in exile and isolated on a farm far
                from the political intrigues of Florence.
                     The danger is, however, that this kind of isolation will sire all kinds of
                strange and perverted ideas. You may gain perspective on the larger pic-
                ture, but you lose a sense of your own smallness and limitations. Also, the
                more isolated you are, the harder it is to break out of your isolation when

                you choose to——it sinks you deep into its quicksand without your noticing.
                If you need time to think, then, choose isolation only as a last resort, and
                only in small doses. Be careful to keep your way back into society open.

tion. They learn their lesson, recognizing that there is no such thing as a
free lunch, and that they have usually been brought down by their own

greed for easy money. Some, however, refuse to take their medicine. In
stead of reflecting on their own gullibility and avarice, they see themselves
as totally innocent victims.

     Men like this may seem to be crusaders for justice and honesty, but

they are actually immoderately insecure. Being fooled, being conned, has
activated their self-doubt, and they are desperate to repair the damage.
Were the mortgage on N0rfleet’s ranch, the collapse of his marriage, and
the years of borrowing money and living in cheap hotels worth his revenge
over his embarrassment at
                              being fleeced? To the Norfleets of the world,
overcoming their embarrassment is worth any price.
    All people have insecurities, and often the best way to deceive a sucker
is to play upon his insecurities. But in the realm of power, everything is a

question of degree, and the person who is decidedly more insecure than
the average mortal presents great dangers. Be warned: If you practice de~

ception or trickery of any sort, study your mark well. Some people’s inse-
curity and ego fragility cannot tolerate the slightest offense. To see if you
are
    dealing with such a type, test them first—make, say, a mild joke at their
expense. A confident person will laugh; an overly insecure one will react as
if personally insulted. If you suspect you are dealing with this type, find an-
other victim.


Transgression III
In the fifth century B.C., Ch’ung-erh, the prince of Ch’in (in present-day
China), had been forced into exile. He lived modestly——even, sometimes,
in poverty—waiting for the time when he could return home and resume
his princely life. Once he was passing through the state of Cheng, where
the ruler, not knowing who he was, treated him rudely. The r1.1ler’s minis-
ter, Shu Chan, saw this and said, “This man is a worthy prince. May Your
Highness treat him with great courtesy and thereby place him under an
obligation!” But the ruler, able to see only the prince’s lowly station, ig-
nored this advice and insulted the prince again. Shu Chan again warned
his master, saying, “If Your Highness cannot treat Ch’ung~erh with cour-
tesy, you should put him to death, to avoid calamity in the future.” The
ruler only scoffed.
    Years later, the prince was finally able to return home, his circum-
stances   greatly changed. He did not forget who had been kind to him, and

                                                                                  LAW 19   I41
                   who had been insolent, during his years of poverty. Least of all did he for»
                   get his treatment at the hands of the ruler of Cheng. At his first opportunity
                   he assembled a vast army and marched on Chang, taking eight cities, de~
                   straying the kingdom, and sending the ruler into an exile of his own.
                   Interpretation
                   You can never be sure who you are dealing with. A man who is of little im-
                   portance and means today can be a person of power tomorrow. We forget
                   a lot in our   lives, but we rarely forget an insult.
                       How was the ruler of Cheng to know that Prince Ch’ung-erh was an
                   ambitious, calculating, cunning type, a serpent with along memory? There
                   was
                       really no way for him to know, you may say-—but since there was no
                   way, it would have been better not to tempt the fates by finding out. There
                   is nothing to be gained by insulting a person unnecessarily      Swallow the
                   impulse   to offend, even if the other person seems weak. The satisfaction is

                   meager compared to the danger that someday be or she will be in a posi
                   tion to hurt you.


                   Transgresskm IV
                   The year of 1920 had been a particularly bad one for American art dealers.
                   Big buyers«-«the robber-baron generation of the previous century-~were
                   getting to an age where they were dying off like flies, and no new million»
                   aires had emerged to take their place. Things were so bad that a number of
                   the major dealers decided to pool their resources, an unheard-of event,
                   since art dealers usually get along like cats and dogs.

                        Joseph Duveen, art dealer to the richest tycoons of America, was suf-
                   fering more than the others that year, so he decided to go along with this
                   alliance. The group now consisted of the five biggest dealers in the country.
                   Looking around for a new client, they decided that their last best hope was
                   Henry Ford, then the wealthiest man in America. Ford had yet to venture
                   into the art market, and he was such a big target that it made sense for them
                   to work   together.
                       The dealers decided to assemble a list, “The 100 Greatest Paintings in
                   the World” (all of which they happened to have in stock), and to offer the
                   lot of them to Ford. With one purchase he could make himself the world’s
                   greatest collector. The consortium worked for weeks to produce a magnifi-
                   cent object: a three-volume set of books containing beautiful reproductions
                   of the paintings, as well as scholarly texts accompanying each picture. Next
                   they made a personal visit to Ford at his home in Dearborn, Michigan.
                   There they were surprised by the simplicity of his house: Mr. Ford was ob‘
                   viously an extremely unaffected man.
                        Ford received them in his study. Looking through the book, he ex-
                   pressed astonishment and delight. The excited dealers began imagining the
                   millions of dollars that would shortly flow into their coflers. Finally, how—
                   ever, Ford looked up from the book and said, “Gentlemen, beautiful books
                   like these, with beautiful colored pictures like these, must cost an awful
                   lot!” “But Mr. Ford!” exclaimed Duveen, “we don’t expect you to buy these


142   j   LAW 19
books. We got them up especially for you, to show you the pictures. These
books are a present to you.” Ford seemed puzzled. “Gentlemen,” he said,
“it is extremely nice of you, but I really don’t see how I can accept a beau-
tiful, expensive present like this from strangers.” Duveen explained to Ford
that the reproductions in the books showed paintings they had hoped to
sell to him. Ford finally understood. “But gentlemen,” he exclaimed, “what
would I want with the original pictures when the ones right here in these
books are so beautiful?”
Interpretation
Joseph Duveen prided himself on studying his victims and clients in ad
Vance, figuring out their weaknesses and the peculiarities of their tastes be
fore he ever met them. He was driven by desperation to drop this tactic just
once, in his assault on Henry Ford. It took him months to recover from his

misjudgrnent, both mentally and monetarily. Ford was the unassuming
plain—ma.n type who just isn’t worth the bother. He was the incarnation of
those literal-minded folk who do not possess enough imagination to be de
ceived. From then on, Duveen saved his energies for the Mellons and Mor-

gans of the world——men crafty enough for him to entrap in his snares.



KEYS T() POWER
The ability to measure people and to know who you’re dealing with is the
most important skill of all in   gathering and conserving power. Without it
you are blind: Not only will you offend the wrong people, you will choose
the Wrong types to work on, and will think you are flattering people when
you are actually insulting them. Before embarking on any move, take the
measure  of your mark or potential opponent. Otherwise you will waste
time and make mistakes.    Study people's weaknesses, the chinks in their
armor, their areas of both pride and insecurity. Know their ins and outs be-
fore you even decide whether or not to deal with them.
     Two final words of caution: First, in judging and measuring your oppo~
nent, never rely on your instincts. You will make the greatest mistakes of all
if you rely on such inexact indicators. Nothing can substitute for gathering
concrete   knowledge. Study and spy on your opponent for however long it
takes; this will pay off in the long run.
    Second, never trust appearances. Anyone with a serpent’s heart can
use a show of kindness to cloakit; a person who is blustery on the outside is
often really a coward. Learn to see through appearances and their contra-
dictions. Never trust the version that people give of themselves——it is ut-

terly unreliable.

                  OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
                  When Queen Elizabeth I ascended the throne of England, in 1558, there
                  was much to-do about her
                                             finding a husband. The issue was debated in Par-
                  liament, and was a. main topic of conversation among Englishmen of all
                  classes; they often disagreed as to whom she should marry, but everyone
                  thought she should marry as soon as possible, for a queen must have a
                  king, and must bear heirs for the kingdom. The debates raged on for years.
                  Meanwhile the most handsome and eligible bachelors in the realm-Sir
                  Robert Dudley, the Earl of Essex, Sir Walter Ra.leigh———vied for Elizabetlfs
                  hand. She did not discourage them, but she seemed to be in no hurry, and
                  her hints as to which man might be her favorite often contradicted each
                  other. In 1566, Parliament sent a delegation to Elizabeth urging her to
                  marry before she was too old to bear children. She did not argue, nor did
                  she discourage the delegation, but she remained a virgin nonetheless.
                      The delicate game that Elizabeth played with her suitors slowly made
                  her the subject of innumerable sexual fantasies and the object of cultish
                  worship. The court physician, Simon Forman, used his diary to describe
                  his dreams of deflowering her. Painters represented her as Diana and other

                  goddesses. The poet Edmund Spenser and others wrote eulogies to the Vir-
                  gin Queen. She was referred to as “tha, wor1d’s Empresse,” “that virtuous
                  Virgo” who rules the world and sets the stars in motion. In conversation
                  with her, her many male suitors would employ bold sexual innuendo, a
                  dare that Elizabeth did not discourage. She did all she could to stir their in
                  terest and simultaneously keep them at bay.

                       Throughout Europe, kings and princes knew that a marriage with Eliz-
                  abeth would seal an alliance between England and any nation. The king of

                  Spain wooed her, as did the prince of Sweden and the archduke of Austria.
                  She politely refused them all.
                       The great diplomatic issue of Elizabetlfs day was posed by the revolt
                  of the Flemish and Dutch Lowlands, which were then possessions of Spain.
                  Should England break its alliance with Spain and choose France as its main
                  ally on the Continent, thereby encouraging Flemish and Dutch indepen-
                  dence? By 1570 it had come to seem that an alliance with France would be
                  England’s wisest course. France had two eligible men of noble blood, the
                  dukes of Anjou and Alencon, brothers of the French king. Would either of
                  them marry Elizabeth? Both had advantages, and Elizabeth kept the hopes
                  of both alive. The issue simmered for years. The duke of Anjou made sev-
     ?
M6       LAW 20
eral visits to England, kissed Elizabeth in public, even called her by pet
names; she    appeared to requite his affections. Meanwhile, as she flirted
with the two brothers,     a
                               treaty was signed that sealed peace between
France and     England. By 1582 Elizabeth felt she could break off the
courtship. In the case of the duke of Anjou in particular, she did so with
great relief: For the sake of diplomacy she had allowed herself to be
courted by a man whose presence she could not stand and whom she
found physically repulsive. Once peace between France and England was
secure, she   dropped the unctuous duke as politely as she could.
    By this time Elizabeth was too old to bear children. She was accord-
ingly able to live the rest of her life as she desired, and she died the Virgin
Queen. She left no direct heir, but ruled through a period of incomparable
peace and cultural fertility.
                                                                         “




Interpretation
Elizabeth had good reason not to marry: She had witnessed the mistakes of
Mary Queen of Scots, her cousin. Resisting the idea of being ruled by a
woman, the Scots expected Mary to many and marry wisely. To wed a for-

eigner would be unpopular; to favor any particular noble house would
open up terrible rivalries. In the end Mary chose Lord Damley, a Catholic.
In doing so she incurred the wrath of Scotland’s Protestants, and endless
turmoil ensued.
    Elizabeth knew that marriage can often lead to a female ru1er’s undo-
ing: By marrying and committing to an alliance with one party or nation,
the queen becomes embroiled in conflicts that are not of her choosing, con~
flicts which may eventually overwhelm her or lead her into a futile war.
Also, the husband becomes the de facto ruler, and often tries to do away
with his wife the queen, as Darnley tried to get rid of Mary. Elizabeth
learned the lesson well. She had two goals as a ruler: to a‘ ‘old marriage and
to avoid war. She managed to combine these goals                by Lnngling the possi-
bility of marriage in order to forge alliances. The moment she committed
to any single suitor would have been the moment she lost her power. She
had to emanate mystery and           desirability, never discouraging anyone’s
hopes but never yielding.
     Through this lifelong game of flirting and withdrawing, Elizabeth
dominated the country and every man who sought to conquer her. As the
center of attention, she was in control. Keeping her independence above

all, Elizabeth protected her power and made herself an object of worship.

KEYS 'l‘(..) POWER
Since power depends greatly on appearances, you must learn the tricks
that will enhance your image. Refusing to commit to a person or group is
one of these, When you     hold yourself back, you incur not anger but a kind

                                                                                         LAW 20   §   147
               of respect. You instantly seem powerful because you make yourself un-

               graspable, rather than succumbing to the group, or to the relationship, as
               most people do. This aura of power
                                                  only grows with time: As your reputa-
               tion for independence grows, more and more people will come to desire

               you, wanting to be the one who gets you to commit. Desire is like a virus: If
               we see that someone is desired
                                              by other people, we tend to find this person
               desirable too.
                     The moment you commit, the magic is gone. You become like every-
               one   else. People will try all kinds of underhanded methods to get you to
               commit. They will give you gifts, shower you with favors, all to put you
               under obligation. Encourage the attention, stimulate their interest, but do
               not commit at any cost. Accept the gifts and favors if you so desire, but be
               careful to maintain your inner aloofness, You cannot inadvertently allow
               yourself to feel obligated to anyone.
                     Remember, though: The goal is not to put people off, or to make it seem
               that you are incapable of commitment. Like the Virgin Queen, you need to
               stir the pot, excite interest, lure people with the possibility of having you.
               You have to bend to their attention occasionally, then——but never too far:
                     The Greek soldier and statesman Alcibiades played this game to per-
               fection. It was Alcibiades who inspired and led the massive Athenian at-
               mada that invaded Sicily in 414 BC. When envious Athenians back home
               tried to bring him down by accusing him of trumpedup charges, he de-
               fected to the enemy, the Spartans, instead of facing a trial back home. Then,
               after the Athenians were defeated at Syracuse, he left Sparta for Persia, even

               though the power of Sparta was now on the rise. Now, however, both the
               Athenians and the Spartans courted Alcibiades because of his influence
               with the Persians; and the Pen tans showered him with honors because of
               his power over the Athenians and the Spartans. He made promises to every
               side but committed to none, and in the end he held all the cards.
                     If you aspire to power and influence, try the Alcibiades tactic: Put

               yourself in the middle between competing powers. Lure one side with the
               promise of your help; the other side, always wanting to outdo its enemy,
               will pursue you as well. As each side vies for your attention, you will im-
               mediately seem a person of great influence and desirability. More power
               will accrue to you than if you had rashly committed to one side. To perfect
               this tactic you need to keep yourself inwardly free from emotional entan-
               glements, and to view all those around you as pawns in your rise to the top.
               You cannot let yourself become the lackey for any cause.
                    In the midst of the 1968 U.S. presidential election, Henry Kissinger
               made a phone call to Richard Nixon’s team. Kissinger had been allied with
               Nelson Rockefeller, who had unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomina-
               tion. Now Kissinger offered to supply the Nixon camp with valuable inside
               information on the negotiations for peace in Vietnam that were then going
               on in Paris.   He had a man on the negotiating team keeping him informed of
               the latest developments. The Nixon team gladly accepted his offer.
                     At the same time, however, Kissinger also approached the Democratic
               nominee, Hubert Humphrey, and offered his aid. The Humphrey people
148   LAW 20
asked him for inside information on Nixon and he supplied it. “Look,”
Kissinger told Hurnphrey’s people, “I’ve hated Nixon for years.” In fact he
had no interest in either side. What he really wanted was what he got: the

promise of a high-level cabinet post from both Nixon and Humphrey.
Whichever man won the election, Kissingefs career was secure.
   The winner, of course, was Nixon, and Kissinger duly went on to his
cabinet post. Even so, he was careful never to appear too much of a Nixon
man.   When Nixon was reelected in 1972, men much more loyal to him
than Kissinger were fired. Kissinger was also the only Nixon high official to
survive Watergate and serve under the next president, Gerald Ford. By

maintaining a little distance he thrived in turbulent times.
    Those who use this strategy often notice a strange phenomenon:

People who rush to the support of others tend to gain little respect in the
process, for their help is so easily obtained, while those who stand back
find themselves besieged with supplicants. Their aloofness is powerful, and

everyone wants them on their side.
    When Picasso, after early years of poverty, had become the most suc-
cessful aitist in the world, he did not commit himself to this dealer or that
dealer, although they now besieged him from all sides with attractive offers
and grand promises. Instead, he appeared to have no interest in their ser-
vices; this technique drove them wild, and as they fought over him his
prices only rose. When Henry Kissinger, as U.S. secretary of state, wanted
to reach détente with the Soviet Union, he made no concessions or concil-

iatory gestures, but courted China instead. This infuriated and also scared
the Soviets——-they were already politically isolated and feared further isola
tion if the United States and China, ,ca.me together. Kissinger’s move

pushed them to the negotiating table. The tactic has a parallel in seduction:
When you want to seduce a woman, Stendhal advises, court her sister first.
    Stay aloof and people will come to you. It will become a challenge for
them to win your affections. As long as you imitate the wise Virgin Queen
and stimulate their hopes, you will remain a magnet of attention and desire.

When Isabella had a child, she asked Cesare to be the godfather. She even
dangled in front of him the possibility of a marriage between her family
and his. Somehow it all worked, for although elsewhere he seized every-
thing in his path, he spared Mantua.
    In 1503 Cesare’s father, Alexander, died, and a few years later the new

pope, Julius II, went to war to drive the French troops from Italy. When
the ruler of Fe1rara——Alfonso, Isabella’s brother—sided with the French,

Julius decided to attack and humble him. Once again Isabella found herself
in the middle: the pope on one side, the French and her brother on the
other. She dared not ally herself with either, but to offend either would be
equally disastrous. Again she played the double game at which she had be-
come so
         expert. On the one hand she got her husband Gonzaga to fight for
the pope, knowing he would not fight very hard. On the other she let
French troops pass through Mantua to come to Ferrara’s aid. While she

publicly complained that the French had “invaded” her territory, she pri-
vately supplied them with valuable information. To make the invasion
plausible to Julius, she even had the French pretend to plunder Mantua. It
worked once again: The pope left Mantua alone.
    In 1513, after a lengthy siege, Julius defeated Ferrara, and the French

troops withdrew. Worn out by the effort, the pope died a few months later.
With his death, the nightmarish cycle of battles and petty squabbles began
to repeat itself.

If you keep your growing number of suitors waiting too long, you will in-

spire not desire but distrust. People will start to lose interest. Eventually
you may find it worthwhile to commit to one sidevwif only for appearances’
sake, to prove you are capable of attachment.
     Even then, however, the key will be to maintain your inner indepen-
dence-—to keep yourself from getting emotionally involved. Preserve the
unspoken option of being able to leave at any moment and reclaim your
freedom if the side you are allied with starts to collapse. The friends you
made while you were being courted will give you plenty of places to go
once you jump ship.

                                        signing the rights to the site over to the financiers, and leaving maps to it.
                                            News of the mine spread like wildfire. Prospectors fanned out across

                                        Wyoming. Meanwhile Harpending and group began spending the millions

                                            A few weeks later, on their first trip back to the site, they learned the
                                        hard truth: Not a single diamond or ruby was to be found. It was all a fake.
                                        They were mined. Harpending had unwittingly lured the richest men in
                                        the world into the biggest scam of the century.

                                        The prospectors had simply observed the law of appearing more stupid

   The logistics of the con were quite simple. Months before Arnold and
Slack announced the “discovery” of the diamond mine, they traveled to
Europe, where they purchased some real gems for around $12,000 (part of
the money they had saved from their days as gold miners). They then
salted the “mine” with these gems, which the first expert dug up and
brought to San Francisco. The jewelers who had appraised these stones, in»
cluding Tiffany himself, had gotten caught up in the fever and had grossly
overestimated their value. Then Ralston gave the prospectors $l00,000 as
security, and immediately after their trip to New York they simply went to
Amsterdam, where they bought sacks of uncut gems, before ramming to
San Francisco. The second time they salted the mine, there were many
more jewels to be found.

   The effectiveness of the scheme, however, rested not on tricks like
these but on the fact that Arnold and Slack played their parts to perfection.
On their trip to New York, where they mingled with millionaires and ty—
coons, they played up their clodhopper image, wearing pants and coats a
size or two too small and acting incredulous at everything they saw in the

big city. No one believed that these country simpletons could possibly be
conning the most devious, unscrupulous financiers of the time. And once
Harpending, Ralston, and even Rothschild accepted the mine’s existence,
anyone who doubted it was questioning the intelligence of the world’s most
successful businessmen.
    In the end, Harpending’s reputation was mined and he never recov-
ered; Rothschild learned his lesson and never fell for another con; Slack
took his money and disappeared from view, never to be found. Arnold
simply went home to Kentucky. After all, his sale of his mining rights had
been legitimate; the buyers had taken the best advice, and if the mine had
run out of diamonds, that was their problem. Arnold used the money to

greatly enlarge his farm and open up a bank of his own.


KEYS TO POWER
The feeling that someone else is more intelligent than we are is almost in-
tolerable. We usually try to justify it in difierent ways: “He only has book
knowledge, whereas I have real knowledge.” “Her parents paid for her to
get a good education. If my parents had had as much money, if I had been
as privileged..   .  .” “He’s not as smart as he thinks.” Last but not least: “She
      know    her  narrow little field better than I do, but
may                                                          beyond that she’s re-
                      all. Even Einstein was a boob outside
ally not  smart   at                                         physics.”
      Given how important the idea of intelligence is to most people’s van-
ity, it is critical never inadvertently to insult or impugn a person’s brain
power. That is an unforgivable sin. But if you can make this iron rule work
for you, it opens up all sorts of avenues of deception. Sublirninally reassure
people that they are more intelligent than you are, or even that you are a
bit of a moron, and you can run rings around them. The feeling of intellee
tual superiority you give them will disarm their suspiciorrmuscles.
    In 1865 the Prussian councillor Otto von Bismarck wanted Austria to

                                                                                     LAW 21   ;   I59
                   sign a certain treaty. The treaty was totally in the interests of Prussia and
                   against the interests of Austria, and Bismarck would have to strategize to
                   get the Ausmans to agree to it But the Austrian negotiator, Count Blorne,
                   was an avid
                                cardplayer. His particular game was quinze, and he often said
                   that he could judge a man’s character by the way he played quinze. Bis-
                   marck knew of this saying of Blome’s.
                        The night before the negotiations were to begin, Bismarck innocently
                   engaged Blome in a game of quinze. The Prussian would later write, “That
                   was the
                             very last time I ever played quinze. I played so recklessly that
                   everyone was astonished. I lost several thousand talers [the currency of the
                   time], but I succeeded in fooling [Blome], for he believed me to be more
                   venturesome than I am and I gave way.” Besides appearing reckless, Bis-
                   marck also played the witless fool, saying ridiculous things and bumbling
                   about with a surplus of nervous energy.
                        All this made Blome feel he had gadiered valuable information. He
                   knew that Bismarck was aggressive———the Prussian already had that reputa-
                   tion, and the way he played had confirmed it. And aggressive men, Blome
                   knew, can be foolish and rash. Accordingly, when the time came to Sign
                   the treaty, Blome thought he had the advantage. A heedless fool like Bis-
                   marck, he thought, is incapable of cold—blooded calculation and deception,
                   so he
                          only glanced at the treaty before signing it—he failed to read the fine
                   print. As soon as the ink was dry, a joyous Bismarck exclaimed in his face,
                   “Well, I could never have believed that I should find an Austrian diplomat
                   willing to sign that document!”
                        The Chinese have a phrase, “Masqueracling as a swine to kill the
                   tiger.” This refers to an ancient hunting technique in which the hunter
                   clothes himself in the hide and snout of a pig, and mimics its grunting. The
                   mighty tiger thinks a pig is coming his way, and lets it get close, savoring
                   the prospect of an easy meal. But it is the hunter who has the last laugh.
                        Masquerading as a swine works wonders on those who, like tigers, are
                   arrogant and overconfident: The easier they think it is to prey on you, the
                   more
                          easily you can turn the tables. This trick is also useful if you are ambi-
                   tious yet find yourself low in the hierarchy: Appearing less intelligent than

                   you are, even a bit of a fool, is the perfect disguise. Look like a harmless pig
                   and no one will believe you harbor dangerous ambitions. They may even
                   promote you since you seem so likable, and subservient. Claudius before
                   he became emperor of Rome, and the prince of France who later became
                   Louis XIII, used this tactic when those above them suspected they might
                   have designs on the throne. By playing the fool as young men, they were
                   left alone. When the time came for them to strike, and to act with vigor and
                   decisiveness, they caught everyone oi?-guard.
                       Intelligence is the obvious quality to downplay, but why stop there?
                   Taste and sophistication rank close to intelligence on the vanity scale;
                   make people feel they are more sophisticated than you are and their guard
                   will come down. As Arnold and Slack knew, an air of complete naiveté can
                   work wonders. Those fancy financiers were laughing at them behind their


I60   3   LAW 2]
backs, but who laughed loudest in the end? In general, then, always make
people believe they are smarter and more sophisticated than you are. They
will keep you around because you make them feel better about themselves,
and the longer you are around, the more opportunities you will have to do
ceive them.

REVE RS A14
To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays; you should get in
the habit of downplaying it at all times. If people inadvertently learn the
truth—-that you are actually much smarter than you look--«they will admire
you more for being discreet than for making your brilliance show. At the
start of your climb to the top, of course, you cannot play too stupid: You

may want to let your bosses know, in a subtle way, that you are smarter
than the competition around you. As you climb the ladder, however, you
should to some degree try to dampen your brilliance.
    There is, however, one situation where it pays to do the opposite-
when you can cover up a deception with a show of intelligence. In matters
of smarts as in most things, appearances are what count. If you seem to
have authority and knowledge, people will believe what you say. This can
be very useful in getting you out of a scrape.
    The art dealer Joseph Duveen was once attending a soirée at the New
York home of a tycoon to whom he had recently sold a Diirer painting for


                                                                                LAW 21   I51

                  high price. Among the guests was a young French art critic who seemed
                extremely knowledgeable and confident. Wanting to impress this man, the
                tyeoon’s daughter showed him the Diirer, which had not yet been hung.
                The critic studied it for a time, then finally said, “You know, I don’t think
                this Diirer is right.” He followed the young woman as she hurried to tell
                her father what he had said, and listened as the magnate, deeply unsettled,
                turned to Duveen for reassurance. Duveen just laughed. “How very amus-

                ing,” he said. “Do you realize, young man, that at least twenty other art ex-
                perts here and in Europe have been taken in too, and have said that
                painting isn’t genuine? And now you’ve made the same mistake.” His con-
                fident tone and air of authority intimidated the Frenchman, who apolo-
                gized for his mistake.
                    Duveen knew that the art market was flooded with fakes, and that

                many paintings had been falsely ascribed to old masters. He tried his best
                to distinguish the real from the fake, but in his zeal to sell he often over-

                played a work’s authenticity. What mattered to him was that the buyer be-
                lieved he had bought a Diii-er, and that Duveen himself convinced

                everyone of his “expertness” through his air of irreproachable authority,
                Thus, it is important to be able to play the professor when necessary and
                never   impose such an attitude for its own sake.

his beliefs, as well as fellow German intellectuals who had lied Hitler. In
1941, accordingly, Brecht emigrated to the United States, and chose to set-
tle in Los Angeles, where he hoped to make a living in the film business.
    Over the next few years Brecht wrote screenplays with a pointedly an—
ticapitalist slant. He had little success in Hollywood, so in 1947, the war
having ended, he decided to return to Europe. That same year, however,
the US. Cong;ress’s House Un—American Activities Committee began its
investigation into supposed Communist infiltration in Hollywood. It began
to gather information on Brecht, who had so openly espoused Marxism,
and on September 19, 1947, only a month before he had planned to leave
the United States, he received a subpoena to appear before the committee.
In addition to Brecht, a number of other writers, producers, and directors
were summoned to appear as       well, and this group came to be known as the
Hollywood 19.
      Before going to Washington, the Hollywood 19 met to decide on a plan
of action. Their approach would be confrontational. Instead of answering
questions about their membership, or lack of it, in the Communist Party,
they would read prepared statements that would challenge the authority of
the committee and argue that its activities were unconstitutional. Even if
this strategy meant imprisonment, it would gain publicity for their cause.
      Brecht disagreed. What good was it, he asked, to play the martyr and
gain a little public sympathy if in the process they lost the ability to stage
their plays and sell their scripts for years to come? He felt certain they were


                                                                                             LAW 22              I65
               all more intelligent than the members of the committee. Why lower them-
               selves to the level of their opponents by arguing with them? Why not out
               fox the committee by appearing to surrender to it while subtly mocking it?
               The Hollywood 19 listened to Brecht politely, but decided to stick to their

               plan, leaving Brecht to go his own way.
                    The committee finally summoned Brecht on October 30. They ex-
               pected him to do what others among the Hollywood 19 who had testified
               before him had done: Argue, refuse to answer questions, challenge the
               committee's right to hold its hearing, even yell and hurl insults. Much to
               their surprise, however, Brecht was the very picture of Congeniality. He
               wore a suit
                            (something he rarely did), smoked a cigar (he had heard that
               the committee chairman was a passionate cigar smoker), answered their
               questions politely, and generally deferred to their authority.
                   Unlike the other witnesses, Brecht answered the question of whether
               he belonged to the Communist Party: He was not a member, he said,
               which happened to be the truth. One committee member asked him, “is it
               true you have written a number of revolutionary plays?” Brecht had writ-
               ten many plays with overt Communist messages, but he responded, “I
               have written a number of poems and songs and plays in the fight against
               Hitler and, of course, they can be considered, therefore, as revolutionary
               because I, of course, was for the overthrow of that government.” This state
               ment went   unchallenged.
                     Brecht’s English was more than adequate, but he used an interpreter
               throughout his testimony, a tactic that allowed him to play subtle games
               with language. When committee members found Communist leanings in
               lines from English editions of his poems, he would repeat the lines in Ger
               man   for the interpreter, who would then retranslate them; and somehow
               they would come out innocuous. At one point a committee member read
               one of Brechfs
                              revolutionary poems out loud in English, and asked him if
               he had written it. “No,” he responded, “I wrote a German poem, which is
               very different from this.” The author's elusive answers baffled the commit-
               tee members, but his politeness and the way he yielded to their authority
               made it impossible for them to get angry with him.
                     After only an hour of questioning, the committee members had had
               enough. “Thank you very much,” said the chairman, “You are a good ex-
               ample to the {other} witnesses.” Not only did they free him, they offered to
               help him if he had any trouble with immigration oficials who might detain
               him for their own reasons. The following day, Brecht left the United States,
               never to return.




               Interpretation
               The Hollywood 19’s confrontational approach won them a lot of sympa~
               thy, and years later they gained a kind of vindication in public opinion. But
               they were also blacklisted, and lost valuable years of profitable working
               time. Brecht, on the other hand, expressed his disgust at the committee
               more
                     indirectly. It was not that he changed his beliefs or compromised his
               values; instead, during his short testimony, he kept the upper hand by ap-
166   LAW 22
pearing to yield while all the time running circles around the committee
with vague responses, outright lies that went unchallenged because they
were wrapped in enigmas, and word games. In the end he kept the free-

dom to continue his revolutionary writing (as opposed to suffering impris
onment or detainment in the United States), even while subtly mocking the
committee and its authority with his pseudo-obedience.

    Keep in mind the following: People trying to make a show of their au-
thority are easily deceived by the surrender tactic. Your outward sign of
submission makes them feel important; satisfied that you respect them,
they become easier targets for a later counterattack, or for the kind of indi»
rect ridicule used by Brecht. Measuring your power over time, never sacri-
fice long-term maneuverability for the short-lived glories of martyrdom.

KEYS T0 POWER
What gets us into trouble in the realm of power is often our own overreac~
tion to the moves of our enemies and rivals. That overreaction creates

problems we would have avoided had we been more reasonable. It also
has an endless rebound effect, for the enemy then overreacts as well, much
as   the Athenians did to the Melians. It is always our first instinct to react, to
meet aggression with some other kind of aggression. But the next time
someone
            pushes you and you find yourself starting to react, try this: Do not
resist or fight back, but yield, turn the other cheek, bend. You will find that
this often neutralizes their behavior——they expected, even wanted you to
react with force and so they are caught ofiguard and confounded by your
lack of resistance. By yielding, you in fact control the situation, because
your surrender is part of a larger plan to lull them into believing they have
defeated you.
      This is the essence of the surrender tactic: Inwardly you stay firm, but

outwardly you bend. Deprived of a reason to get angry, your opponents
will often be bewildered instead. And they are unlikely to react with more
violence, which would demand a reaction from you. Instead you are al
lowed the time and space to plot the countermoves that will bring them
down. In the battle of the intelligent against the brutal and the aggressive,
the surrender tactic is the supreme weapon. It does require self~control:
Those who    genuinely surrender give up their freedom, and may be
crushed by the humiliation of their defeat You have to remember that you
only appear to surrender, like the animal that plays dead to save its hide.
    We have seen that it can be better to surrender than to fight; faced with
a. more
        powerful opponent and a sure defeat, it is often also better to sur-
render than to run away. Running away may save you for the time being,
but the aggressor will eventually catch up with you.      you surrender in-
stead, you have an opportunity to coil around your enemy and strike with
your fangs from close up.

                                                                                      LAW 22   167
                   In 473 B.C., in ancient China, King Goujian of Yue suffered a horrible
               defeat from the ruler of Wu in the battle of Fujiao. Goujian wanted to flee,
               but he had an adviser who told him to surrender and to place himself in the
               service of the ruler of Wu, from which position he could study the man and

               plot his revenge. Deciding to follow this advice, Goujian gave the ruler all
               of his riches, and went to work in his conqueror’s stables as the lowest ser-
               vant. For three years he humbled himself before the ruler, who then, finally
               satisfied of his loyalty, allowed him to return home. Inwardly, however,
               Goujian had spent those three years gathering information and plotting re-
               venge. When a terrible drought struck Wu, and the kingdom was weak
               ened by irmer turmoil, he raised an army, invaded, and won with ease.
               That is the power behind surrender: It gives you the time and the flexibility
               to plot a devastating counterblow. Had Goujian run away, he would have
               lost this chance.
                     When foreign trade began to threaten Japanese independence in the
               mid—nineteenth century, the Japanese debated how to defeat the foreign-
               ers. One   minister, Hotta Masayoshi, wrote a memorandum in 1857 that in-
               fluenced Japanese policy for years to come: “I am therefore convinced that
               our
                     policy should be to conclude friendly alliances, to send ships to foreign
               counhies everywhere and conduct trade, to copy the foreigners where they
               are at their best and so
                                          repair our own shortcomings, to foster our national
               strength and complete our armaments, and so gradually subject the foreigrr
               ers to our influence until in the end all the countries of the world know the

               blessings of perfect tranquillity and our hegemony is acknowledged
               throughout the globe.” This is a brilliant application of the Law: Use sur-
               render to gain access to your enemy. Learn his ways, insinuate yourself
               with him slowly, outwardly conform to his customs, but inwardly maintain
               your own culture. Eventually you will emerge victorious, for while he con—
               siders you weak and inferior, and takes no precautions against you, you are
               using the time to catch up and surpass him. This soft, penneable form of in»
               vasion is often the best, for the enemy has nothing to react against, prepare
               for, or resist. And had japan resisted Western influence by force, it might
               well have suffered a devastating invasion that would have permanently al-
               tered its culture.
                    Surrender can also offer a way of mocking your enemies, of turning
               their power against them, as it did for Brecht. Milan Kundera’s novel 7719
               Jake, based on the author’s experiences in a penal camp in Czechoslovakia,
                tells the story of how the prison guards organized a relay race, guards
                against prisoners. For the guards this was a chance to show off their physi-
                cal superiority. The prisoners knew they were expected to lose, so they
               went out of their way to oblige-—miming exaggerated exertion while

               barely moving, running a few yards and collapsing, limping, jogging ever
               so
                  slowly while the guards raced ahead at full speed. Both by joining the
               race and
                         by losing ig they had obliged the guards obediently; but their
               “overobedience” had mocked the event to the point of mining it. Overobe-
               dience—su.rrender—was here a way to demonstrate superiority in a re-
               verse manner. Resistance would      have engaged the prisoners in the cycle of

I65   LAW 22
violence, lowering them to the guards’ level. Overobeying the guards, how»
ever, made them ridiculous, yet they could not rightly punish the prison»
ers, who had only done what they asked.
    Power is always in flux—since the game is by nature fluid, and an arena
of constant struggle, those with power almost always find themselves even-
tually on the downward swing. If you find yourself temporarily weakened,
the surrender tactic is perfect for raising yourselfup again»-it disguises your
ambition; it teaches you patience and self—control, key skills in the game;
and it puts you in the best possible position for taking advantage of your up-
pressofs sudden slide. If you run away or fight back, in the long run you
cannot win. If you surrender, you will almost always emerge victorious.

               The point of surrendering is to save your hide for a later date when you
               can   reassert yourself. It is precisely to avoid martyrdom that one surren-

               ders, but there are times when the enemy will not relent, and martyrdom
               seems the only way out Furthermore, if you are willing to die, others may


               gain power and inspiration from your example.
                     Yet martyrdom, surrender’s reversal, is a. messy, inexact tactic, and is
               as violent as the aggression it combats. For
                                                               every famous martyr there are
               thousands more who have inspired neither a religion nor a rebellion, so
               that if martyrdom does sometimes grant a certain power, it does so unpre-
               dictably. More important, you will not be around to enjoy that power, such
               as it is. And there is
                                       finally something selfish and arrogant about martyrs,

                     When power deserts you, it is best to ignore this Law’s reversal. Leave

               martyrdom alone: The pendulum will swing back your way eventually,

    Once Mayer Amschel’s sons controlled the family business, they de-

finances of Europe as a whole, rather than being tied to any one country or
prince. Of the five brothers, Nathan had already opened up shop in Lon-

monopoly on information. And their internal communications and corre-
spondence were written in Frankfurt Yiddish, and in a code that only the
brothers could decipher. There was no point in stealing this information—-
 no one could understand it.   “Even the shewdest bankers cannot find their
way through the Rothschild maze,” admitted a financier who had tried to
infiltrate the clan.
     In 1824 James Rothschild decided it was time to get married. This pre-
 sented a problem for the Rothschilds, since it meant incorporating an out-
 sider into the Rothschild clan, an outsider who could betray its secrets.
jarnes therefore decided to marry within the family, and chose the daugh-
 ter of his brother Salomon. The brothers were ecstatic—~this was the per-
 fect solution to their marriage problems. james‘s choice now became the
 family policy: Two years later, Nathan married off his daughter to

                                                                                           LAW 23           I73
                    Salornon’s son. In the years to come, the five brothers arranged eighteen
                    matches among their cluldren, sixteen of these being contracted between
                    first cousins.
                        “We are like the mechanism of a watch: Each part is essential,” said
                    brother Salomon. As in a watch, every part of the business moved in con-
                    cert with every other, and the inner workings were invisible to the world,
                    which only saw the movement of the hands. While other rich and powerful
                    families suffered irrecoverable downturns during the tumultons first half of
                    the nineteenth century, the tight-knit Rothschilds managed not only to pre-
                    serve but to     expand their unprecedented wealth.

                    Interpretation
                    The Rothschilds were born in strange times. They came from a place that
                    had not changed in centuries, but lived in an age that gave birth to the In-
                    dustrial Revolution, the French Revolution, and an endless series of up-
                    heavals. The Rothchilds                   kept the past alive, resisted the patterns of
                    dispersion of their era and for this are emblematic of the law of concentra-
                    tion.
                            No one represents this better than _]ames Rothschild, the son who es-
                    tablished himself in Paris. in his lifetime james witnessed the defeat of
                    Napoleon, the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, the bourgeois monar-
                    chy of Orleans, the return to a republic, and finally the enthronement of
                    Napoleo 1 III. French styles and fashions changed at a relentless pace dur-
                    ing all this turmoil. Without appearing to be a relic of the past, James
                    steered his family as if the ghetto lived on within them. He kept alive his
                    clan’s inner cohesion and strength. Only through such an anchoring in the
                    past was the family able to thrive amidst such chaos. Concentration was the
                    foundation of the Rothschilds’ power, wealth, and stability.

                    KEYS TO POWER
                    The world is plagued by greater and geater division-——within countries,
                    political groups, families, even individuals. We are all in a state of total dis-
                    traction and diffusion, hardly able to keep our minds in one direction be-
                    fore we are pulled in a thousand others. The modern world’s level of
                    conflict is higher than ever, and we have internalized it in our own lives.
                            The solution is a form of retreat inside ourselves, to the past, to more
                    concentrated forms of thought and action. As Schopenhauer wrote, “Intel-
                    lect is a magnitude of intensity, not a magnitude of extensity.” Napoleon
                    knew the value of concentrating your forces at the enemy’s weakest spot——


Ir-4   ‘
           LAW 23
it was the secret of his success on the battlefield. But his willpower and his
mind were equally modeled on this notion. Single-mindedness of purpose,
total concentration on the goal, and the use of these qualifies against peo
ple less focused, people in a state of distraction—such an arrow will find its
mark every time and overwhelm the enemy.
       Casanova attributed his success in life to his ability to concentrate on a
single goal and push at it until it yielded. It was his ability to give himself
over   completely to the women he desired that made him so intensely se-
ducfive. For the weeks or months that one of these women lived in his
orbit, he thought of no one else. When he was imprisoned in the treacher-
ous “leads”  of the doge’s palace in Venice, a prison from which no one had
ever
      escaped, he concentrated his mind on the single goal of escape, day
after day. A change of cells, which meant that months of digging had all
been for naught, did not discourage him; he persisted and eventually es-
caped. “I have always believed,” he later wrote, “that when a man gets it
into his head to do something, and when he exclusively occupies himself in
that design, he must succeed, whatever the diliiculties. That man will be-
come Grand Vizier or       Pope.”
       Concentrate C 1 a single goal, a single task, and beat it into submission.
In the world of power you will constantly need help from other people,

usually those more powerful than you. The fool flits from one person to an-
other, believing that he will survive by spreading himself out. It is a corol-
lary of the law of concentration, however, that much energy is saved, and
more power is attained, by affixing yourself to a single, appropriate source

of power. The scientist Nikola Tesla. mined himself by believing that he
somehow maintained his independence by not having to serve a single
master. He even turned down         P. Morgan, who offered him a rich con-
tract. In the end, Tesla’s “independence” meant that he could depend on

no
    single patron, but was always having to toady up to a dozen of them.
Later in his life he realized his mistake.
       All the great Renaissance painters and writers wrestled with this prob-
lem, none      more   so   than the   sixteenth-century writer Pietro Aretino.
Throughout his life Aretino suffered the indignities of having to please this
prince and that. At last, he had had enough, and decided to woo Charles
V, promising the emperor the services of his powerful pen. He finally dis-
covered the freedom that came from attachment to             a
                                                                 single source of
power. Michelangelo found this freedom with Pope Julius II, Galileo with
the Medicis. In the end, the singie patron appreciates your loyalty and be-
comes
         dependent on your services; in the long run the master serves the
slave.
       Finally, power itself always exists in concentrated forms. In any orga-
nization it is inevitable for a small youp to hold the strings. And often it is
not those with the titles. In the game of power,      only the fool llails about
without fixing his target. You must find out who controls the operations,
who is the real director behind the scenes. As Richelieu discovered at the
beginning of his rise to the top of the French political scene during the

                                                                                    LAW 23   I 75
                early seventeenth century, it was not King Louis XIII who decided things,
                it was the king’s mother. And so he attached himself to her, and catapulted

                through the ranks of the courtiers, all the way to the top.
                     It is enough to strike oil once—your wealth and power are assured for
                a   lifetime.

                REVERSAI.
                There are dangers in concentration, and moments when dispersion is the
                proper tactical move. Fighting the Nationalists for control of China, Mao
                Tse~tung and the Communists fought a protracted war on several fronts,
                using sabotage and ambush as their main weapons. Dispersal is often suit-
                able for the weaker side; it is, in fact, a crucial principle of guerrilla warfare.
                When fighting a stronger army, concentrating your forces only makes you
                an    easier    ta.rget—better to dissolve into the scenery and frustrate your
                enemy with the elusiveness of your presence.
                     Tying yourself to a single source of power has one preeminent danger:
                If that person dies, leaves, or falls from grace, you suffer. This is what hap-

                pened to Cesare Borgia, who derived his power from his father, Pope
                Alexander VI. It was the pope who gave Cesare armies to fight with and
                wars to
                        wage in his name. When he suddenly died (perhaps from poison),


I 76   LAW 23
Cesare was as good as dead. He had made far too many enemies over the
years, and was now without his father’s protection. In cases when you may
need protection, then, it is ofien wise to entwine yourself around several
sources of power. Such a move would be especially prudent in periods of

great tumult and violent change, or when your enemies are numerous. The
more patrons and masters
                            you serve the less risk you run if one of them
falls from power. Such dispersion will even allow you to play one off
against the other. Even if you concentrate on the single source of power,
you still must practice caution, and 1 cepare for the day when your master
or
     patron is no longer there to help you.
     Finally, being too singlerminded in purpose can make you an intolera~
ble bore, especially in the arts. The Renaissance painter Paolo Uccello was
so obsessed with
                   perspective that his paintings look lifeless and contrived.
Whereas Leonardo da Vinci interested himself in everything«-architec-
ture, painting, warfare, sculpture, mechanics. Diffusion was the source of
his power. But such genius is rare, and the rest of us are better off erring on
the side of intensity.

Never Afiect Friendliness and Intimacy with Your Master. He does
not want a friend for a subordinate, he wants a subordinate. Never
                                                                     ap-
proach him  in an easy, friendly way, or act as if you are on the best of
ten'ns—that is his prerogative. If he chooses to deal with you on this level,
assume a wary   nhumminess. Otherwise err in the opposite direction, and
make the distance between you clear.


Never Criticize Those Above You Directly. This may seem obvious,
but there are often times when some sort of criticism is necessary—to say
nothing, or to give no advice, would open you to risks of another sort. You
must learn, however, to couch
                               your advice and criticism as indirectly and as
politely as possible. Think twice, or three times, before deciding you have
made them sufficiently circuitous. Err on the side of subtlety and gentleness.


Be Frugal in Asking Those Above You for Favors.            Nothing imitates a
master more than   having   to reject someone’s request It stirs up guilt and
resentment. Ask for favors as rarely as possible, and know when to stop.
Rather than making yourself the supplicant, it is always better to earn your
favors, so that the ruler bestows them willingly. Most important: Do not ask
for favors on another person’s behalf, least of all a friend’s.


Never joke About Appearances or Taste. A lively wit and a humorous
disposition are essential qualifies for a good courtier, and there are times
when vulgarity is appropriate and engaging. But avoid any kind of joke
about appearance or taste, two highly sensitive areas, especially with those
above you. Do not even try it when you are away from them. You will dig
your own grave.

Do Not Be the Court Cynic.           Express admiration for the good work of
others. If you constantly criticize your equals or subordinates some of that
criticism will rub off on you, hovering over you like a gray cloud wherever

you go. People will groan at each new cynical comment, and you will irn'~
tate them. By expressing modest admiration for other
                                                      people’s achieve-
ments, you paradoxically call attention to your own. The ability to express
wonder and amazement, and seem like you mean it, is a rare and dying tal-
ent, but one still greatly valued.


Be Self-observant. The mirror is a miraculous invention; without it you
would commit great sins against beauty and decorum. You also need a mir-
ror for
      your actions. This can sometimes come from other people telling
you what they see in you, but that is not the most trustworthy method: Ybu
must be the mirror, training your mind to
                                              try to see yourself as others see
you. Are you acting too obsequious? Are you trying too hard to please? Do
you seem desperate for attention, giving the impression that you are on the
decline? Be observant about yourself and you will avoid a mountain of
blunders.

                Master Your Emotions. As an actor in a great play, you must learn to cry
                and laugh on command and when it is appropriate. You must be able both
                to disguise your anger and frustration and to fake your contentment and
                agreement. You must be the master of your own face, Call it lying if you
                like; but if you prefer to not play the game and to always be honest and up-
                front, do not complain when others call you obnoxious and arrogant.

                Fit the Spirit of the Tunes. A slight affectation of a past era can be
                charming, as long as you choose a period at least twenty years back; wear-
                ing the fashions of ten years ago is ludicrous, unless you enjoy the role of
                court jester. Your spirit and way of thinking must keep up with the times,
                even   if the times offend your sensibilities. Be too forward-thinking, how-
                ever, and no one will understand you. It is never a good idea to stand out
                too much in this area; you are best off at least    being able to mimic the spirit
                of the times.


                Be a Source of Pleasure. This is critical. It is an obvious law of human
                nature that we will flee what is unpleasant and distasteful, while charm and
                the promise of delight will draw us like moths to a flame. Make yourself the
                flame and you will rise to the top. Since life is otherwise so full of unpleas-
                antness and pleasure so scarce, you will be as indispensable as food and
                drink. This may seem obvious, but what is obvious is often ignored or un-
                appreciabed. There are degrees to this: Not everyone can play the role of
                favorite, for not everyone is blessed with charm and wit. But we can all
                control our unpleasant qualities and obscure them when necessary.

                SCENES OF COURT Ll FE: Exemplary Deeds and Fatal Mistakes


                Scene 1
                Alexander the Great, conqueror of the Mediterranean basin and the Mid-
                dle East through to India, had had the great Aristotle as his tutor and men-
                tor, and throughout his short life he remained devoted to philosophy and
                his master’s teachings. He once complained to Aristotle that during his

                long campaigns he had no one with whom he could discuss philosophical
                matters. Aristotle responded by suggesting that he take Callisthenes, a for-
                mer
                     pupil of Aristotle’s and a promising philosopher in his own right,
                along on the next campaign.
                    Aristotle had schooled Callisthenes in the skills of being a courtier, but


182   LAW '24
the young man secretly scoffed at them. He believed in pure philosophy, in
Imadorned words, in speaking the naked truth. If Alexander loved learning
so   much, Callisthenes thought, he could not object to one who spoke his
mind. During one of Alexander’s major campaigns, Callisthenes spoke his
mind one too many times and Alexander had him put to death.

Interpretation
In court, honesty is a fool’s game. Never be so self-absorbed as to believe
that the master is interested in your criticisms of him, no matter how accu-
rate   they are.

Scene II
Beginning in the Han Dynasty two thousand years ago, Chinese scholars
compiled a series of writings called the 27 Histories, an official biography of
each dynasty, including stories, statistics, census figures, and war chroni-
cles. Each history also contained a chapter called “Unusual Events,” and
here, among the listings of earthquakes and floods, there would sometimes
suddenly appear descriptions of such bizarre manifestations as two—headed
sheep, geese flying backward, stars suddenly appearing in different parts of
the sky, and so on. The earthquakes could be historically verified, but the
monsters and weird natural phenomena were clearly inserted on purpose,

and invariably occurred in clusters. What could this mean?
    The Chinese emperor was considered more than a man—he was a
force of nature. His kingdom was the center of the universe, and every-
thing revolved around him. He embodied the world’s perfection. To criti-
cize him or any of his actions would have been to criticize the divine order.
No minister or courtier dared approach the emperor with even the slightest

cautionary word. But emperors were fallihle and the kingdom suffered
greatly by their mistakes. Inserting sightings of strange phenomena into the
court chronicles was the   only way to warn them. The emperor would read
of geese flying backward and moons out of orbit, and realize that he was
being cautioned. His actions were unbalancing the universe and needed to
change.
interpretation
For Chinese courtiers, the problem of how to give the emperor advice was
an
   important issue. Over the years, thousands of them had died trying to
warn or counsel their master. To be made
                                            safely, their criticisms had to be
               if
indirect--yet they    were ton indirect
                                          they would not be heeded. The
chronicles were their solution: Identify no one person as the source of criti«
cism, make the advice as impersonal as possible, but let the emperor know
the gravity of the situation.
       Your master is no longer the center of the universe, but he still imag-
ines that everything revolves around him. When you criticize him he sees
the person criticizing, not the criticism itself. Like the Chinese courtiers,

you must find a way to disappear behind the warning. Use symbols and
other indirect methods to paint a picture of the problems to come, without

putting your neck on the line.

                Scene III
                Early in his career, the French architect Jules Mansart received commis-
                sions to design minor additions to Versailles for King Louis XIV. For each

                design he would draw up his plans, making sure they followed Louis’s in-
                structions closely. He would then present them to His Majesty.
                     The courtier Saint-Simon described MansaIt’s technique in dealing
                with the king: “His particular skill was to show the king plans that pur»
                posely included something imperfect about them, often dealing with the
                gardens, which were not Mansart’s specialty. The king, as Mansart ex-
                pected, would put his finger exactly on the problem and propose how to
                solve it, at which point Mansart would exclaim for all to hear that he would
                never have seen    the problem that the king had so masterfully found and
                solved; he would burst with admiration, confessing that next to the king he
                was    but a lowly pupil.” At the age of thirty, having used these methods
                time and time again, Mansart received a prestigious royal commission: Al:

                though he was less talented and experienced than a number of other
                French designers, he was to take charge of the enlargement of Versailles.
                He was the king’s architect from then on.

                Interpretation
                As a young man, Mansart had seen how many royal craftsmen in the sen
                vice of Louis XIV had lost their positions not through a lack of talent but

                through a costly social blunder. He would not make that mistake. Mansart
                always strove to make Louis feel better about himself, to feed the king’s
                vanity as publicly as possible.
                       Never imagine that skill and talent are all that matter. In court the
                courtier’s art is more important than his talent; never spend so much time
                on
                     your studies that you neglect your social skills. And the greatest skill of
                all is the ability to make the master look more talented than those around
                him.


                Scene IV
                Jean-Baptiste Isabey had become the unofficial painter of the Napoleonic
                 court. During the Congress of Vienna in 1814, after Napoleon, defeated,
                 had been imprisoned on the island of Elba, the participants in these meet-

                ings, which were to decide the fate of Europe, invited Isabey to immortal-
                 ize the historic events in an epic painting.
                      When Isabey arrived in Vienna, Talleyrand, the main negotiator for
                 the French, paid the artist a visit. Considering his role in the proceedings,
                the statesman explained, he expected to occupy center stage in the paint-

                 ing. Isabey cordially agreed. A few days later the Duke of Wellington, the
                 main negotiator for the English, also approached Isabey, and said much
                 the same thing that Talleyrand had. The ever polite Isabey agreed that the
                great duke should indeed he the center of attention.
                     Back in his studio, Isabey pondered the dilemma. If he gave the spot-
                light to either of the two men, he could create a diplomatic rift, stirring up
                all sorts of resentment at a time when peace and concord were critical.



I 84   LAW 24
When the painting was finally unveiled, however, both Talleyrand and
Wellington felt honored and satisfied. The work depicts a large hall filled
with diplomats and politicians from allover Europe. 011 one side the Duke
of Wellington enters the room, and all eyes are turned toward him; he is
the “center” of attention. In the very center of the painting, meanwhile, sits
Talleyiand.
Interpretafion
It is often very difficult to satisfy the master, but to satisfy two masters in
one stroke takes the   genius of a great courtier. Such predicaments are comw
mon   in the life of a courtier: By giving attention to one master, he dis-

pleases another. You must find a way to navigate this Scylla and Charybdis
safely. Masters must receive their due; never inadvertently stir up the re
sentment of one in pleasing another.



Scene V
George Brummell, also known as Beau Brummell, made his mark in the
late 1700s by the supreme elegance of his appearance, his popularization of
shoe buckles (soon imitated by all the dandies). and his clever way with
words. His London house was the fashionable spot in town, and Brunnnell
was the authority on all matters of fashion. If he disliked your footwear,

you immediately got rid of it and bought whatever he was wearing. He per-
fected the art of tying a cravat; Lord Byron was said to spend many a night
in front of the mirror trying to figure out the secret behind Brummell’s per-
fect knots.
    One of Brummell’s greatest admirers was the Prince of Wales, who
fancied himself a fashionable young man. Becoming attached to the
prince’s court (and provided with a royal pension), Brummell was soon so
sure of his‘ own authority there that he took to joking about the prince’s

weight, referring to his host as Big Ben. Since trimness of figure was an im~
portant quality for a. dandy, this was a withering criticism. At dinner once,
when the service was slow, Brummell said to the prince, “Do ting, Big
Ben” The prince rang, but when the valet arrived he ordered the man to
show Brummell the door and never admit him again.
    Despite falling into the prince’s disfavor, Brummell continued to treat
everyone around him with the same arrogance. Without the Prince of
Wales’ patronage to support him, he sank into horrible debt, but he main
tained his insolent manners, and everyone soon abandoned him. He died
in the most pitiahle poverty, alone and deranged.

Interpretation
Beau Brummell’s devastating wit was one of the qualifies that endeared
him to the Prince of Wales. But not even he, the arbiter of taste and fashion,
could get away with a joke about the prince’s appearance, least of all to his
face. Never joke about a person’s plumpness, even indirectly—and particu*
larly when he is your master. The poorhouses of history are filled with peo-
ple who have made such jokes at their master’s expense.

                     Scene VI
                     Pope Urban VIII wanted to be remembered for his skills in writing poetry,
                     which unfortunately were mediocre at best. In 1629 Duke Francesco
                     d’Este, knowing the pope’s literary pretensions, sent the poet Fulvio Testi
                     as his
                            ambassador to the Vatican. One of Tes|i’s letters to the duke reveals
                     why he was chosen: “Once our discussion was over, I kneeled to depart,
                     but His Holiness made a signal and walked to another room where he

                     sleeps, and after reaching a small table, he grabbed at bundle of papers and
                     thus, turning to me with a smiling face, he said: ‘We want Your Lordship to
                     listen to some of our compositions.’ And, in fact, he read me two very long
                     Pindaric poems, one in praise of the most hoiy Virgin, and the other one
                     about Countess Matilde.”
                         We do not know exactly what Testi thought of these very long poems,
                     since it would have been dangerous for him to state his opinion freely,
                     even in a letter. But he went on to write, “I,
                                                                    following the mood, com-
                     mented on each line with the needed praise, and, after having kissed His
                     Holiness’s foot for such an unusual sign of benevolence [the reading of the
                     poetry], I left.” Weeks later, when the duke himself visited the pope, he
                     managed to recite entire verses of the pope’s poetry and praised it enough
                     to make the pope “so jubilant he seemed to lose his mind.”

                     Interpretation
                     In matters of taste you can never be too obsequious with your master. Taste
                     is one of the ego’s pxickliest parts; never impugn or question the master’s
                     taste-——his poetry is sublime, his dress impeccable, and his manner the
                     model for all.

                     cold, the crowrrkeeper placed his own coat over the ruler, and left.

                     dants, “Who put more clothes on my body?” “The crowmkeeper,” they
                     replied. The ruler immediately called for his ofiicial coat—keeper and had
                     him punished for neglecting his duties. He also called for the          crown-

                     keeper, whom he had beheaded.
                     Interpretation
                     Do not overstep your bounds. Do what you are assigned to do, to the best
                     of your abilities, and never do more. To think that by doing more you are
                     doing better is a common blunder. It is never good to seem to be trying too
                     ha.rd——-it is as if you were covering up some deficiency. Fulfilling a task that
                     has not been asked of you just makes people suspicious. If you are a crown-
                     keeper, be a crowmkeeper. Save your excess energy for when you are not
                     in the court.

Scene VIII
One day, for amusement, the Italian Renaissance painter Fra Filippo Lippi
(1406-1469) and some friends went sailing in a small boat off Ancona.
There they were captured by two Moorish galleys, which hauled them off
in chains to Barbary, where they were sold as slaves. For eighteen long
months Filippo toiled with no hope of returning to Italy.
    On several occasions Filippo saw the man who had bought him pass
by, and one day he decided to sketch this man’s portrait, using burnt
coal~charcoal—from the fire. Still in his chains, he found a white wall,
where he drew a full—length likeness of his owner in Moorish clothing. The
owner soon heard about     this, for no one had seen such skill in drawing be-
fore in these parts; it seemed like a miracle, 3. gift from God. The drawing
so
   pleased the owner that be instantly gave Filippo his freedom and em—
ployed him in his court. All the big men on the Barbary coast came to see
the magnificent color portraits that Fra Filippo then proceeded to do, and
finally, in gratitude for the honor in this way brought upon him, Filippcfs
owner returned the artist
                            safely to Italy.
lnterpretation
We who toil for other people have all in some way been captured by pi-
rates and sold into slavery. But like Fra Filippo (if to a lesser degree), most
of us possess some gift, some talent, an ability to do something better than
other people. Make your master a gift of your talents and you will rise
above other courtiers. Let him take the credit if necessary, it will only be
temporary: Use him as a stepping stone, a way of displaying your talent
and eventually buying your freedom from enslavernent.


Scene IX
Alfonso I of Aragon once had a servant who told the king that the night
before he had had a dream: Alfonso had given him a gift of weapons,
horses, and clothes. Alfonso, a generous, lordly man, decided it would be
amusing to make this dream come true, and promptly gave the servant
exactly these gifts.
       A little while later, the same servant announced to Alfonso that he had
had yet another dream, and in this one Alfonso had given him a consider-
able    pile of gold florins. The king smiled and said, “Don't believe in
dreams from now on; they lie.”

interpretation
In his treatment of the servant’s first dream, Alfonso remained in control.
By making a dream come true, he claimed a godlike power for himself, if
in a mild and humorous way. In the second dream, however, all appear-
ance of
        magic was gone; this was nothing but an ugly con game on the set»
vant’s part. Never ask for too much, then, and know when to stop. It is the
master’s prerogative to give——to give when he wants and what he wants,
and to do so without prompting. Do not give him the chance to reject your
requests. Better to win favors by deserving them, so that they are bestowed
without your asking.


                                                                                  LAW 24   157
                    Scene X
                    The great English landscape painter         M. W. Turner (1775-1851)      was

                    known for his use of color, which he applied with a brilliance and a strange
                    iridescence. The color in his paintings was so striking, in fact, that other
                    artists never wanted his work hung next to theirs: It inevitably made every-

                    thing around it seem dull.
                          The painter Sir Thomas Lawrence once had the misfortune of seeing
                    Turner’s masterpiece Cologne hanging in an exhibition between two works
                    of his own. Lawrence complained bitterly to the gallery owner, who gave
                    him no satisfaction: After all, someone’: paintings had to hang next to
                    Tumer’s. But Turner heard of Lawrence’s complaint, and before the exhibi-
                    tion opened, he toned down the brilliant golden sky in Cologne, making it as
                    dull as the colors in Lawrence’s works. A friend of Tumer’s who saw the
                    painting approached the artist with a horrified look: “What have you done
                    to your  picture!” he said. “Well, poor Lawrence was so unhappy,” Turner
                    replied, “and it’s only lampblack. It’ll wash off after the exhibition.”
                    Interpretation
                    Many of a courtier’s anxieties have to do with the master, with whom most
                    dangers lie. Yet it is a mistake to imagine that the master is the only one to
                    determine your fate. Your equals and subordinates play integral parts also.
                    A court is a vast stew of resentments, fears, and powerful envy. You have to

                    placate everyone who might someday harm you, deflecting their resent-
                    ment and envy and diverting their hostility onto other people.

                          Turner, eminent courtier, knew that his good fortune and fame de
                    pended on his fellow painters as well as on his dealers and patrons. How
                    many of the great have been felled by envious colleagues! Better temporar-
                    ily to dull your brilliance than to suffer the slings and arrows of envy.

                    Scene XI
                    Winston Churchill was an amateur artist, and after World War II his paint-
                    ings became collector’s items. The American publisher Henry Luce, in
                    fact, creator of Time and L2)? magazines, kept one of Churchill’s landscapes
                    hanging in his private office in New York.
                         On a tour through the United States once, Churchill visited Luce in his
                    office, and the two men looked at the painting together. The publisher re-
                    marked, “It’s a good picture, but I think it needs something in the fore-
                    ground-—a sheep, perhaps.” Much to Luce’s horror, Churcl1ill’s secretary
                    called the publisher the next day and asked him to have the painting sent
                    to England. Luce did so, mortified that he had perhaps offended the former
                    prime minister. A few days later, however, the painting was shipped back,
                    but slightly altered: a single sheep now grazed peacefully in the fore
                    ground.
                    Interpretation
                    In stature and fame, Churchill stood head and shoulders above Luce, but
                    Luce was certainly a man of power, so let us imagine a slight equality be-
                    tween them. Still, what did Churchill have to fear from an American      pub
                    lisher? Why bow to the criticism of a dilettante?
       ‘




18!?       LAW 24
    A court-—-in this case the entire world of diplomats and international
statesmen, and also of the journalists who court them--is a place of mutual
dependence. It is unwise to insult or olifend the taste of people of power,
even if  they are below or equal to you. If 3. man like Churchill can swallow
the criticisms of a man like Luce, he proves himself a courtier without peer.
(Perhaps his correction of the painting implied a certain condescension as
well, but he did it so subtly that Luce did not perceive any slight.) lmitate
Churchill: Put in the sheep. It is always beneficial to play the obliging
courtier, even when you are not serving a master.




THE DELEGATE GAME OF COURTIERSHIP: A Warning
Talleyraud was the consummate courtier, especially in serving his master
Napoleon. When the two men were first getting to know each other,
Napoleon once said in passing, “I shall come to lunch at your house one of
these days.” Talleyrancl had a house at Auteuil, in the suburbs of Paris. “I
should be delighted, man général,” the minister replied, “and since my
house is close to the Bois de Boulogne, you will be able to amuse yourself
with a bit of shooting in the afternoon.”
    “I do not like shooting,” said Napoleon, “But I love hunting. Are there
any boars in the Bois de Boulogne?” Napoleon came from Corsica, where
boar hunting was a great sport. By asking if there were boars in at Paris
park, he showed himself still a. provincial, almost a tube. Talleyrand did not
laugh, however, but he could not resist a practical joke on the man who
was now his master in
                         politics, although not in blood and nobility, since
Talleyrand  came   from  an old aristocratic family. To Napoleorfs question,
then, he simply replied, “Very few, man généml, but I dare say you will man-
age to find one.”
     It was arranged that Napoleon would arrive at Talleyrand’s house the
following day at seven AM. and would spend the morning there. The “boar
hunt” would take place in the afternoon. Throughout the morning the ex-
cited general talked nothing but boar hunting. Meanwhile, Talleyrand see
cretly had his servants go to the market, buy two enormous black pigs, and
take them to the great park.
    After   lunch, the hunters and their hounds set off for the Bois de
Boulogne. At a secret signal from Talleyrand, the servants loosed one of the
pigs. “I see a boar,” Napoleon cried joyfully, jumping onto his horse to give
chase. Talleyrand stayed behind. It took half an hour of galloping through
the park before the “boat” was finally captured. At the moment of triumph,
however, Napoleon was approached by one of his aides, who knew the
creature could not possibly be at boar, and feared the general would be
ridiculed once the story got out: “Sir,” he told Napoleon, “you realize of
course that this is not a bear but a
                                     pig.”
     Flying into a rage, Napoleon immediately set off at a gallop for Tal-
leyrand’s house. He realized along the way that he would now be the butt
of many a joke, and that exploding at Talleyrand would only make him
                                                                                          '




                                                                                 LAW 24       199
               more   ridiculous; it would be better to make a show of good humor. Still, he
               did not hide his displeasure well.
                    Talleyrand decided to try to soothe the general’s bruised ego. He told
               Napoleon not to go back to Paris yet-«he should again go hunting in the
               park. There were many rabbits there, and hunting them had been a. fa-
               vorite pastime of Louis XVI. Talleyrand even offered to let Napoleon use a
               set of guns that had once belonged to Louis. With much flattery and cajol—

               ery, he once again got Napoleon to agree to a hunt.
                    The party left for the park in the late afternoon. Along the way,
               Napoleon told Talleyrand, “Pm not Louis XVI, I surely won’t kill even one
               rabbit.” Yet that afternoon, strangely enough, the park was teeming with
               rabbits. Napoleon killed at least fifty of them, and his mood changed from
               anger to satisfaction. At the end of his wild shooting spree, however, the
               same aide
                          approached him and whispered in his ear, “To tell the truth, sir, I
               am
                   beginning to believe these are not wild rabbits. I suspect that rascal T31»
               leyrand has played another joke on us.” (The aide was right: Talleyrand
               had in fact sent his servants back to the market, where they had purchased
               dozens of rabbits and then had released them in the Bois de Boulogne.)
                    Napoleon immediately mounted his horse and galloped away, this
               time returning straight to Paris. He later threatened Talleyrand, warned
               him not to tell a soul what had happened; if he became the laughingstock
               of Paris, there would be hell to pay.
                   It took months for Napoleon to be able to trust Talleyrand again, and
               he never totally forgave him his humiliation.


               Interpretation
               Courtiers are like magicians: They deceptively play with appearances,
               only letting those around them see what they want them to see. With so
               much deception and manipulation afoot, it is essential to keep people from
               seeing your tricks and glimpsing your sleight of hand.
                    Talleyrand was normally the Grand Vlfizard of Courtiership, and but
               for Napoleoifs aide, he probably would have gotten away completely with
               both pleasing his master and having a joke at the generafs expense. But
               courtiership is a subtle art, and overlooked traps and inadvertent mistakes
               can ruin your best tricks. Never risk
                                                        being caught in your maneuvers;
               never let
                         people see your devices. If that happens you instantly pass in peo
               ple’s perceptions from a courtier of great manners to a loathsome rogue. It
               is a delicate game you play; apply the utmost attention to covering your

               tracks, and never let your master unmask you.

Rock. Crowds from all over the empire flocked to these events, the roads to
Rome lined with visitors’ tents. And in 45 B.C., timing his entry into the city
for maximum effect and surprise, Caesar brought Cleopatra back to Rome
after his Egyptian campaign, and staged even more extravagant public

spectacles.
    These events were more than devices to divert the masses; they dra~

 seem larger than life. Caesar was the master of his public image, of which

he was forever aware. When he appeared before crowds he wore the most
spectacular purple robes. He would be upstaged by no one. He was notori-
ously vain about his appearance—it was said that one reason he enjoyed
being honored by the Senate and people was that on these occasions he
could wear a laurel wreath, hiding his baldness. Caesar was a masterful or-
ator. He knew how to say a lot by saying a little, intuited the moment to
end a speech for maximum effect. He never failed to incorporate a surprise
into his public appearances—a startling announcement that would

heighten their drama.
     Immensely popular among the Roman people, Caesar was hated and
feared by his rivals. On the ides of March——March 15—in the year 44 B.C.,
a
  group of conspirators led by Brutus and Cassius surrounded him in the
senate and stabbed him to death. Even dying, however, he kept his sense of
drama. Drawing the top of his gown over his face, he let go of the cloth’s
lower part so that it draped his legs, allowing him to die covered and de-
cent. According to the Roman historian Suetonius, his final words to his
old friend Brutus, who was about to deliver a second blow, were in Greek,
and as if rehearsed for the end of a play: “You too, my child?”


Interpretation
The Roman theater was an event for the masses, attended by crowds
unimaginable today. Packed into enormous auditoriums, the audience
would be amused by raucous comedy or moved by high tragedy. Theater
seemed to contain the essence of life, in its concentrated, dramatic form.
Like a religious ritual, it had a powerful, instant appeal to the common
man.


   Julius Caesar was perhaps the first public figure to understand the vital
link between power and theater. This was because of his own obsessive in»
terest in drama. He sublimated this interest   by making himself an actor and
director on the world stage. He said his lines as if they had been scripted;
he gestured and moved through a crowd with a constant sense of how he

appeared to his audience. He incorporated surprise into his repertoire,
building drama into his speeches, staging into his public appearances. His
gestures were broad enough for the common man to grasp them instantly.
He became immensely popular.‘
    Caesar set the ideal for all leaders and people of power. Like him, you
must leam to enlarge your actions through dramatic techniques such as



                                                                                  LAW 25   19.?
                surprise, suspense, the creation of sympathy, and symbolic identification.
                Also like him, you must be constantly aware of your audience——of what
                will please them and what will bore them. You must arrange to place your-
                self at the center, to command attention, and never to be upstaged at any
                cost.




                OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
                In the year 1831, a young woman named Aurore Dupin Dudevant left her
                husband and family in the provinces and moved to Paris. She wanted to be
                a   writer; marriage, she felt, was worse than prison, for it left her neither the
                time nor the freedom to pursue her passion. In Paris she would establish
                her independence and make her living by writing.
                        Soon after Dudevant arrived in the capital, however, she had to con
                front certain harsh realities. To have any degree of freedom in Paris you
                had to have money. For a woman, money could only come through mar»
                rlage or prostitution. No woman had ever come close to making a living by
                writing. Women wrote as a hobby, supported by their husbands, or by an
                inheritance. In fact when Dudevant first showed her writing to an editor,
                he told her, “You should make babies, Madame, not literature,”
                     Clearly Dudevant had come to Paris to attempt the impossible. In the
                end, though, she came up with a strategy to do what no woman had ever
                donew-a strategy to re-create herself completely, forging a public image of
                her own making. Women writers before her had been forced into a ready-
                made   role, that of the second-rate arfist who wrote mostly for other
                women. Dudevant decided that if she had to  play a role, she would turn the
                game around: She would play the part of a man.
                    In 1832 a publisher accepted Dudevanfs first major novel, Indium.
                She had chosen to publish it under a pseudonym, “George Sand,” and all
                of Paris assumed this impressive new writer was male. Dudevant had
                sometimes worn men’s clothes before creating “George Sand” (she had al-

                ways found men‘s shirts and riding breeches more comfortable); now, as
                a
                  public figure, she exaggerated the image. She added long men’s coats,
                gray hats, heavy boots, and dandyish cravats to her wardrobe. She smoked
                cigars and in conversation expressed herself like a man, unafraid to domiv
                nate the conversation or to use a. saucy word,

                        This strange “male/female” writer fascinated the public. And unlike
                other women writers, Sand found herself accepted into the clique of male
                artists. She drank and smoked with them, even carried on affairs with the
                most famous artists of Europe—Musset, Liszt,        Chopin. It was she who did
                the wooing, and also the abandoning-—she moved on at her discretion.
                     Those who knew Sand well understood that her male persona pro-
                tected her from the public’s prying eyes. Out in the world, she enjoyed
                playing the part to the extreme; in private she remained herself. She also
                realized that the character of “George Sand” could grow stale or pre-
                dictable, and to avoid this she would every now and then dramatically alter


194   L AW 25
the character she had created; instead of conducting affairs with famous
men, she would begin meddling in politics, leading demonstrations, inspir-

ing student rebellions. No one would dictate to her the limits of the charac-
ter she had created. Long after she died, and after most people had stopped

reading her novels, the larger-than—life theatricality of that character has
continued to fascinate and inspire.


Interpretation
Throughout Sand’s public life, acquaintances and other artists who spent
time in her company had the feeling they were in the presence of a man.
But in her journals and to her closest friends, such as Gustave Flaubert, she
confessed that she had no desire to be a man, but was playing a part for
public consumption. What she really wanted was the power to determine
her own character. She refused the limits her society would have set on her.
She did not attain her power, however, by being herself; instead she cre-
ated a persona that she could constantly adapt to her own desires, a per-
sona that attracted attention and gave her presence.

       Understand this: The world wants to assign you a role in life. And
once
        you accept that role you are doomed. Your power is limited to the
tiny amount allotted to the role you have selected or have been forced to
assume. An actor, on the otherhand, plays many roles. Enjoy that protean
power, and if it is beyond you, at least forge a new identity, one of your
own     making, one that has had no boundaries assigned to it by an envious
and resentful world. This act of defiance is Promethean: It makes you re»

sponsible for your own creation.
     Your new identity will protect you from the world precisely because it
is not “you”; it is a costume you put on and take off. You need not take it

personally. And your new identity sets you apart, gives you theatrical pres-
ence. Those in the back rows can see
                                               you and hear you. Those in the front
rows marvel at
                    your audacity.

 Do not people talk in society of a man being a great actor? They do not mean by
       that that he/"eels, but that he excels in simulating, though hefeels nothing.
                                I)»m,i.r I)iderot, 1713-1 784




KEYS TO POWER
The character you seem to have been born with is not necessarily who you
are; beyond the characteristics you have inherited, your parents, your
friends, and your peers have helped to shape your personality. The
Promethean task of the powerful is to take control of the process, to stop al-
lowing others that ability to limit and mold them. Remake yourself into a
character of power. Working on yourself like clay should be one of your
greatest and most pleasurable life tasks. It makes you in essence an a11ist—
an artist
          creating yourself.
       In fact, the idea of self—creation comes from the world of art. For thou-



                                                                                       LAW 25   195
               sands of years, only kings and the highest courtiers had the freedom to
               shape their public image and determine their own identity. Similarly, only
               kings and the wealthiest lords could contemplate their own image in art,
               and consciously alter it. The rest of mankind played the limited role that
               society demanded of them, and had little selficonsciousness.
                    A shift in this condition can be detected in Velézquez’s painting La:
               Marinas, made in 1656. The artist appears at the left of the canvas, standing
               before a painting that he is in the process of creating. but that has its back
               to us——-we cannot see it. Beside him stands a princess, her attendanw, and

               one of the court dwarves, all
                                                 watching him work. The people posing for the
               painting  are   not directly visible, but we can see them in tiny reflections in a
               mirror on the back wal]—-—the king and queen of
                                                                     Spain, who must be sitting
               somewhere in the foreground, outside the picture.
                    The painting represents a dramatic change in the dynamics of power
               and the ability to determine one’s own position in society. For Velazquez,
               the artist, is far more prominently positioned than the king and queen. In a
               sense he is more
                                   powerful than they are, since he is clearly the one control»
               ling the irnage--their image. Velazquez no longer saw himself as the slav-
               ish, dependent artist. He had remade himself into a man of power. And
               indeed the first people other than aristocrats to play openly with their
               image in Western society were artists and writers, and later on dandies and
               bohemians. Today the concept of selflcreation has slowly filtered down to
               the rest of society, and has become an ideal to aspire to. Like Velazquez,
               you must demand for yourself the power to determine your position in the
               painting, and to create your own image.
                   The first step in the process of self—creation is self-consciousness-
               being aware of yourself as an actor and taking control of your appearance
               and emotions. As Diderot said, the bad actor is the one who is always sin-
               cere.
                     People who wear their hearts on their sleeves out in society are tire-
               some and
                         embarrassing. Their sincerity notwithstanding, it is hard to take
               them seriously. Those who cry in public may temporarily elicit sympathy,
               but sympathy soon turns to scorn and irritation at their self-
               obsessiveness-«~they are crying to get attention, we feel, and a malicious
               part of us wants to deny them the satisfaction.
                    Good actors control themselves better. They can play sincere and
               heartfelt, can affect a tear and a compassionate look at will, but they don’t
               have to feel it. They externalize emotion in a form that others can under-
               stand. Method acting is fatal in the real world. No ruler or leader could

               possibly play the part if all of the emotions he showed had to be real. So
               learn self-control. Adopt the plasticity of the actor, who can mold his or her
               face to the emotion required.
                   The second step in the process of selflcreation is a Variation on the
               George Sand strategy: the creation of a memorable character, one that
               compels attention, that stands out above the other players on the stage.
               This was the game Abraham Lincoln played. The homespun, common
               country man, he knew, was a kind of president that America had never had


196   LAW 25
but would delight in electing. Although many of these qualifies came natu-
rally to him, he played them up--the hat and clothes, the beard. (No presi-
dent before him had worn a beard.) Lincoln was also the first president to
use photographs to spread his image, helping to create the icon of the

“homespun president.”
     Good drama, however, needs more than an interesting appearance, or
a single stand-out moment. Drama takes place over time—~it is an unfold-


ing event Rhythm and timing are critical. One of the most important ele
ments in the rhythm of drama is suspense. Houdini for instance, could
sometimes complete his escape acts in seconds——but he drew them out to
minutes, to make the audience sweat.
    The key to keeping the audience on the edge of their seats is letting
events unfold slowly, then speeding them up at the right moment, accord-

ingto a pattern and tempo that you control. Great rulers from Napoleon to
Mao Tseturig have used theatrical timing to surprise and divert their pub
lic. Franklin Delano Roosevelt understood the importance of staging polio»
cal events in R particular order and rhythm.
    At the time of his 1932 presidential election, the United States was in
the midst of a dire economic crisis. Banks were failing at an alarming rate.
Shortly after winning the election, Roosevelt went into at kind of retreat.
He said nothing about his plans or his cabinet appointments, He even re~
fused to meet the sitting president, Herbert Hoover, to discuss the transi-
tion. By the time of Roosevelt’s inauguration the country was in a state of

high anxiety.
    In his inaugural address, Roosevelt shifted gears. He made a powerful

speech, making it clear that he intended to lead the country in a completely
new direction,
               sweeping away the timid gestures of his predecessors. From
then on the pace of his speeches and public decisions——cabinet appoint-
ments, bold legislatiori—~unfolded at an incredibly rapid rate. The period
after the inauguration became known as the “Hundred Days,” and its suc-
      altering the country’s mood partly stemmed from Roosevelfs clever
cess in

pacing and use of dramatic contrast. He held his audience in suspense,
then hit them with a series of bold gestures that seemed all the more mo-
mentous because    they came from nowhere. You must learn to orchestrate
events in a similar manner, never revealing all your cards at once, but un-
folding them in a
                  way that heightens their dramatic effect.
    Besides covering a multitude of sins, good drama can also confuse and
deceive your enemy. During World War II, the German playwright Bertolt
Brecht worked in Hollywood as a screenwriter. After the war he was called
before the House Committee on Un-American Activities for his supposed
Communist      sympathies. Other writers who had been called to testify
planned   tohumiliate the committee members with an angry emotional
stand. Brecht was wiser: He would play the committee like a violin, charmv
ing them while fooling them as well. He carefully rehearsed his responses,
and brought along some props, notably a cigar on which he puffed away,
knowing the head of the committee hked cigars. And indeed he proceeded

                                                                               LAW 25   197
               to beguile the committee with well—crafted responses that were     ambiguous,
               funny, and double—edged. Instead of an angry, heartfelt tirade, he ran cir-
               cles around them with a staged production, and they let him off scot-free.
                     Other dramatic effects for your repertoire include the beau geste, an
               action at a climactic moment that symbolizes your triumph or your bold-
               ness. Caesar’s dramatic
                                          crossing of the Rubicon was a beau geste——a move
               that dazzled the soldiers and gave him heroic proportions. You must also
               appreciate the importance of stage entrances and exits. When Cleopatra
               first met Caesar in Egypt, she arrived rolled up in a carpet, which she

               arranged to have unfurled at his feet. George Washington twice left power
               with flourish and fanfare (first as a general, then as a president who refused
               to sit for a third term), showing he knew how to make the moment count,

               dramatically and symbolically. Your own entrances and exits should be
               crafied and planned as carefully.
                     Remember that overacting can be counte1productive—it is another

               way of spending too much effort trying to attract attention. The actor
               Richard Burton discovered early in his career that by standing totally still
               onstage, he drew attention to himself and away from the other actors. It is
               less what you do that matters, clearly, than how you do it—your graceful-
               ness and
                        imposing stillness on the social stage count for more than overdo»
               ing your part and moving around too much.
                   Finally: Learn to play many roles, to be whatever the moment re»
               quires. Adapt your mask to the situation-be protean in the faces you wear.
               Bismarck played this game to perfection: To a liberal he was a liberal, to a
               hawk he was     a   hawk. He could not be grasped, and what cannot be
               grasped cannot be consumed.

               everyone, for like attracts like. Take note of temperaments and adapt your
               self to that of each person you meet—follow the lead of the serious and

               jovial in turn, changing your mood discreetly. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658)

There can really be no reversal to this critical law: Bad theater is bad the-

dramatic—avoid the histfionic gesture. But that is simply bad theater any-
way, since it violates centuries-old dramatic laws against overacting. In
essence there is no reversal to this law.

Ts’ao Ts’ao came to power in an extremely tumultuous time. In the struggle         1948

for supremacy in the crumbling Han Empire, enemies had emerged from
all sides. The battle for the Central Plain had proven more difficult than he
imagined, and money and provisions were a constant concern. No wonder
that under such stress, he had forgotten to order supplies in time.
     Once it became clear that the delay wa.s a critical mistake, and that the
army was seething with mutiny, Ts’ao 'Is’ao had two options: apology and
excuses, or a scapegoat. Understanding the workings of power and the im—

               portance of appearances as he did, Ts’ao Ts’ao did not hesitate for a mo-
               ment: He   shopped around for the most convenient head and had it served
               up immediately.
                     Occasional mistakes      are   inevitable——the world is just      too    nnpre
               diciable. People of power, however. are undone not by the mistakes they
               make, but by the way they deal with them. Like surgeons, they must cut
               away the tumor with speed and finality. Excuses and apologies are much
               tooblunt tools for this delicate operation; the powerful avoid them. By
               apologizing you open up all sorts of doubts about your competence, your
               intentions, any other mistakes you may not have confessed. Excuses satisfy
               no one   and apologies make everyone uncomfortable. The mistake does
               not vanish with an    apology; it deepens and testers. Better to cut it off in-
               stantly, distract attention from yourself, and focus attention on a conve

               OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 11
               For several years Cesare Borgia campaigned to gain control of large parts
               of Italy in the name of his father, Pope Alexander. In the year I500 he

               managed to take Romagna, in northern Italy. The region had for years
               been ruled by a series of greedy masters who had plundered its wealth for
               themselves. Without police or any disciplining force, it had descended into
               lawlessness, whole areas being ruled by robbers and feuding families.
               To establish order, Cesare appointed a lieutenant general of the region-—
               Remixro    de Oreo, “a cruel and vigorous man,” according to Niccolo
               Machiavelli. Cesare gave the Orco absolute powers.
                     With energy and violence, de Orco established a severe, brutal justice
               in Rornagna, and soon rid it of almost all of its lawless elements. But in his
               zeal he sometimes went too far, and after a couple of years the local popu-
               lation resented and even hated him. In December of 1502, Cesare took dc»
               cisive action. He first let it be known that he had not approved of de Orco’s
               cruel and violent deeds, which stemmed from the lieutenanfs brutal na-
               ture. Then, on December 22, he           imprisoned cle Drco in the town of Ce-
               sena, and the day after Christmas the townspeople awoke to find a strange

               spectacle in the middle of the piazza: do Orco’s headless body, dressed in a
               lavish suit with a purple cape, the head impaled beside it on a pike, the
               bloody knife and executioner’s block laid out beside the head. As Machi-
               avelli concluded his comments on the affair, “The ferocity of this scene left
               the people at once stunned and satisfied.”


               Interpretation
               Cesare Borgia was a master player in the game of power. Always planning
               several moves ahead, he set his opponents the cleverest traps. For this
               Machiavelli honored him above all others in The Prince.

202   LAW 20
       Cesare foresaw the future with amazing clarity in Romagna‘. Only bru-
tal justice would bring order to the region. The process would take several

years, and at first the people would welcome it. But it would soon make
many enemies, and the citizens would come to resent the imposition of
such    unforgiving justice, especially by outsiders. Cesare himself, then,
could not be seen as the agent of this justice-—the people’s hatred would
cause too
          many problems in the future. And so he chose the one man who
could do the dirty work, knowing in advance that once the task was done
he would have to display de Orco’s head on a pike. The scapegoat in this
case had been
                 planned from the beginning.
       With Ts’ao Ts’ao, the scapegoat was an entirely innocent man; in the
Romagna, he was the offensive weapon in Cesare’s arsenal that let him get
the dirty work done without bloodying his own hands. With this second
kind of scapegoat it is wise to separate yourself from the hatchet man at
some point, either leaving him
                                dangling in the wind or, like Cesare, even
making yourself the one to bring him to justice. Not only are you free of in-
volvement in the problem, you can appear as the one who cleaned it up.

               The Golden Bough. Sirjames Gemge Frazer, 1854-19-71




KEYS TO POWER
The use of scapegoats is as old as civilization itself, and examples of it can
be found in cultures around the world. The main idea behind these sacri-
fices is the shifting of guilt and sin to an outside fig'ure—object, animal, or
man—which is then banished or destroyed. The Hebrews used to take a
live goat (hence the term “scapegoat”) upon whose head the priest would
lay both hands while confessing the sins of the Children of Israel. Having
thus had those sins transferred to it, the beast would be led away and aban-
doned in the wilderness. With the Athenians and the Aztecs, the scapegoat
was human, often a person fed and raised for the purpose. Since famine
and plague were thought to be visited on humans by the gods, in punish‘
ment for    wrongdoing, the people suffered not only from the famine and
plague themselves but from blame and guilt. They freed themselves of guilt
by transferring it to an innocent person, whose death was intended to sat-
isfy the divine powers and banish the evil from their midst.
      It is an extremely human response to not look inward after a mistake
or   crime, but rather to look outward and to affix blame and guilt on a con-
venient object. When the plague was                ravaging Thebes, Oedipus looked
everywhere for its cause, everywhere except inside himself and his own sin
of incest, which had so offended the gods and occasioned the plague. This
profound need to exteriorize one’s guilt, to project it on another person or
object, has an immense power, which the clever know how to harness. Sar-
                                                                                         LAW 26   203
                rifice is a ritual, perhaps the most ancient ritual of all; ritual too is a well-

                spring of power. In the killing of de Orco, note Cesa.re’s symbolic and ritu-
                alistic display of his body. By framing it in this dramatic way he focused
                guilt outward The citizens of Romagna responded instantly. Because it
                comes so naturally to us to look outward rather than inward, we readily ac~


                cept the scapegoat’s guilt.
                     The bloody sacrifice of the scapegoat seems a barbaric relic of the

                past, but the practice lives on to this day, if indirectly and symbolically;
                since power depends on appearances, and those in power must seem never
                to make mistakes, the use of scapegoats is as popular as ever. What modern

                leader will take responsibility for his blunders? He searches out others
                to blame, a scapegoat to sacrifice. When Mao Tse-tung’s Cultural Rev—

                olution failed miserably, he made no apologies or excuses to the Chinese

                people; instead, like Ts’ao Ts’ao before him, he offered up scapegoats, in»
                cluding his own personal secretary and higlrranking member of the Party,
                Ch ’en Po-ta.
                     Franklin D. Roosevelt had a reputation for honesty and fairness.

                Throughout his career, however, he faced many situations in which being
                the nice guy would have spelled political d.isaster—yet he could not be
                seen as the
                              agent of any foul play. For twenty years, then, his secretary,
                Louis Howe, played the role de Orco had. He handled the backroom deals,
                the manipulation of the press, the underhandecl campaign maneuvers. And
                whenever a mistake was committed, or a dirty trick contradicting Roo-
                sevelt’s carefully crafted image became public, Howe served as the scape-
                goat, and never complained.
                     Besides conveniently shifting blame, a scapegoat can serve as a warn-
                ing to  others. In 1631 a plot was hatched to oust France’s Cardinal Riche-
                lieu from power, a plot that became known as “The Day of the Dupes.” It
                almost succeeded, since it involved the upper echelons of government, in«

                cluding the queen mother. But through luck and his own connivances,
                Richelieu survived.
                    One of the key conspirators was a man named Marillac, the keeper of
                the seals. Richelieu could not imprison him without implicating the queen
                mother, an extremely dangerous tactic, so he targeted Marillac’s brother, a
                marshal in the army. This man had no involvement in the plot. Richelieu,
                however, afraid that other conspiracies might be in the air, especially in the
                army, decided to set an example. He tried the brother on trurnped«up
                charges and had him executed. In this way he indirectly punished the real
                perpetrator, who had thought himself protected, and warned any future
                conspirators that he would not shrink from sacrificing the innocent to pro-
                tect his own power.
                                                                   '




                    In fact it is often wise to choose the most innocent victim possible as a
                sacrificial goat. Such people will not be powerful enough to fight you, and
                their naive protests may be seen as protesting too much—may be seen, in
                other words, as a sign of their guilt. Be careful, however, not to create a

                martyr. It is important that ytm remain the victim, the poor leader betrayed


204   LAW 20‘
by the incompetence of those around you. If the scapegoat appears too
weak and his punishment too cruel, you may end up the victim of your
own device. Sometimes
                         you should find a more powerful scapegoatm-one
who will elicit less sympathy in the long run.
    In this vein, history has time and again shown the value of using a
close associate as a scapegoat. This is known as the “fall of the favorite.”
Most kings had a personal favorite at court, a man whom they singled out,
sometimes for no apparent reason, and lavished with favors and attention.
But this court favorite could serve as at convenient scapegoat in case of a
threat to the king’s reputation. The public would readily believe in the
scapegoat’s guilt-—why would the king sacrifice his favorite unless he were
guilty? And the other couxtiers, resendul of the favorite anyway, would re-
joice at his downfall. The king, meanwhile, would rid himself of a man who
by that time had probably learned too much about him, perhaps becoming
arrogant and even disdainful of him. Choosing a close associate as a scape-
goat has the same value as the “fall of the favorite.” You may lose a friend
or aide, but in the
                    long—term scheme of things, it is more important to hide
your  mistakes  than  to hold on to someone who one day will probably turn

against you. Besides, you can always find a. new favorite to take his place.

Most leaders who had taken as powerful an enemy as Chiang Kai-shek

have lost the chance Mao exploited. Without the experienced Chiang as
leader of the Nationalists, the fight to drive the Japanese out might have
lasted much longer, with devastating results. Mao was far too clever to let
anger spoil the chance to kill two birds with one stone. In essence, Mao          A l'(>0|. A\lJ \ V Ihli MM

      On the eve of an important river battle, the great third—century Chi
nese   strategist Chuko Liang found himself falsely accused of secretly work
ing for the other side. As proof of his loyalty, his commander ordered him
toproduce 100,000 arrows for the army within three days, or be put to
death. Instead of trying to manufacture the arrows, an impossible task,
Liang took a dozen boats and had bundles of straw lashed to their sides. In
the late afternoon, when mist always blanketed the river, he floated the
boats toward the enemy camp. Fearing a trap from the wily Chuko Liang,
the enemy did not attack the barely visible boats with boats of their own,

                                             but showered them with arrows from the bank. As Liang’s boats inched
                                             closer, they redoubled the rain of arrows, which stuck in the thick straw.

    Finally, you may well find cases in which deliberately offering yourself
as thecat’s-paw will ultimately gain you great power. This is the ruse of the
perfect courtier. Its symbol is Sir Walter Raleigh, who once placed his own
cloak on the muddy ground so that Queen Elizabeth would not sully her
shoes. As the instrument that protects a master or peer from unpleasant
ness or danger,
                  you gain immense respect, which sooner or later will pay
dividends. And remember: If you can make your assistance subtle and gra—
cious rather than boastful and burdensome, your recompense will be that
much the more satisfying and powerful.

               REVERSAI.
               The cat’s~paw and the scapegoat must be used with extreme caution and
               delicacy. They are like screens that hide your own involvement in dirty
               work from the public; if at any moment the screen is lifted and you are
               seen as the
                             manipulator, the puppet master, the whole dynamic aims
               around—your hand will be seen everywhere, and you will be blamed for
               misfortunes you may have had nothing to do with. Once the truth is re
               vealed, events will snowball beyond your control.
                    In 1572, Queen Catherine de’ Médicis of France conspired to do away
               with Gaspard de Coligny, an admiral in the French navy and a leading
               member of the Huguenot (French Protestant) community. Coliguy was
               close to Catherine’s son, Charles IX, and she feared his growing influence
               on the young
                                king. So she arranged for a member of the Guise family, one
               of the most powerful royal clans in France, to assassinate him.
                   Secretly, however, Catherine had another plan: She Wanted the Hu-
               guenots to blame the Guises for killing one of their leaders, and to take re
               venge. With one blow, she would erase or injure two threatening rivals,
               Coligny and the Guise family. Yet both plans went awry. The assassin
               missed his target, only wounding Coligny; knowing Catherine as his
               enemy, he strongly suspected it was she who had set up the attack on him,
               and he told the king so. Eventually the failed assassination and the argu-
               ments that ensued from it set off a chain of events that led to a bloody civil
               war between Catholics and Protestants, culminating in the
                                                                             horrifying Mas
               sacre     of St. Bartholomew’s Eve, in which thousands of Protestants were
               killed.
                     If you have to use a cat’s—paw or a scapegoat in an action of great con-

               sequence, be very careful: Too much can go wrong. It is often wiser to use
               such dupes in more innocent endeavors, where mistakes or miscalculations
               will cause no serious harm.

                     Finally, there are moments when it is advantageous to not disguise
               your involvement or responsibility, but rather to take the blame yourself
               for some mistake. If you have power and are secure in it, you should some
               times play the penitent: With a sorrowful look, you ask for forgiveness
               from those weaker than you. It is the ploy of the king who makes a show of
               his own sacrifices for the good of the people. Similarly, upon occasion you
               may want to appear as the agent of punishment in order to instill fear and
               trembling in your subordinates. Instead of the ca.t‘s~paw you show your
               own
                    mighty hand as a threatening gesture. Play such a card sparingly. If
               you play it too often, fear will turn into resentment and hatred. Before you
               know it, such emotions will spark a vigorous opposition that will someday
               bring you down. Get in the habit of using a cat’s-paw——it is far safer.

                                   Mesmer thus passed from being a confirmed advocate of magnetism
                              tn the role of a charlatan using every trick in the book to captivate the pub-
lie. The biggest trick of all was to play on the repressed sexuality that bub-
bles under the surface of any group setting. In a group, a longing for social
unity, a longing older than civilization, cries out to be awakened. This de~
sire may be subsumed under a unifying cause, but beneath it is a repressed

sexuality that the charlatan knows how to exploit and manipulate for his
own
      purposes.
      This is the lesson that Mesmer teaches us: Our tendency to doubt, the
distance that allows us to reason, is broken down when we join a group.
The warmth and infectiousness of the group overwhelm the skeptical indi-
vidual. This is the power you gain by creating a cult. Also, by playing on
people’s repressed sexuality, you lead them into mistaking their excited
feelings for signs of your mystical strength. You gain untold power by
working on people’s unrealized desire for a. kind of promiscuous and
pagan unity.
    Remember too that the most effective cults mix religion with science.
Take the latest technological trend or fad and blend it with a noble cause, a
mystical faith, a new form of healing. People’s interpretations of your hy—
brid cult will run rampant, and they will attribute powers to you that you
had never even thought to claim.

R EVE RSAL
One reason to create a following is that a group is often easier to deceive
than an individual, and turns over to you that much more power. This
comes, however, with a danger: If at any moment the group sees through

you, you will find yourself facing not one deceived Soul but an angry crowd
that will tear you to pieces as avidly as it once followed you. The Charlatans

constantly faced this danger, and were always ready to move out of town as
it inevitably became clear that their elixirs did not work and their ideas
were sham. Too slow and
                             they paid with their lives. In playing with the
crowd, you are playing with fire, and must constantly keep an eye out for
any sparks of doubt, any enemies who will turn the crowd against you.
When you play with the emotions of a crowd, you have to know how to
adapt, attuning yourself instantaneously to all of the moods and desires that
a
   group will produce. Use spies, be on top of everything, and keep your
bags packed.
     For this reason you may often prefer to deal with people one by one.

Isolating them from their normal milieu can have the same effect as putting
them in a group—it makes them more prone to suggestion and intimida-
tion. Choose the right sucker and if he eventually sees through you he may

prove easier to escape than a crowd.

2.94          LAW 2 B
REVE RS/\L
Boldness should never be the strategy behind all of your actions. It is a tac-
tical instrument, to be used at the right moment. Plan and think ahead, and
make the final element the bold move that will bring you success. In other
words, since boldness is a learned response, it is also one that you leam to
control and utilize at will. To go through life armed only with audacity
would be tiring and also fatal. You would offend too many people, as is
proven by those who cannot control their boldness, One such person was
Lola Montez; her audacity brought her triumphs and led to her seduction
of the king of Baxfatia. But since she could never rein in her boldness, it
also led to her downfall—-in Bavaria, in England, wherever she turned. It
crossed the border between boldness and the appearance of cruelty, even
insanity. Ivan the Terrible suffered the same fate: When the power of bold-
ness brought him success, he stuck to it, to the point where it became a life

long pattern of violence and sadism. He lost the ability to tell when
boldness was appropriate and when it was not.
   Timidity has no place in the realm of power; you will often benefit,
however, by being able to feign it. At that point, of course, it is no longer
iimidity but an offensive weapon: You are luring people in with your show
of shyness, all the better to pounce on them boldly later.

adventurers to come in search of Colurnbus’s land of gold, and he had de-
cided from the beginning that he would be the one to find it, through
sheer audacity and single—mindedness. Now that he was free of his credi-

name that to his ears sounded like “Biru.” Balboa decided he would cross

the treacherous jungles of Panama and become the first European to bathe
his feet in this new ocean. From there he would march on El Dorado. If he
did this on Spain’s behalf, he would obtain the eternal gratitude of the
king, and would secure his own reprieve—-only he had to act before Span-

                                indeed, three years later Bismarck provoked a war with France. First he
                                appeared to give his permission to France’s annexation of Belgium, then
                                at the last moment he changed his mind. Playing a caband-mouse game,
                                he infuriated the French emperor, Napoleon Ill, and stirred up his own
                                king against the French. To no one’s surprise, war broke out in 1870. The
                                newly formed German federation enthusiastically joined in the war
                                on France, and once again the Prussian military machine and its allies

                                destroyed the enemy army in a matter of months. Although Bismarck
                                opposed taking any French land, the generals convinced him that Alsace-
                                Lorraine would become part of the federation.
                                    Now all of Europe feared the next move of the Prussian monster, led

                                by Bismarck, the “Iron Chancellor.” And in fact a year later Bismarck
                                founded the German       Empire, with the Prussian king as the newly
                                crowned emperor and Bismarck himself a prince. But then something
                                strange happened: Bismarck instigated no more wars. And while the other
                                European powers grabbed up land for colonies in other continents, he se-
                                verely limited Germany’s colonial acquisitions. He did not want more
                                land for Germany, but more security. For the rest of his life he struggled to
                                maintain peace in Europe and to prevent further wars. Everybody as-

                                Interpretation
                                There is a simple reason why most men never know when to come off the
                                attack: They form no concrete idea of their goal. Once they achieve vic-
                                tory they only hunger for more. To stop-—to aim for a goal and then keep
                                to it——seems almost inhuman, in fact; yet nothing is more critical to the
                                maintenance of power. The person who goes too far in his triumphs cre-
                                ates a reaction that inevitably leads to a decline. The only solution is to

                                plan for the long run. Foresee the future with as much clarity as the gods
                                on Mount Olympus, who look through the clouds and see the ends of all

                                things.
                                     From the beginning of his career in polifics, Bismarck had one goal:
                                to form an independent German state led by Prussia. He instigated the
                                war with Denmark not to
                                                          conquer territory but to stir up Prussian nation-
                                alism and unite the country. He incited the war with Austiia only to gain



240       LAW 29
Prussian independence. (This was why he refused to grab Austrian terri-
tory.) And he fomented the war with France to unite the German king-
doms against a common enemy, and thus to prepare for the formation of a
united Germany.
   Once this was achieved, Bismarck stopped. He never let triumph go
to his head, was never tempted by the siren call of more. He held the rei.ns

tightly, and whenever the generals, or the king, or the Prussian people de-
manded new conquests, he held them back. Nothing would spoil the
beauty of his creation, certainly not a false euphoria that pushed those
around him to attempt to go past the end that he had so carefully planned.


     Experience shows that, if anef0Teset4.9_f1“amfaT away the designs to be
  undertaken, one can act with speed when the moment comes to execute them.

KEYS TO POWER
According to the cosmology of the ancient Greeks, the gods were thought
to have complete vision into the future. They saw everything to come,

right down to the intricate details. Men, on the other hand, were seen as
victims of fate, trapped in the moment and their emotions, unable to see

beyond immediate dangers. Those heroes, such as Odysseus, who were
able to look beyond the present and plan several steps ahead, seemed to
defy fate, to approximate the gods in their ability to determine the future.
The comparison is still va.1id—those among us who think further ahead
and patiently bring their plans to fruition seem to have a godlike power.
   Because most people are too imprisoned in the moment to plan with
this kind of foresight, the ability to ignore immediate dangers and plea-
                  power. It is the power of being able to overcome the
sures translates into

natural human tendency to react to things as they happen, and instead to
train oneself to step back, imagining the larger things taking shape beyond
one’s immediate vision. Most people believe that they are in fact aware of
the future, that they are planning and thinking ahead. They are usually de-
luded: What they are really doing is succumbing to their desires, to what
they want the future to be. Their plans are vague, based on their imagina-
tions rather than their reality. They may believe they are thinking all the
way to the end, but they are really only focusing on the happy ending, and
deluding themselves by the strength of their desire.
     In 415 B.C., the ancient Athenians attacked Sicily, believing their ex-

pedition would bring them riches, power, and a glorious ending to the six-
teen-year Peloponnesian War. They did not consider the dangers of an
invasion so far from home; they did not foresee that the Sicilians would

light all the harder since the battles were in their own homeland, or that
all of Athens’s enemies would band together against them, or that war
would break out on several fronts, stretching their forces way too thin.
The Sicilian expedition was a complete disaster, leading to the destruction


                                                                               LAW 2!)   .24!
of one of the greatest civilizations of all time. The Athenians were led into
this disaster by their hearts, not their minds. They saw only the chance of
glory, not the dangers that loomed in the distance.
     Cardinal de Retz, the seventeenth-century Frenchman who prided
himself on his insights into human schemes and why they mostly fail, ana-

lyzed this phenomenon. In the course of a rebellion he spearheaded
against the French monarchy in 1651, the young king, Louis XIV, and his
court had suddenly left Paris and established themselves in a palace out-
side the capital. The presence of the king so close to the heart of the revo-
lution had been a tremendous burden on the revolutionaries, and they
breathed a sigh of relief. This later proved their downfall, however, since
the court’s absence from Paris gave it much more room to maneuver.
“The most ordinary cause of people’s mistakes,” Cardinal de Retz later
wrote, “is their being too much frightened at the present danger, and not
enough so at that which is remote.”
       The dangers that are remote, that loom in the distance-—if we can see
them as they take shape, how many mistakes we avoid. How many plans
we would instantly abort if we realized we were avoiding a small danger
only to step into a larger one. So much of power is not what you do but
what you do not do——the rash and foolish actions that you refrain from be-
fore they get you into trouble. Plan in detail before you act—do not let

vague   plans lead you into trouble. Will this have unintended conse-
quences? Will I stir up new enemies? Will someone else take advantage of
my labors? Unhappy endings are much more common than happy
ones——do not be swayed by the happy ending in your mind.
     The French elections of 1848 came down to a struggle between Louis-
Adolphe Thiers, the man of order, and General Louis Eugene Cavaignac,
the rabble-rouser of the right When Thiers realized he was hopelessly be-
hind in this high—stakes race, he searched desperately for a solution. His
eye fell on Louis Bonaparte, grand-nephew of the great general Napoleon,
and a lowly deputy in the parliament. This Bonaparte seemed a bit of an
imbecile, but his name alone could get him elected in a country yearning
for a strong ruler. He would be Thiers’s puppet and eventually would be

pushed offstage. The first part of the plan worked to perfection, and
Napoleon was elected by a large margin. The problem was that Thiers
had not foreseen one simple fact: This “imbecile” was in fact a man of
enormous ambition. Three
                             years later he dissolved parliament, declared
himself emperor, and ruled France for another eighteen years, much to
the horror of Thiers and his party.
       The ending is everything. It is the end of the action that determines
who gets the glory, the money, the prize. Your conclusion must be crystal
clear, and you must keep it constantly in mind. You must also figure out
how to ward off the vultures circling overhead, trying to live off the car-
cass of your creation. And you must anticipate the many possible crises
that will tempt you to improvise. Bismarck overcame these dangers be-
cause he
           planned to the end, kept on course through every crisis, and
never   let others steal the glory. Once he had reached his stated goal, he
withdrew into his shell like a turtle. This kind of selfcontrol is godlike.
   When you see several steps ahead, and plan your moves all the way
to the end, you will no longer be tempted by emotion or by the desire to

improvise. Your clarity will rid you of the anxiety and vagueness that are
the primary reasons why so many fail to conclude their actions success-

fully. You see the ending and you tolerate no deviation.

               REVERSAL
               It is a cliché among strategists that your plan must include alternatives and
               have a degree of flexibility. T hat is certainly true. If you are locked into a
               plan too rigidly, you will be unable to deal with sudden shifts of fortune.
               Once you have examined the future possibilities and decided on your tar-
               get, you must build in alternatives and be open to new routes toward your
               goal.
                   Most people, however, lose less from overplanning and rigidity than
               from vagueness and a tendency to improvise constantly in the face of Ci1‘~
               cumstance. There is no real purpose in contemplating a reversal to this

               Law, then, for no good can come from refusing to think far into the future
               and planning to the end. If you are clear and fapthinking enough, you
               will understand that the future is uncertain, and that you must be open to

               adaptation. Only having 3. clear objective and a far-reaching plan allows
               you that freedom.

          R.G. H. 511:, 1979             Over the years, Houdini escaped from the chained carcass of an em
                                    balmed “sea monster” (3. half octopus, half whalelike beast that had
                                    beached near Boston); he had himself sealed inside an enormous envelope
                                    from which he emerged without breaking the paper; he passed through
                                    brick walls; he wriggled free from straitjackets while dangling high in the
                                    air; he leaped from bridges into icy waters, his hands manacled and his legs
                                    in chains; he had himself submerged in glass cases full of water, hands pad-
                                    locked, while the audience watched in amazement as he worked himself
                                    free, struggling for close to an hour apparently without breathing. Each
                                    time he seemed to court certain death yet survived with superhuman

                                    aplomb. Meanwhile, he said nothing about his methods, gave no clues as
                                    to how be  accomplished any of his tricks——~he left his audiences and critics
                                    speculating, his power and reputation enhanced by their struggles with the
                                    inexplicable. Perhaps the most baffling trick of all was making a ten—thou-
                                    sa.ud—pound elephant disappear before an audience’s eyes, a feat he re
                                    peated on stage for over nineteen weeks. No one has ever really explained
                                    how he did this, for in the auditorium where he performed the trick, there
                                    was
                                         simply nowhere for an elephant to hide.
                                         The effortlessness of Houdin1"s escapes led some to think he used oc-
                                    cult forces, his superior psychic abilities giving him special control over his
                                    body. But a German escape artist named Kleppini claimed to know Hon»

                                    have defeated Houdini in a handcuff challenge in Holland.
                                         Houdini did not mind all kinds of speculation floating around about

plished this uncanny feat.

Interpretation
Although we do not know for certain how Houdini accomplished many of
his most ingenious escapes, one thing is clear: It was not the occult, or any
kind of magic, that gave him his powers, but hard work and endless prac-
tice, all of which he carefully concealed from the world. Houdini never left
anything to chance-—-day and night he studied the workings of locks, re-
searched centuries-old sleight—of-hand tricks, pored over books on mechan
ics, whatever he could use. Every moment not spent researching he spent
working his body, keeping himself exceptionally limher, and learning how
to control his muscles and his breathing.

     Early on in Houdini’s career, an old Japanese performer whom he
toured with taught him an ancient trick: how to swallow an ivory ball, then
bring it back up. He practiced this endlessly with a small peeled potato tied
to a string—up and down he would manipulate the potato with his throat

muscles, until they were strong enough to move it without the string. The
organizers of the London handcuff challenge had searched Houdini’s body
thoroughly beforehand, but no one could check the inside of his throat,
where he could have concealed small tools to help him escape. Even so,
Kleppini was fundamentally wrong: It was not Houdini’s tools but his prac-
tice, work, and research that made his escapes possible.
      Kleppini, in fact, was completely outwitted by Houdini, who set the
whole thing up. He let his opponent learn the code to the French cuffs,



                                                                                          LAW 30        249
                   then baited him into choosing those cuffs onstage. Then, during the two
                   men’s tussle, the dexterous Houdini was able to change the code to “ER-
                   AvU-D.” He had spent weeks practicing this trick, but the audience saw
                   none   of the sweat and toil behind the scenes. Nor was Houdini ever ner-
                   vous; he induced nervousness in others.      (He deliberately dragged out the
                   time it would take to escape, as a way of heightening the drama, and mak-

                   ing the audience squirm.) His escapes from death, always graceful and
                   easy, made him look like a superman.
                       As a person of power, you must research and practice endlessly before

                   appearing in public, onstage or anywhere else. Never expose the sweat and
                   labor behind your poise. Some think such exposure will demonstrate their
                   diligence and honesty, but it actually just makes them look weaker-—as if
                   anyone who practiced and worked at it could do what they had done, or as
                   if they weren’t really up to the job. Keep your effort and your tricks to
                   yourself and you seem to have the grace and ease of a. god. One never sees
                   the source of a god’s power revealed; one only sees its effects.

                   KEYS TO POWER
                   Humanity‘s first notions of power came from primitive encounters with na-
                   ture-—the flash of lightning in the sky, a sudden flood, the speed and feroc
                   ity of a wild animal. These forces required no thinking, no planning—they
                   awed us by their sudden appearance, their gracefulness, and their power
                   over life and death. And this remains the kind of
                                                                         power we have always
                   wanted to imitate. Through science and technology we have recreated the
                   speed and sublime power of nature, but something is missing: Our ma~
                   chines are noisy and jerky, they reveal their effort. Even the very best cre-
                   ations of technology cannot root out our admiration for things that move

                   easily and effortlessly. The power of children to bend us to their will comes
                   from a kind of seductive charm that we feel in the presence‘ of a creature
                   less reflective and more graceful than we are. We cannot retum to such a
                   state, but if we can create the appearance of this kind of ease, we elicit in
                   others the kind of primitive awe that nature has always evoked in hu-
                   mankind.
                       One of the first European writers to expound on this principle came
                   from that most unnatural of environments, the Renaissance court. In 771:
                   Book of the Courtier, published in 1528, Baldassare Castiglione describes the
                   highly elaborate and codified manners of the perfect court citizen. And yet,
                   Castiglione explains, the courtier must execute these gestures with what he
                   calls .r[mzz,zatu1a, the capacity to make the difficult seem easy. He urges the
                   courtier to “practice in all things a certain nonchalance which conceals all



250   .   LAW 30
artistry and makes whatever one says or does seem uncontrived and effort-
less.” We all admire the achievement of some unusual feat, but if it is ac-
complished naturally and gracefully, our admiration increases tenfold-—
“whereas   .   .   .   to labor at what one is doing and   .   .   .   to make bones over it,
shows an extreme lack of grace and causes everything, whatever its worth,
to be discounted.”
    Much of the idea of sprezzalura came from the world of art. All the

great Renaissance artists carefully kept their works under wraps. Only the
finished masterpiece could be shown to the public. Michelangelo forbade
even popes to view his work in process. A Renaissance artist was always
careful to keep his studios shut to patrons and public alike, not out of fear
of imitation, but because to see the making of the works would mar the
magic of their effect, and their studied atmosphere of ease and natural
beauty.
    The Renaissance painter Vasari, also the first great art critic, ridiculed
the work of Paolo Uccello, who was obsessed with the laws of perspective.
The elfort Uccello spent on improving the appearance of perspective was
too obvious in his work——it made his paintings ugly and labored, over-
whelmed by the elicit of their effects. We have the same response when we
watch performers who put too much effort into their act: Seeing them try-
ing so hard breaks the illusion. It also makes us uncomfortable. Calm,
graceful performers, on the other hand, set us at ease, creating the illusion
that they are not acting but being natural and themselves, even when

everything they are doing involves labor and practice.
    The idea of sprewztum is relevant to all forms of power, for power
depends vitally on appearances and the illusions you create. Your public
actions are like artworks: They must have visual appeal, must create antici»

pation, even entertain. When you reveal the inner workings of your cre—
ation, you become just one more mortal among others. What is
understandable is not awe-inspiring-—we tell ourselves we could do as well
if we had the money and time. Avoid the               temptation of showing how
clever you are-—it is far more clever to conceal the mechanisms of your
cleverness.
    Talleyrand’s application of this concept to his daily life greatly en»
hanced the aura of power that surrounded him. He never liked to work too
hard, so he made others do the work for hirn—-the spying, the research, the
detailed analyses. With all this labor at his disposal, he himself never
seemed to strain. VVhen his spies revealed that a certain event was about to
take place, he would talk in social conversation as if he sensed its immi-
nence.   The result was that people thought he was clairvoyant. His short
pithy  statements and witticismsalways seemed to summarize a situation
perfectly, but they were based on much research and thought. '13:: those in

government, including Napoleon himself, Talleyrand gave the impression
of immense power—an effect entirely dependent on the apparent ease
with which he accomplished his feats.
    There is another reason for concealing your shortcuts and tricks:


                                                                                                LAW 30   251
                   When you let this information out, you give people ideas they can use
                   against you. You lose the advantages of keeping silent. We tend to want the
                   world to know what we have done--we want our vanity gratified by hay»
                   ing our hard work and cleverness applauded, and we may even want sym—
                   pathy for the hours it has taken to reach our point of artistry. Learn to
                   control this propensity to blab, for its effect is often the opposite of what

                   you expected. Remember: The more mystery surrounds your actions, the
                   more awesome
                                  your power seems, You appear to be the only one who can
                   do what you do--and the appearance of having an exclusive               is im-

                   mensely powerful. Finally, because you achieve your accomplishments
                   with grace and ease, people believe that you could always do more if you
                   tried harder. This elicits not only admiration but a touch of fear. Your pow-

                   spent the last years of his life hiding his frescoes from the public eye and

wanted to feel involved in his shows, and that understanding his tricks de-
lighted them, partly, perhaps, because implicitly debunking people who
kept their sources of power hidden from the masses appealed to Ametica’s
democratic spirit. The public also appreciated the showman’s humor and
honesty. Barnum took this to the extreme of publicizing his own humbug—
gery in his popular autobiogzaphy, written when his career was at its
height.
     As long as the partial disclosure of tricks and techniques is carefully

planned, rather than the result of an uncontrollable need to blab, it is the
ultimate in cleverness. It gives the audience the illusion of being superior
and involved, even while much of what you do remains concealed from
them.

court boarded the sleds and left town. Without explaining why, he estab-
lished himself in a village south of Moscow. For an entire month a kind of
terror   gripped the capital, for the Muscovites feared that Ivan had aban-
doned them to the bloodthirsty boyars. Shops closed up and riotous mobs
gathered daily. Finally, on January 3 of 1565, a. letter arrived from the czar,
explaining that he could no longer bear the boyars’ betrayals and had do
cided to abdicate once and for all.
       Read aloud in public, the letter had a startling effect: Merchants and
commoners blamed the
                          boyars for Ivan’s decision, and took to the streets,
terrifying the nobility with their fury. Soon a group of delegates represent-

ing the church, the princes, and the people made the journey to Ivan’s vil-
lage, and begged the czar, in the name of the holy land of Russia, to return
to the throne. Ivan listened but would not change his mind. After days of

hearing their pleas, however, he offered his subjects a choice: Either they
grant him absolute powers to govern as he pleased, with no interference
from the boyars, or they find a new leader.
     Faced with a choice between civil war and the acceptance of despotic
power, almost every sector of Russian society “opted” for a strong czar,
calling for Ivan’s return to Moscow and the restoration of law and order. In

                                                                                               LAW 3!                255

the object of intense hostility. Her reversal of the position of the courtesan
scandalized the queen mother and her court. Much to their horror, how-
ever, it did not discourage her male suitors—indeed it only increased their
numbers and intensified their desire, It became an honor to be a payeur,
helping Ninon to maintain her lifestyle and her glittering salon, accompa-
nying her sometimes to the theater, and sleeping with her when she chose.
Even more distinguished were the martyrs, enjoying her company without

paying for it and maintaining the hope, however remote, of some day be-
coming her fizvorz‘. That possibility spurred on many a young nobleman, as
word spread that none among the courtesans could surpass Ninon in the
art of love. And so the married and the single, the old and the young, en-
tered her web and chose one of the two options presented to them, both of
which amply satisfied her.


Interpretation
The life of the courtesan entailed the possibility of a power that was denied
a married woman, but it also had obvious    perils. The man who paid for the
courtesaxfs services in essence owned her, determining when he could pos-
sess her andwhen, later on, he would abandon her. As she grew older, her
options narrowed, as fewer men chose her. To avoid a life of poverty she
had to amass her fortune while she was young. The courtesan’s legendary
greed, then, reflected a practical necessity, yet also lessened her allure,
since the illusion of being desired is important to men, who are often alien-

                                   KEYS TO POWER
                                   Words like “freedom,” “options,” and “choice” evoke a power of possibility
                                   far beyond the reality of the benefits they entail. When examined closely,
                                   the choices we have——in the marketplace, in elections, in our jobs»-tend to
                                   have noticeable limitations: They are often a matter of a choice simply be-
                                   tween A and B, with the rest of the      alphabet out of the picture. Yet as long
                                   as   the faintest mirage of choice flickers on, we rarely focus on the missing
                                   options. We “choose” to believe that the game is fair, and that we have our
                                   freedom. We prefer not to think too much about the depth of our liberty to
                                   choose.
                                       This unwillingness to probe the smallness of our choices stems from
                                   the fact that too much freedom creates a kind of amdety. The phrase “un-
                                   limited options” sounds infinitely promising, but unlimited options would
                                   actually paralyze us and cloud our ability to choose. Our limited range of
                                   choices comforts us.

258        LAW 31
    This supplies the clever and cunning with enormous opportunities for

deception. For people who are choosing between alternatives find it hard
to believe they are being manipulated or deceived;
                                                       they cannot see that
you are
         allowing them a small amount of free will in
                                                      exchange for a much
more                       of
      powerful imposition your     own  will. Setting up a narrow range of
choices, then, should always be a part of your deceptions. There is a say-
ing: If you can get the bird to walk into the cage on its own, it will sing that
much more prettily.
    The following are among the most common forms of “controlling the
options”:

Color the Choices. This was a favored technique of Henry Kissinger. As
President Richard Nixon’s secretary of state, Kissinger considered himself
better informed than his boss, and believed that in most situations he could
make the best decision on his own. But if he tried to determine policy, he
would offend or perhaps enrage a notoriously insecure man. So Kissinger
would propose three or four choices of action for each situation, and would
present them in such a way that the one he preferred always seemed the
best solution compared to the others. Time afler time, Nixon fell for the
bait, never suspecting that he was moving where Kissinger pushed him.
This is an excellent device to use on the insecure master.


Force the Resistor. One of the main problems faced by Dr. Milton H. Er-
ickson, a pioneer of hypnosis therapy in the 1950s, was the relapse. His pa»
tients might seem to be recovering rapidly, but their apparent susceptibility
to the   therapy masked a deep resistance: They would soon relapse into old
habits, blame the doctor, and stop coming to see him. To avoid this, Ericlo
son began ordering some patients to have a relapse, to make themselves feel

as bad as when
                 they first came in—-——to go back to square one. Faced with
this option, the patients would usually “choose” to avoid the relapse-
which, of course, was what Erickson really wanted.
    This is a good technique to use on children and other willful people
who enjoy doing the opposite of what you ask them to: Push them to
“choose” what you want them to do by appearing to advocate the opposite.


Alter the Playing Field. In the 1860s,john D. Rockefeller set out to cre-
ate an oil monopoly. If he tried to buy up the smaller oil companies they
would figure out what he was doing and fight back. Instead, he began se-
cretly buying up the railway companies that transported the oil. When he
then attempted to take over a particular company, and met with resistance,
he reminded them of their dependence on the rails. Refusing them ship-

ping, or simply raising their fees, could ruin their business. Rockefeller a.l~
tered the playing field so that the only options the small oil producers had
were the ones he gave them.

    In this tactic your opponents know their hand is being forced, but it
doesn’t matter. The technique is effective against those who resist at all
costs.

                                                                                   LAW 31   259
                The    Shrinking Options. The latemineteenth-century art dealer Am-
                broise Vollard perfected this technique.
                      Customers would come to Volla.rd’s shop to see some Cézannes. He
                would show three paintings, neglect to mention a price, and pretend to
                doze off. The visitors would have to leave without deciding. They would
                usually come back the next day to see the paintings again, but this time
                Vollard would pull out less interesting works, pretending he thought they
                were   the same ones. The baffled customers would look at the new offer-
                ings, leave to think them over, and return yet again. Once again the same
                thing would happen: Vollard would show paintings of lesser quality still. Fi-
                nally the buyers would realize they had better grab what he was showing
                them, because tomorrow they would have to settle for something worse,
                perhaps at even higher prices.
                     A variation on this technique is to raise the price every time the buyer
                hesitates and another day goes by. This is an excellent negotiating ploy to
                use on the
                            chronically indecisive, who will fall for the idea that they are get-
                     a better deal
                ting               today than if they wait till tomorrow.

                The Weak Man on the Precipice. The weak are the easiest to maneuver
                by controlling their options. Cardinal do Retz, the great seventeenth~cen-
                tury provocateur, served as an unofficial assistant to the Duke of Orléans,
                who was notoriously indecisive. It was a constant struggle to convince the
                duke to take action»-—-he would hem and haw, weigh the options, and wait
                till the last moment, giving everyone around him an ulcer. But Retz discov~
                ered a way to handle him: He would describe all sorts of dangers, exaggep
                ating them as much as possible, until the duke saw a yawning abyss in
                every direction except one: the one Retz was pushing him to take.
                     This tactic is similar to “Color the Choices,” but with the weak you
                have to be more aggressive. Work on their emotions—use fear and terror
                to propel them into action. Tn: reason and they will always find a way to
                procrastinate.

                Brothers in Crime. This is a classic convartist technique: You attract your
                victims to some criminal scheme, creating a bond of blood and guilt be-
                tween you. They participate in your deception, commit a crime (or think

                they do-—-see the story of Sam Geezil in Law 3), and are easily manipu-
                lated. Serge Stavisky, the great French con artist of the 1920s, so entangled
                the government in his scams and swindles that the state did not dare to
                prosecute him, and “chose” to leave him alone. It is often wise to implicate
                in your deceptions the very person who can do you the most harm if you
                fail. Their involvement can be subtle—-even a hint of their involvement
                will narrow their options and buy their silence.


                The Horns of a Dilemma. This idea was demonstrated by General
                William Sherma.n’s infamous march through Georgia during the American
                Civil War. Although the Confederates knew what direction Sherman was


2&0   LAW’ 31
heading in, they never knew if he would attack from the left or the right, for
he divided his army into two wings--and if the rebels retreated from one
wing they found themselves facing the other. This is a classic trial lawyer’s
technique: The lawyer leads the witnesses to decide between two possible
explanations of an event, both of which poke a hole in their story. They
have to answer the lawyer’s questions, but whatever they say they hurt
themselves. The key to this move is to strike quickly: Deny the victim the
time to think of an escape. As they wriggle between the horns of the

dilemma, they dig their own grave.

Understand: In your struggles with your rivals, it will often be necessary
for you to hurt them. And if you are clearly the agent of their punishment,

expect a counterat1ack——expect revenge. If, however, they seem to them-
selaes to be the agents of their own misfortune, they will submit quietly.
When Ivan left Moscow for his rural village, the citizens asking him to re-
turn agreed to his demand for absolute power. Over the years to come,
they resented him less for the terror he unleashed on the country, because,
alter all, they had granted him his power themselves. This is why it is al
ways good to allow your victims their choice of poison, and to cloak your
involvement in providing it to them as far as possible.

Authority: For the wounds and every other evil that men inllict upon them-
selves spontaneously, and of their own choice, are in the long run less
painful than those inflicted by others. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 140'9—~1527)

                                                                                 LAW 3]   261
                REVERSAI.
                Controlling the options has one main purpose: to disguise yourself as the
                agent of power and punishment. The tactic works best, then, for those
                whose power is fragile, and who cannot operate too openly without incur-
                ring suspicion, resentment, and anger. Even as a general rule, however, it is
                rarely wise to be seen as exerting power directly and forcefully, no matter
                how secure or strong you are. It is usually more elegant and more effective
                to give   people the illusion of choice.
                    On the other hand, by limiting other people’s options you sometimes
                limit your own. There are situations in which it is to your advantage to
                allow your rivals a large degree of freedom: As you watch them operate,
                you give yourself rich opportunities to spy, gather information, and plan
                your deceptions. The nineteenth~century banker James Rothschild liked
                this method: He felt that if he tried to control his opponents’ movements,
                he lost the chance to observe their strategy and plan a more effective
                course.   The more freedom he allowed them in the short term, the more

                forcefully he could act against them in the long run.

                                   one noticed his
                                                     simple deceptions.
                                       Such is the power of the fantasies that take root in us, especially in
                                   times of scarcity and decline.     People rarely believe that their problems
                                   arise from their own misdeeds and stupidity. Someone or something out
                                   there is to blame—-the other, the world, the gods—and so salvation comes
                                   from the outside as well. Had Bragadino arrived in Venice armed with a
                                   detailed analysis of the reasons behind the city’s economic decline, and of
                                   the hardcnosed steps that it could take to turn things around, he would
                                   have been scorned. The reality was too ugly and the solution too painful-—
                                   mostly the kind of hard work that the citizens‘ ancestors had mustered to
                                   create an empire. Fantasy, on the other hand——in this case the romance of

                                   alchemy--was easy to understand and infinitely more palatable.
                                       To gain power, you must be a source of pleasure for those around
                                   you--and pleasure comes from playing to people’s fantasies. Never
                                   promise a gradual improvement through hard work; rather, promise the
                                   moon, the great and sudden transformation, the pot of gold.

                                   KEYS TO POWER
                                   Fantasy can never operate alone. It requires the backdrop of the huxndrum
                                   and the mundane. It is the oppressiveness of reality that allows fantasy to
                                   take root and bloom. In sixteenth-century Venice, the reality was one of de
                                   clirre and loss of prestige. The corresponding fantasy described a sudden
                                   recovery of past glories through the miracle of alchemy. While the reality
                                   only got worse, the Venetians inhabited a happy dream world in which
                                   their city restored its fabulous wealth and power overnight, turning dust
                                   into gold.
                                       The person who can spin a fantasy out of an oppressive reality has ac-
                                   cess to untold
                                                    power. As you search for the fantasy that will take hold of the


266         LAW 32
masses, then, keep your eye on the banal truths that weigh heavily on us
all. Never be distracted by peop1e’s glamorous portraits of themselves and
their lives; search and dig for what really imprisons them. Once you find
that, you have the magical key that will put great power in your hands.
    Although times and people change, let us examine a few of the oppres~
sive realities that endure, and the opportunities for power they provide:


The Reality: Change isslow and gradual. It requires ham’ work, a bit ofluck, a fair
amount   rel
       of —sacrg'fice, and a lot pfpatience.
The Fantasy: A sudden tmmfarmation will bring a total change in aneivfiirtunes,

bypassing work, luck, self-sacrifice, and time in one fantastic make.

     This is of course the fantasy par excellence of the charlatans who
prowl among us to this day, and was the key to B1'agadin0’s success.
Promise a great and total change-—~from poor to rich, sickness to health,

misery to ecstasy—and you will have followers.
     How did the great sixteenth-century German quack Leonhard
Thumeisser become the court physician for the Elector of Brandenburg
without ever studying medicine? Instead of offering amputations, leeches,
and foul~tasting purgatives (the medicaments of the time), Thurneisser ofv
fared sweevtasting elixirs and promised instant recovery. Fashionable
courtiers especially wanted his solution of “drinkable gold,” which cost a
fortune. If some inexplicable illness assailed you, Thur-neisser would con-
sult a horoscope and prescribe a talisman. Who could resist such a

fantasy-—-health and well-being without sacrifice and pain!

The Reality: The social realm has lzard~set codes and boundaries. We understand
time limits and know that we have to move within the same familiar circles, ziay in
and ritzy out.

     In the early 1700s, all London was abuzz with talk of a mysterious

stranger, a young man named George Psalmanazar. He had arrived from
what was to most Englishmen a fantastical land: the island of Formosa
(now Taiwan),        off the   coast   of China.   Oxford     University engaged
Psalmauazar to teach the island’s language; a few years later he translated
the Bible into Formosan, then wrote a bool<—ar: immediate bestseller--on
Formosa’s history and geography. English royalty wined and dined the

young man, and everywhere he went he entertained his hosts with won-
drous stories of his homeland, and its bizarre customs.
    After Psalmanazar died, however, his will revealed that he was in fact
merely a Frenchman with a rich imagination. Everything he had said about
Formosa——-its alphabet, its language, its literature, its entire culture-—he had
invented. He had built on the English puhlic’s ignorance of the place to
concoct an       elaborate story that fulfilled their desire for the exotic and


                                                                                        LAW 32   ‘.767
               strange. British cultu.re’s rigid control of people’s dangerous dreams gave I




               him the perfect opportunity to exploit their fantasy.
                     The fantasy of the exotic, of course, can also skirt the sexual. It must
               not come too close, though, for tl1e physical hinders the power of fantasy; it
               can   be seen, grasped, and then tired of-—the fate of most courtesans. The

               bodily charms of the mistress only whet the master’s appetite for more and
               different pleasures, a new beauty to adore. To bring power, fantasy must re»
               main to some degree unrealized, literally unreal. The dancer Mata Hari,
               for instance, who rose to public prominence in Paris before World War I,
               had quite ordinary looks. Her power came from the fantasy she created of
               being strange ‘and exotic, unknowable and indecipherable. The taboo she
               worked with was less sex itself than the breaking of social codes.
                    Another form of the fantasy of the exotic is simply the hope for relief
               from boredom. Con artists love to play on the oppressiveness of the work-
               ing world, its lack of adventure. Their cons might involve, say, the recov-
               ery of lost Spanish treasure, with the possible participation of an alluring
               Mexican sefiorita. and a connection to the president of a South American

               country—a.nything oficering release from the humdrum.

               The Reality:   Society is fragmented and full ofconflict.
               The Fantasy: People can come together in a mystical union ofsouls.


                     In the 19205 the con man Oscar Hartzell made a quick fortune out of
               the agevold Sir Francis Drake swindle—basically promising any sucker who
               happened to be surnamed “Drake” a substantial share of the long-lost
               “Drake treasure,” to which Hartzell had access. Thousands across the Mid-
               west fell for the scam, which Hartzell   cleverly turned into a crusade against
               the government and everyone else who was trying to keep the Drake for»
               tune out of the rightful hands of its heirs. There developed a mystical union
               of the oppressed Drakes, with emotional rallies and meetings. Promise such
               a union and
                            you can gain much power, but it is a dangerous power that can
               easily turn against you. This is a fantasy for demagogues to play on.

               The Reality: Death. The dead cannot be brought back, tlzepart cannot be changed.

                     This con has many variations, but requires great skill and subtlety.
                     The beauty and importance of the art of Vermeer have long been rec
               ognized, but his paintings are small in number, and are extremely rare. In
               the 1930s, though, Vermeers began to appear on the art market. Experts
               were called on to
                                  verify them, and pronounced them real. Possession of
               these new Vermeers would crown a collector’s career. It was like the resur-
               rection of Lazarus: In a strange way, Vermeer had been brought back to
               life. The past had been changed.
                   Only later did it come out that the new Vermeers were the work of a
               middle-aged Dutch forget named Han van Meegeren. And he had chosen

268   LAW 32
Vermeer for his scam because he understood fantasy: The paintings would
seem real
            precisely because the public, and the experts as well, so desper-
ately wanted to believe they were.
   Remember: The key to fantasy is distance. The distant has allure and
promise, seems simple and problem free. What you are offering, xhen,
should be ungraspable. Never let it become oppressively familiar; it is the
mirage in the distance, withdrawing as the sucker approaches. Never be
(no direct in describing the fantasywkeep it vague. As a forget of fantasies,
let your victim come close enough to see and be tempted, but keep him far

away enough that he stays dreaming and desiring.

   I found it far more interesting and profitable to romance than to

                                                                                LAW 32   269
               REVERSAL
               If there is power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses, there is also

               danger, Fantasy usually contains an element of play-the public half real-
               izes it is being duped, but it keeps the dream alive anyway, relishing the en»
               tertainment and the temporary diversion from the everyday that you are

               providing. So keep it 1ight~—never come too close to the place where you
               are
                   actually expected to produce results. That place may prove extremely
               hazardous.
                   After    Bragadino established himself in Munich, he found that the
               sober-minded Bavarians had far less faith in alchemy than the tempera-
               mental Venelians. Only the duke really believed in it, for he needed it des—
               perately to rescue him from the hopeless mess he was in. As Bragadino
               played his familiar waiting game, accepting gifts and expecting patience,
               the public grew angry. Money was being spent and was yielding no results.
               In 1592 the Bavarians demanded justice, and eventually Bragadino found
               himself swinging from the gallows. As before, he had promised and had
               not delivered, but this time he had misjudged the forbearance of his hosts,

               and his inability to fulfill their fantasy proved fatal.
                    One last thing: Never make the mistake of imagining that fantasy is al»

               ways fantastical. It certainly contrasts with reality, but reality itself is some
               times so theatrical and stylized that fantasy becomes a desire for simple

               things. The image Abraham Lincoln created of himself, for example, as a
               homespun country lawyer with a beard, made him the common man’s
               president.
                   P. T. Barnum created a successful act with Tom Thumb, a dwarf who
               dressed up as famous leaders of the past, such as Napoleon, and iam-
               pooned them wickedly. The show delighted everyone, right up to Queen
               Victoria, by appealing to the fantasy of the time: Enough of the vain-
               glorious rulers of history, the common man knows best Tom Thumb re-
               versed the familiar pattern of fantasy in which the strange and unknown
               becomes the ideal. But the act still obeyed the Law, for underlying it
               was the
                        fantasy that the simple man is without problems, and is happier
               than the powerful and the rich.
                    Both Lincoln and Tom Thumb played the commoner but carefully
               maintained their distance. Should you play with such a fantasy, you too
               must carefully cultivate distance and not allow your “common” persona to
               become too familiar or it will not project as fantasy.

fought over her and their friendship quickly ended, along with any danger
of a conspiracy.

fold, like Louis XVI of France, if he kept Bismarck on as prime minister.
     Bismarck knew he had to get to the king before it was too late. He also
knew he had blundered, and should have tempered his fiery words. Yet as
he contemplated his strategy, he decided not to apologize but to do the
exact opposite, Bismarck knew the king well.

                                                                                                LAW 33          279
                    When the two men met, William, predictably, had been worked into a
               tizzy by the queen. He reiterated his fear of being guillotined. But Bismarck
               only replied, “Yes, then we shall be dead! We must die sooner or later, and
               could there be a more respectable way of dying? I should die lighting for
               the cause of my king and master. Your Majesty would die sealing with your
               own  blood your royal rights granted by God’s graze. Whether upon the
               scafiold or upon the battlefield makes no difference to the glorious staking
               of body and life on behalf of rights granted by God’s grace!“ On he went,

               appealing to William’s sense of honor and the majesty of his position as
               head of the army. How could the king allow people to push him around?
               Wasn’t the honor of Germany more important than quibbling over words?
               Not only did the prime minister convince the king to stand up to both his
               wife and his parliament, he persuaded him to build up the am1y—Bis-
               matclwfs goal all along.

               Interpretation
               Bismarck knew the king felt bullied by those around him. He knew that
               William had a military background and a deep sense of honor, and that he
               felt ashamed at his cravenness before his wife and his government. Wdliam

               secretly yearned to be a great and mighty king, but he dared not express
               this ambition because he was afraid of ending up like Louis XVI. Where a
               show of courage often conceals a man’s timidity, William’s timidity con-
               cealed his need to show courage and thump his chest.
                    Bismarck sensed the longing for glory beneath William’s pacifist front,
               so he
                      played to the king’s insecurity about his manhood, finally pushing
               him into three wars and the creation of a German empire. Timidity is a. po-
               tent weakness to exploit. Timid souls often yearn to be their opposite——to

               be Napoleons. Yet they lack the inner strength. You, in essence, can be-
               come their
                            Napoleon, pushing them into bold actions that serve your
               needs while also making them dependent on you. Remember: Look to the
               opposites and never take appearances at face value.

 Authority: Finzi out each man’s thumbscrew. "l‘is the art of setting their
 wills in action. It needs more skill than resolution. You must know
 where to get at anyone. Every volition has a special motive which varies
 according to taste. All men are idolaters, some of fame, others of self-

REVERSAL

Playing on people’s weakness has one significant danger: You may stir up
an action you cannot control.

     In your games of power you always look several steps ahead and plan

accordingly. And you exploit the fact that other people are more emotional
and incapable of such foresight. But when you play on their vulnerabilities,
the areas over which they have least control, you can unleash emotions
that will upset your plans. Push timid people into bold action and they may
go too far; answer their need for attention or recognition and they may
need more than you want to give them. The helpless, childish element you
are playing on can turn against you.

     The more emotional the weakness, the greater the potential danger.
Know the limits to this game, then, and never get carried away by your
control over your victims. You are after power, not the thrill of control.

loved money and had amassed a huge fortune.
     As the reign of the “bourgeois king” plodded on, people came to de
spire him. The aristocracy could not endure the sight of an unkingly king,
and within a few years they turned on him. Meanwhile the growing class of
the poor, including the radicals who had chased out Charles X, found no
satisfaction in a ruler who neither acted as a king nor governed as a man of
the people. The bankers to whom Louis-Philippe was the most beholden
soon realized that it was
                          they who controlled the country, not he, and they
treated him with growing contempt. One day, at the start of a train trip or-
ganized for the royal family, James Rothschild actually berated him-and
iri public-—for being late. Once the king had made news by treating the
banker as an equal; now the banker treated the king as an inferior.
     Eventually the workers’ insurrections that had brought down Louis-
Phi1ippe’s predecessor began to ree.-merge, and the king put them down
with force. But what was he defending so brutally? Not the institution of the
monarchy, which he disdained, nor a democratic republic, which his rule
prevented. What he was really defending, it seemed, was his own fortune,
and the fortunes of the bankers—-not a way to inspire loyalty among the

citizenry.
    In early 1848, Frenchmen of all classes began to demonstrate for elec-
toral reforms that would make the country truly democratic. By February
the demonstrations had turned violent. To assuage the populace, Louis-
Philippe fired his prime minister and appointed a liberal as a replacement.
But this created the opposite of the desired effect: The people sensed they
could push the king around. The demonstrations turned into a l'ull~fledged
revolution, with gunfire and barricades in the streets.


                                                                                              LAW 34        293
                   On the night of February 23, a crowd of Parisians surrounded the

               palace. With a suddenness that caught everyone by surprise, Louis-
               Philippe abdicated that very evening and fled to England. He left no sue»
               cessor, nor even the suggestion of one-—his whole government folded up
               and dissolved like a traveling circus leaving town.


               Interpretation
               Louis-Philippe consciously dissolved the aura that natu.rally pertains to
               kings and leaders. Scoffing at the symbolism of grandeur, he believed a
               new world was
                                 dawning, where rulers should act and be like ordinary citi
               zens. He was right: A new world, without
                                                            kings and queens, was certainly
               on its
                       way. He  was
                                     profoundly  wrong,  however,   in predicting a change in
               the dynamics of power.
                    The bourgeois king’s hat and umbrella amused the French at first, but
               soon
                      grew irritating. People knew that Louis-Philippe was not really like
               them at all—that the hat and umbrella were essentially a kind of trick to en-
               courage them in the fantasy that the country had suddenly grown more
               equal. Actually, though, the divisions of wealth had never been greater.
               The French expected their ruler to be a bit of a showman, to have some
               presence. Even a radical like Robespierre, who had briefly come to power
               during the French Revolution fifty years earlier, had understood this, and
               cenainly Napoleon, who had turned the revolutionary republic into an im
               per-ial regime, had known it in his bones. Indeed as soon as Louis—Phi1ippe
               fled the stage, the French revealed their true desire: They elected
               Napoleon’s grand-nephew president. He was a virtual unknown, but they
               hoped he would recreate the great general’s powerful aura, erasing the
               awkward memory of the “bourgeois king.”
                    Powerful people may be tempted to affect a common-man aura, trying
               to create the illusion that they and their subjects or underlings are basically
               the same. But the people whom this false gesture is intended to impress will
               quickly see through it. They understand that they are not being given more
               power——that it only appears as if they shared in the powerful person’s fate.
               The only kind of common touch that works is the kind ailected by Franklin
               Roosevelt, a style that said the president shared values and goals with the
               common
                            people even while he remained a patrician at heart. He never
               pretended to erase his distance from the crowd.
                    Leaders who try to dissolve that distance through a false chumrniness

               gradually lose the ability to inspire loyalty, fear, or love. Instead they elicit
               contempt. Like Louis—Philippe, they are too uninspiring even to be worth
               the guillotine-——the best they can do is simply vanish in the night, as if they
               were never there.



               OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
               When Christopher Columbus was trying to find funding for his legendary
               voyages, many around him believed he came from the Italian aristocracy.
               This view was passed into history through a biography written after the ex-

    to feel so confident. People who wear crowns seem to feel no inner sense of
    the limits to what they can ask for or what they can accomplish. This too
    radiates outward. Limits and boundaries disappear. Use the Strategy of the
    Crown and you will be surprised how often it bears fruit. Take as an exa.m~

    ple those happy children who ask for whatever they want, and get it. Their
    high expectations are their charm. Adults enjoy granting their wishes-——just
    as Isabella
                 enjoyed granting the wishes of Columbus.
          Throughout history, people of undistinguished birth-—-the Theodora: of
‘   Byzantium, the Columbuses, the Beethovens, the Disraelis-——-have managed
    to work the
                  Strategy of the Crown, believing so firmly in their own greatness
    that it becomes a seIf~fulfil1ing prophecy. The trick is simple: Be overcome

    by your selfibelief. Even while you know you are practicing a kind of de-
    ception on yourself, act like a king. You are likely to be treated as one.
          The crown may separate you from other people, but it is up to you to
    make that separation real: You have to act differently, demonstrating your
    distance from those around you. One way to emphasize your difference is
    to always act with dignity, no matter the circumstance. Louis~Philippe gave
    no sense of being different from other
                                                  people—he was the banker king.
    And the moment his subjects threatened him, he caved in. Everyone
    sensed this and pounced. Lacking regal dignity and firmness of purpose,
    Louis-Philippe seemed an impostor, and the crown was easily toppled
    from his head.

       Regal bearing should not be confused with arrogance. Arrogance may
    seem the king’s entitlement, but in fact it betrays insecurity. It is the very
    opposite of a royal demeanor.
                                                                                                      LAW :54
                    Haile Selassie, ruler of Ethiopia for forty or so years beginning in 1930,
               was once a young man named       Lij Tafari. He came from a noble family, but
               there was no real chance of him coming to power, for he was far down the
               line of succession from the king then on the throne, Menelik II. Neverthe-
               less, from an early age he exhibited a self~coufidence and a royal bearing
               that surprised everyone around him.
                    At the age of fourteen, Tafari went to live at the court, where he imme—
               diately impressed Menelik and became his favorite. Tafarfs grace under
               fire, his patience, and his calm selflassurance fascinated the king. The other
               young nobles, arrogant, blustery, and envious, would push this slight,
               bookish teenager around. But he never got angry-—-that would have been a
               sign of insecurity, to which he would not stoop. There were already people
                around him who felt he would someday rise to the top, for he acted as if he
               were already there.

                     Years later, in 1936, when the Italian Fascists had taken over Ethiopia
               and Tafari, now called Haile Selassie, was in exile, he addressed the League
               of Nations to plead his country’s case. The Italians in the audience heckled
               him with vulgar abuse, but he maintained his dignified pose, as if com-

               pletely unaffected. This elevated him while making his opponents look
               even
                      uglier. Dignity, in fact, is invariably the mask to assume under difficult
               circumstances: It is as if nothing can affect you, and you have all the time
               in the world to respond. This is an extremely powerful pose.
                     A royal demeanor has other uses. Con artists have long known the
               value of an aristocratic front; it either disazms people and makes them less
               suspicious, or else it intimidates them and puts them on the defensive———and
               as Count Victor
                                 Lustig knew, once you put a sucker on the defensive he is
               doomed. The con man Yellow Kid Well, too, would often assume the trap

               pings of a man of wealth, along with the nonchalance that goes with them.
               Alluding to some magical method of making money, he would stand aloof,
               like a king, exuding confidence as if he really were fabulously rich. The
               suckers would beg to be in on the con, to have a chance at the wealth that
               he so clearly displayed.
                    Finally, to reinforce the inner psychological tricks involved in project-
               ing royal demeanor, there are outward strategies to help you create the
                   a

               effect. First, the Columbus Strategy: Always make a bold demand. Set your
               price high and do not waver. Second, in a dignified way, go after the high-
               est person in the building. This immediately puts you on the same plane as
               the chief executive you are attacking. It is the David and Goliath Strategy:
               By choosing a great opponent, you create the appearance of greatness.
                    Third, give a gift of some sort to those above you. This is the strategy
               of those who have a patron: By giving your patron a gift, you are essentially

               saying that the two of you are equal. It is the old con game of giving so that
               you can take. When the Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino wanted the
               Duke of Mantua as his nerd patron, he knew that if he was slavish and
               sycophantic, the duke would think him unworthy; so he approached the
               duke with gifts, in this case paintings by the wn‘ter’s good friend Titian.


288   LAW 34
Accepting the gifts created a kind of equality between duke and writer: The
duke was put at ease by the feeling that he was dealing with a man of his
own aristocratic stamp. He funded Aretino
                                              generously. The gift strategy is
subtle and brilliant because you do not beg: You ask for help in a dignified
way that implies equality between two people, one of whom just happens
to have more money.

      Remember: It is up to you to set your own price. As}: for less and that
is just what you will get Ask for more, however, and you send a signal that

you are worth a king’s ransom. Even those who turn you down respect you
for your confidence, and that respect will eventually pay off in ways you
cannot imagine.




             Image: The Crown. Place it upon your head
              and you assume a different pose——tranqui1
              yet radiating assurance. Never show
               doubt, never lose your dignity beneath
                the crown, or it will not fit. It will seem
                  to be destined for one more   worthy. Do
                  not wait for a coronation; the great»
                   est   emperors   crown   themselves.

               The idea behind the assumption of regal confidence is to set yourself apart
               from other people, but if you take this too far it will be your undoing.
               Never make the mistake of thinking that you elevate yourself by humiliat-

               ing people. Also, it is never a good idea to loom too high above the
               crowcl—you make an easy target. And there are times when an aristocratic
               pose is eminently dangerous.
                    Charles I, king of England during the 16405, faced a profound public
               disenchantment with the institution of monarchy. Revolts erupted through»
               out the country, led by Oliver Cromwell. Had Charles reacted to the times

               with insight, supporting reforms and making a show of sacrificing some of
               his power, history might have been different. Instead he reverted to an
               even more regal pose, seeming outraged by the assault on his
                                                                                   power and

               Understand: You are radiating confidence, not arrogance or disdain.
                    Finally, it is true that you can sometimes find some power through af-
               fecting a kind of earthy vulgarity, which will prove amusing by its extreme-
               ness. But to the extent that
                                              you win this game by going beyond the limits,
               separating yourself from other people by appearing even more vulgar than
               they are, the game is dangerous: There will always be people more vulgar
               than you, and you will easily be replaced the following season by someone

               younger and worse.

                                   pleasure in the moment, but the better to play the game of power. First,
                                   when your mind is uncluttered by constant emergencies you will see fur»
                                   ther into the future. Second, you will be able to resist the baits that people
dangle in front of you, and will keep yourself from becoming another im~
patient sucker. Third, you will have more room to be flexible. Opportuni-
ties will inevitably arise that you had not expected and would have missed
had you forced the pace. Fourth, you will not move from one deal to the
next without   completing the first one. To build your power’s foundation
can take years; make sure that foundation is secure. Do not be a flash in the

pan—-«success that is built up slowly and surely is the only kind that lasts.
    Finally, slowing time down will give you a perspective on the times
you live in, letting you take a certain distance and putting you in a less
emotionally charged position to see the shapes of things to come. Hurriers
will often mistake surface phenomena for a real trend, seeing only what
they want to see. How much better to see what is really happening, even if
it is unpleasant or makes your task harder.


Forced Time. The trick in forcing time is to upset the timing of others-——t0
make them hurry, to make them wait, to make them abandon their own
pace, to distort their perception of time. By upsetting the timing of your op~
ponent while you stay patient, you open up time for yourself, which is half
the game.
      In 1473 the great Turkish sultan Mehmed the Conqueror invited nego-
tiations with Hungary to end the elf-andam war the two countries had

waged for years. When the Hungarian emissary arrived in Turkey to start
the talks, Turkish officials humbly apologized——Mehmed had just left Istan-
bul, the capital, to battle his longtime foe, Uzun Hasan. But he urgently
wanted peace with Hungary, and had asked that the emissary join him at
the front.
    When the emissary anived at the site of the fighting, Mehmed had al-
ready left it, moving eastward in pursuit of his swift foe. This happened
several times. Wherever the emissary stopped, the Thrks lavished gifts and
banquets on him, in pleasurable but timeconsuming ceremonies. Finally
Mehrned defeated Uzun and met with the emissary. Yet his terms for peace
with Hungary were excessively harsh. After a few days, the negotiations
ended, and the usual stalemate remained in place. But this was fine with
Mehmecl. In fact he had planned it that way all along: Plotting his cam-
paign against Uzun, he had seen that diverting his armies to the east would
leave his western flank vulnerable. To prevent Hungary from taking advan»
tage of his weakness and his preoccupation elsewhere, he flrst dangled the
lure of peace before his enemy, then made them wait»-all on his own
terms.

    Making people wait is a powerful way of forcing time, as long as they
do not figure out what you are up to. You control the clock, they linger in
limbowand rapidly come unglued, opening up opportunities for you to
strike. The opposite effect is equally powerful: You make your opponents
hurry. Start off your dealings with them slowly, then suddenly apply pres-
sure,   making them feel that everything is happening at once. People who
lack the time to think will make mistakes-—so set their deadlines for them.
                This was the technique Machiavelli admired in Cesare Borgia, who, during
                negotiations, would suddenly press vehemently for a decision, upsetting
                his opponent’s timing and patience. For who would dare make Cesare
                wait?
                     Joseph Duveen, the famous art dealer, knew that if he gave an indeci-
                sive buyer like John D. Rockefeller a deadline»-the painting had to leave
                the country, another tycoon was interested in it—the client would buy just
                in time. Freud noticed that patients who had spent years in psychoanalysis
                without improvement would miraculously recover just in time if he fixed a
                definite date for the end of the therapy. Jacques Lacan, the famous French
                psychoanalyst, used a variation on this tactic—he would sometimes end
                the customary hour session of therapy after only ten minutes, without
                warning. After this happened several times, the patient would realize that
                he had better make maximum use of the time, rather than wasting much of
                the hour with a lot of talk that meant nothing. The deadline, then, is a pow-
                erful tool. Close off the vistas of indecision and force people to make up
                their damn minds or get to the point—never let them make you play on
                their excruciating terms. Never give them time.

                    Magicians and showmen are experts in forcing time. Houdini could
                often wriggle free of handcuffs in minutes, but he would draw the escape
                out to an hour, making the audience sweat, as time came to an apparent
                standstill. Magicians have always known that the best way to alter our pet-
                ception of time is often to slow down the pace. Creating suspense brings
                time to a terrifying pause: The slower the magician’s hands move, the eas-
                ier it is to create the illusion of speed, making people think the rabbit has

                appeared instantaneously. The great nineteenthcentury magician _]ean—Eu—
                gene Robert~Houdin took explicit notice of this effect: “The more slowly a
                story is told,” he said, “the shorter it seems.”
                    Going slower also makes wha). you are doing more interesting»-the
                audience yields to your pace, becomes entranced. It is a state in which time
                whizzes delightfully by. You must practice such illusions, which share in the
                hypnotisfs power to alter perceptions of time.

                End Time. You can play the game with the utmost artistry—--waiting pa-

                tiently for the right moment to act, putting your competitors off their form
                by messing with their timing~—-but it won’t mean a thing unless you know
                how to finish. Do not be one of those people who look like paragons of pa«
                tieuce but are actually just afraid to bring things to a close: Patience is
                worthless unless combined with a willingness to fall ruthlessly on your op-
                ponent at the right moment. You can wait as long as necessary for the con
                clusion to come, but when it comes it must come quickly. Use speed to

                paralyze your opponent, cover up any mistakes you might make, and im-
                press people with your aura of authority and finality.
                    With the patience of a snake charmer, you draw the snake out with
                calm and steady rhythms. Once the snake is out, though, would you dangle
                your foot above its deadly head? There is never a good reason to allow the

 slightest hitch in your endgame. Your mastery of timing can really only be
judged by how you work with end time——-how you quickly change the pace
 and bring things to a swift and definitive conclusion.

sisted that she had remained a virgin through her marriage to Arthur, and

Pope Clement VII supported her by giving his blessing to the union, which
he could not have done had he considered it incestuous. Yet after years of
marriage to Henry, Catherine had failed to produce a son, and in the early
1520s she had entered menopause. To the king this could only mean one
thing: She had lied about her virginity, their union was incesmous, and
God had punished them.
     There was another reason why Henry wanted to get rid of Catherine:
He had fallen in love with a younger woman, Anne Boleyn. Not only was
he in love with her, but if he married her he could still hope to sire a legiti-
mate son. The marriage to Catherine had to be annulled. For this, how-

ever,   Henry had to apply to the Vatican. But Pope Clement would never
annul the marriage,
    By the summer of 1527, rumors spread throughout Europe that Henry
was  about to attempt the impossible-—to annul his marriage against
Clement’s wishes. Catherine would never abdicate, let alone voluntarily
enter a
        nunnery, as Henry had urged her. But Henry had his own strategy:
He stopped sleeping in the same bed with Catherine, since he considered
her his sister~in-law, not his lawful wife. He insisted on calling her Princess

Franklin D. Roosevelt complained bitterly about the money his adminis-

with the public, who saw the president as working to end the Great De~

how wasteful he had become: his dog, Fala, which he lavished with favors
and attention. Critics railed at his insensifivitywspendmg taxpayers‘

                                             The Japanese emperor Go-Saiin, a great disciple of the tea ceremony,

owned a priceless antique tea howl that all the coui-tiers envied. One day a

guest, Dainagon Tsunehiro. asked if he could carry the tea bowl into the
light, to examine it more closely. The bowl rarely left the table, but the em-
peror was in good spirits and he consented. As Dainagori carried the bowl
to the railing of the verandah, however, and held it up to the light, it

slipped from his hands and fell on a rock in the garden below, smashing
into tiny fragments.
     The emperor of course was furious. “It was indeed most clumsy of me
to let it drop in this
                       way,” said Dainagon, with a deep how, “but really
there is not much harm done. This ldo tea~bowl is a very old one and it is

impossible to say how much longer it would have lasted, but anyhow it is
not a thing of any public use, so I think it rather fortunate that it has broken
thus.” This surprising response had an immediate effect: The emperor
calmed down. Dainagon neither sniveled nor overapologized, but signaled
his own worth and power by treating his mistake with a touch of disdain.
The emperor had to respond with a similar aristocratic indifference; his
anger had made him seem low and petty——an image Dainagon was able to
manipulate.
     Among equals this tactic might bacldire: Your indifference could make
you seem callous. But with a master, if you act quickly and without great
fuss, it can work to great effect: You bypass his angry response, save him
the time and energy he would waste by brooding over it, and allow him the
opportunity to display his own lack of pettiness publicly.
     If we make excuses and denials when we are caught in a mistake or a
deception, we stir the waters and make the situation worse. It is ofien wiser
to play things the opposite way. The Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino
often boasted of his aristocratic lineage, which was, of course, a fiction,
since he was actually the son of a shoemaker. When an enemy of his finally
revealed the embarrassing truth, word quiddy spread, and soon all of
Venice (where he lived at the time) was aghast at Aretino’s lies. Had he
tried to defend himself, he would have only dragged himself down. His re-
sponse was masterful: He announced that he was indeed the son of a shoe-
maker, but this only proved his greatness, since he had risen from the
lowest stratum of society to its very pinnacle. From then on he never men-
tioned his previous lie, trumpeting instead his new position on the matter
of his ancestry.
    Remember: The powerful responses to niggling, petty annoyances and
irritations are contempt and disdain. Never show that something has af-
fected you, or that you are offended——that only shows you have acknowl-
edged a problem. Contempt is a dish that is best served cold and without
affectarion.

                   Authority: Know how to play the card of contempt. It is the most politic
                   kind of revenge. For there are many of whom we should have known

                   nothing if their distinguished opponents had taken no notice of them.
                   There is no revenge like oblivion, for it is the entombment of the unwor-
                   thy in the dust of their own nothingness. (Baltasar Gracién, 1601-1658)


                   REVERSAL
                   You must play the card of contempt with care and delicacy. Most small
                   troubles will vanish on their own if you leave them be; but some will grow
                   and fester unless you attend to them. Ignore a person of inferior stature and
                   the next time you look he has become a serious rival, and your contempt
                   has made him vengeful as well. The geat princes of Renaissance Italy
                   chose to ignore Cesare Borgia at the outset of his career as a young general
                   in the army of his father, Pope Alexander VI. By the time they paid a1ten~
                   tion it was too lat.e——the cub was now a lion, gobbling up chunks of Italy.

                   Often, then, while you show contempt publicly you will also need to keep
                   an
                      eye on the problem privately, monitoring its status and making sure it
                   goes away. Do not let it become a cancerous cell.
                       Develop the skill of sensing problems when they are still small and
                   taking care of them before they become intractable. Leam to distinguish
                   between the potentially disastrous and the mildly irritating, the nuisance
                   that will quietly go away on its own. In either case, though, never com—

our perverse     nature.) It also happens that words offend us, stirring up asso-
ciations unintended by the speaker.
    The visual, on the other hand, short-circuits the labyrinth of words. It
strikes with an emotional power and immediacy that leave no gaps for re-
flecfion and doubt. Like music, it leaps right over rational, reasonable
droughts. Imagine the Moon Doctor trying to make a case for his medical
practice, trying to convince the unconverted by telling them about the
healing powers of the moon, and about his own special connection to a dis-
tant object in the sky. Fortunately for him, he was able to create a com-

pelling spectacle that made words unnecessary. The moment his patients
entered the beer hall, the image of the moon spoke eloquently enough.
     Understand: Words put you on the defensive. If you have to explain
yourself your power is already in question. The image, on the other hand,
imposes itself as a given. It discourages questions, creates forceful associa-
tions, resists unintended interpretations, communicates instantly, and
forges bonds that transcend social dilferences. Words stir up arguments
and divisions; images bring people together. They are the quintessential in-
struments of power.

                                                                                                 LAW 3 7                313
                    Diana) or a verbal description of something visual (the words “the Sun
                    King”). The symbolic object stands for something else, something abstract
                    (such as the image “Diana” standing for chastity). The abstract concept-
                   purity, patriotism, courage, lovc~—~is full of emotional and powerful associa-
                   tions. The symbol is a shortcut of expression, containing dozens of

                   meanings in one simple phrase or object. The symbol of the Sun King, as
                   explained by Louis XIV, can be read on many layers, but the beauty of it is
                   that its associations required no explanation, spoke immediately to his sub-
                   jects, distinguished him from all other kings, and conjured up a kind of
                    majesty that went far beyond the words themselves. The symbol contains
                   untold power.
                         The first step in using symbols and images is to understand the pri-
                   macy of sight among the senses. Before the Renaissance, it has been an
                   gued, sight and the other senses--taste, touch, and so on-—-operated on a
                   relatively equal plane. Since then, however, the visual has come to domi-
                   nate the others, and is the sense we most
                                                               depend on and trust. As Gracién
                   said, “The truth is generally seen, rarely heard.” When the Renaissance
                   painter Fra Filippo Lippi was a captured slave among the Moors, he won
                   his freedom by sketching a drawing of his master on a white wall with a

                   piece of charcoal; when the owner saw the drawing, he instantly under-
                   stood the power of a man who could make such images, and let Fra Lippi

                   go. That one image was far more powerful than any argument the artist
                   could have made with words.
                        Never neglect the way you arrange things visually. Factors like color,
                   for example, have enormous symbolic resonance. When the con artist Yel-
                   low Kid Weil created a newsletter touting the phony stocks he was ped-
                   dling, he called it the “Red Letter Newsletter” and had it printed, at
                   considerable expense, in red ink. The color created a sense of urgency,
                   power, and good fortune. Weil recognized details like these as keys to de-
                   ception—as do modern advertisers and mass-marketers. If you use “gold”
                   in the title of anything you are trying to sell, for example, print it in gold.
               .
                   Since the eye predominates, people will respond more to the color than to
                   the word.
                         The wsual contains great emotional power. The Roman emperor Con-
                   stantine worshipped the sun as a god for most of his life; one day, though,
                   he looked up at the sun, and saw a cross superimposed on it. The vision of
                   the cross over the sun proved to him the ascendancy of the new religion,
                   and he converted not just himself but the whole Roman Empire to Chris-
                   tianity soon thereafter. All the preaching and proselytizing in the world
                   could not have been as powerful. Find and associate yourself with the im-
                   ages and symbols that will communicate in this immediate way today, and
                   you will have untold power.
                       Most effective of all is anew con1bination—a fusion of images and sym-
                   bols that have not been seen together before, but that through their associ-
                   ation clearly demonstrate your new idea, message, religion. The creation of
                   new images and symbols out of old ones in this way has a poetic effect-
                   viewers’ associations run rampant. giving them a sense of participation.

314   LAW 37
   Visual images often appear in a sequence, and the order in which they

appear creates a symbol. The first to appear, for instance, symbolizes
power; the image at the center seems to have central importance‘
    Near the end of World War II, orders came down from General Eisen-
hower thax American troops were to lead the way into Paris after its liber~
ation from the Nazis. The French general Charles de Gaulle, however,
realized that this sequence would imply that the Americans now com-
manded the fate of France. Through much manipulation, de Gaulle made
certain that he and the French Second Armored Division would appear at
the head of the liberating force. The strategy worked: After he had success
fully pulled off this stunt, the Allies started treating him as the new leader
of an independent France. De Gaulle knew that a leader has to locate him’
self literally at the head of his troops. This visual association is crucial to the
emotional response that he needs to elicit.
     Things change in the game of symbols: It is probably no longer possiv
ble to pose as a “sun king,” or to wrap the mantle of Diana around you. Yet

you can associate yourself with such symbols more indirectly. And, of
course, you can make your own mythology out of figures from more re-
cent history,people who are comfortably dead but still powerfully associaw
five in the public eye. The idea is to give yourself an aura, a stature that

your normal banal appearance simply will not create. By herself Diane de
Poitiers had no such radiant powers; she was as human and ordinary as
most of us. But the   symbol elevated her above the human lot, and made
her seem divine.
     Using symbols also has a courtierlike effect, since they are often gen-
tler than brutish words. The psychotherapist Dr. Milton H. Erickson al-
ways tried to find symbols and images that would communicate to the
patient in ways that words could not. When dealing with a severely trou~
bled patient, he would not question him directly but would talk about
something irrelevant, such as driving through the desert in Arizona, where
he practiced in the 19505. In describing this he would eventually come to
an appropriate
                 symbol for what he suspected was the man’s problem. If he
felt the palient was isolated, say, Dr. Erickson would talk of a single iron-
wood tree, and how its isolation left it battered by the winds. Making an
emotional connection with the tree as a symbol, the patient would open up
more readily to the doctor’: probing.

      Use the power of symbols as a way to rally, animate, and unite your

troops or team. During the rebellion against the French crown in 1648,
those loyal to the king disparaged the rebels by comparing them to the

slingshots (in French, fiandesl that little boys use to frighten big boys. Cardi~
nal de Retz decided to turn this disparaging term into the rebels’ symbol:
The uprising was now known as the Fronde, and the rebels as fivndeurs.
They began to wear sashes in their hats that symbolized the slingshot, and
the word became their rallying cry. Without it the rebellion might well
have petered out Always find a symbol to represent your cause—the more
emotional associations, the better.
    The best way to use images and symbols is to organize them into a

                                             Spartan authorities. These men wanted to find out more, so they had the
                                             messenger arrange to meet Pausanias in a temple where they could hide
                                             and listen behind a partition. l/Vhat Pausanias said shocked them»-they

Interpretation
At first glance it might seem that Pausanias simply fell in love with another
culture, a phenomenon as old as time. Never comfortable with the asceti-
cism of the Spartans, he found himself enthralled by the Persian love of

luxury and sensual pleasure. He put on Persian robes and perfumes with a
sense of deliverance from Greek discipline and
                                                 simplicity.

KEYS TO POWER
We all tell lies and hide our true feelings, for complete free expression is a
social impossibility. From an early age we learn to conceal our thoughts,
telling the prickly and insecure what we know they want to hear, watching
carefully lest we otfend them. For most of us this is natural—there are ideas
and values that most people accept, and it is pointless to argue. We believe
what we want to, then, but on the outside we wear a mask.
   There are people, however, who see such restraints as an intolerable
infringement on their freedom, and who have a need to prove the superi-

                                           them: Many of the converts lived their outward lives as Catholics, yet
                                           somehow managed to retain their Jewish beliefs, practicing the religion in

                                           doxies are gone. Jonas Salk, for instance, thought science had gotten past

                                           politics and protocol. And so, in his search for a polio vaccine, he broke all
                                           the rules--going public with a discovery before showing it to the scientific
                                           community, taking credit for the vaccine without acknowledging the scien-
                                           tists who had paved the way, making himself a star. The public may have
                                           loved him but scientists shunned him. His disrespect for his community’s
                                           orthodoxies left him isolated, and he wasted years trying to heal the
                                           breach, and struggling for funding and cooperation.
                                                 Bertolt Brecht underwent a modern form of Inquisition—tl1e House


3.12       LAW 38
Un—American Activities Committee-and approached it with considerable
canniness. Having worked off and on in the American film industry during
World War II, in 1947 Brecht was summoned to appear before the commit-
tee to answer quesfions on his suspected Communist sympathies.          Other
writers called before the committee made a point of attacking its members,
and of acting as belligerently as possible in order to gain sympathy for
themselves. Brecht, on the other hand, who had actually worked stead»
lastly for the Communist cause, played the opposite game: He answered
questions with ambiguous generalities that defied easy interpretation. Call
it the Carnpanella strategy. Brecht even were a suit————a rare event for him—-
and made a point of smoking a cigar during the proceedings, knowing that
akey committee member had a passion for cigars. In the end he charmed
the committee members, who let him go scobfree.
    Brecht then moved to East Germany, where he encountered a differ-
ent kind of Inquisition. Here the Communists were in power, and they crit»
icized his plays as decadent and pessimistic. He did not argue with them,
but made small changes in the performance scripts to shut them up. Mean«
while he managed to preserve the published texts as written. His outward
conformity in both cases gave him the freedom to work unhindered, with
out having to change his thinking. In the end, he made his way safely

through dangerous times in different countries through the use of little
dances of orthodoxy, and proved he was more powerful than the forces of
repression.
    Not only do people of power avoid the offenses of Pausanias and Salk,

they also learn to play the clever fox and feign the common touch. This has
been the ploy of con artists and politicians throughout the centuries. Lead-
ers like
        Julius Caesar and Franklin D. Roosevelt have overcome their nab
ural aristocratic stance to cultivate a familiarity with the common man.
They have expressed this familiarity in little gestures, often symbolic, to
show the people that their leaders share popular values, despite their differ-
ent status.
    The logical extension of this practice is the invaluable ability to be all
things to all people. When you go into society, leave behind your own
ideas and values, and put on the mask that is most appropriate for the
group in which you find yourself. Bismarck played this game successfully
for yearsmthere were people who vaguely understood what he was up to,
but not clearly enough that it mattered. People will swallow the bait be-
cause it flatters them to believe that you share their ideas. They will not
take you as a hypocrite if you are careful~——for how can they accuse you of
hypocrisy if you do not let them know exactly what you stand for? Nor will
they see you as lacking in values. Of course you have values~——the values
you share with them, while in their company.


           Authority: Do not give dogs what is holy; and do not throw
           your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under
           foot and turn to attack you. Uesus Christ, Matthew 7:6)

                      The only time it is worth standing out is when you already stand out-
                      when you have achieved an unshakable position of power, and can display
                      your difference from others as a sign of the distance between you. As pres—
                      ident of the United States, Lyndon Johnson would sometimes hold meet-
                      ings while he sat on the toilet. Since no one else either could or would
                      claim such a “privilege,” Johnson was showing people that he did not have
                      to observe the protocols and nicefies of others. The Roman emperor

                      Caligula played the same game: He would wear a woman’s negligee, or a
                      bathrobe, to receive important visitors. He even went so far as to have his
                      horse elected consul. But it backfired, for the people hated Caligula, and
                      his gestures eventually brought his overthrow. The truth is that even those
                      who attain the heights of power would be better off at least affecting the
                      common   touch, for at some point they may need popular support.
                          Finally, there is always a place for the gadfly, the person who success-
                      fully defies custom and mocks what has grown lifeless in a culture. Oscar
                      Wilde, for example, achieved considerable social power on this founda-

                      when he gave public readings his audiences not only expected him to in-
                      sult them but welcomed it We notice, however, that his eccentric role
                      eventually destroyed him. Even had he come to a better end, remember
                      that he possessed an unusual genius: Without his gift to amuse and delight,
                      his barbs would simply have offended people.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
By the late 1920s, Haile Selassie had nearly achieved his goal of assuming
total control over Ethiopia, a country he felt needed strong and unified
leadership. As regent to the empress Zauditu (stepdaughter of the late
queen) and heir to the throne, Selassie had spent several years weakening
the power of Ethiopia’s various warlords. Now only one real obstacle stood

                                      Haile Selassie always saw several moves ahead. He knew that if he let Ras
                                      Gugsa decide the time and place of the revolt, the danger would be much
                                      greaier than if he forced Gngsa to act on Selassie’s terms. So he goaded him
                                      into rebellion by offending his manly pride, asking him to fight people he
                                      had no quarrel with on behalf of a man he hated. Thinking everything out

with so little selflcontrol.
    The answer, however, is not to repress our angry or emotional re
sponses. For repression drains us of energy and pushes us into strange be-
havior. lnstead we have to change our perspective: We have to realize that
nothing in the social realm, and in the game of power, is personal.
    Everyone is caught up in a chain of events that long predates the pre-
sent moment. Our anger often stems from problems in our childhood,
from the problems of our parents which stem from their own childhood, on
and on. Our anger also has roots in the many interactions with others, the
accumulated disappointments and heartaches that we have suffered. An in-
dividual will often appear as the instigator of our anger but it is much more
complicated, goes far beyond what that individual did to us. If a person ex-
plodes with anger at you (and it seems out of proportion to what you did to
them), you must remind yourself that it is not exclusively directed at you-—
do not be so vain. The cause is much larger, goes way bad: in time, in-
volves dozens of prior hurts, and is actually not worth the bother to
understand. Instead of seeing it as a personal grudge, look at the emotional
outburst as a disguised power move, an attempt to control or punish you
cloaked in the form of hurt feelings and anger.
     This shift of perspective will let you play the game of power with more
clarity and energy. Instead of overreasting, and becoming ensnared in pet)»

                                                                                             LAW 39             329
               ple’s emotions, you will turn their loss of control to your advantage: You
               keep your head while they are losing theirs.
                    During an important battle in the War of the Three Kingdoms, in the
               third century A.D., advisers to the commander Ts’ao Ts’ao discovered docu»
               ments showing that certain of his generals had conspired with the enemy,
               and urged him to arrest and execute them. Instead he ordered the docu-
               ments burned and the matter forgotten. At this critical moment in the bat-

               tle, to get upset or demand justice would have reverberated against him:
               An angry action would have called attention to the generals’ disloyalty,
               which would have harmed the troops’ morale. justice could wait-he
               would deal with the generals in time. Ts‘ao Ts’ao kept his head and made
               the right decision.
                   Compare this to Napoleon's response to Talleyrand: Instead of taking
               the conspiracy personally, the emperor should have played the game like
               Ts’ao Ts’ao, carefully weighing the consequences of any action he took.
               The more powerful response in the end would have been to ignore Tal~

               leyr-and, or to bring the minister gradually back to his side and punish him
               later.

                    Anger only cuts off our options, and the powerful cannot thrive with
               out options. Once you train   yourself not to take matters personally, and to
               control your emotional responses, you will have placed yourself in a posi-
               tion of tremendous power: Now you can play with the emotional responses
               of other people. Stir the insecure into action by impugning their manhood,
               and by dangling the prospect of an easy victory before their faces. Do as
               Houdini did when challenged by the less successful escape artist Kleppini:
               Reveal an apparent weakness (Houdini let Kleppini steal the combination
               for a pair of cuffs) to hire your opponent into action. Then you can beat
               him with ease. With the arrogant too you can appear weaker than you are,

               taunting them into a rash action.
                    Sun Pin, commander of the armies of Ch’i and loyal disciple of Sun-
               tzu, once led his troops against the armies of Wei, which outnumbered him
               two to one.   “Let us light a hundred thousand fires when our army enters
               Wei,” suggested Sun Pin, “fifty thousand on the next day, and only thirty
               thousand on the third.” On the third day the Wei general exclaimed, “I
               knew the men of Ch’i were cowards, and after only three days more than
               half of them have deserted!” So, leaving behind his slow-moving heavy in
               fantry, the general decided to seize the moment and move swiftly on the
               Ch’i camp with a lightly armed force. Sun Pin’s troops retreated, luring
               Wei’s army into a narrow pass, where they ambushed and destroyed them.
               With the Wei general dead and his forces decimated, Sun Pin now easily
               defeated the rest of his army.
                   In the face of a hot—headed enemy, finally, an excellent response is no

               response. Follow the Talleyrand tactic: Nothing is as infuriating as a man
               who keeps his cool while others are losing theirs. If it will work to your ad-
               vantage to unsettle people, affect the aristocratic, bored pose, neither
               mocking nor triumphant but simply indifferent. This will light their fuse.

When playing with people’s emotions you have to be careful. Study the
enemy beforehand: Some fish are best left at the bottom of the pond.
   The leaders of the city of Tyre, capital of ancient Phoenicia, felt confl-
dent they could withstand Alexander the Great, who had conquered the
Oiient but had not attacked their city, which stood well protected on the
water.    They sent ambassadors to Alexander saying that although they
would recognize him as emperor they would not allow him or his forces to
enter Tyre. This of course enraged him, and he              immediately mounted a
siege. For four months the city withstood him, and finally he decided that
the struggle was not worth it, and that he would come to terms with the
Tyrians. But they, feeling that they had already baited Alexander and got-
ten away with it, and confident that they could withstand him, refused to



                                                                                    LAW 39   331
                   negotiate«—-in. fact they killed his messengers,
                       This pushed Alexander over the edge. Now it did not matter to him
                   how long the siege lasted or how large an army it needed; he had the re-
                   sources, and would do whatever it took He remounted his assault so siren-

                   uously that he captured Tyre within days, burned it to the ground, and sold
                   its people into slavery.
                        You can bait the powerful and get them to commit and divide their
                   forces as Sun Pin did, but test the waters first. Find the gap in their strength.
                   If there is no gap--if they are impossibly strong——you have nothing to gain
                   and everything to lose by provoking them. Choose carefully whom you
                   bait, and never stir up the sharks.
                        Finally there are times when a we1l—timed burst of anger can do you
                   good, but your anger must be manufactured and under your control. Then
                   you can determine exactly how and on whom it will fall. Never stir up re
                   actions that will work against you in the long run. And use your thunder
                   bolts rarely, to make them the more intimidating and meaningful. Whether
                   purposefully staged or not, if your outbursts come too often, they will lose
                   their power.

begged him to sell him the cup, which must clearly be valuable if Fushimiya

vertently caused this man pain by making him believe the cup had great
worth, paid him 100 ryo (gold pieces) for the cup as a kindness. The cup
was   indeed mediocre, but he wanted to rid the artisan of his obsession,
while also allowing him to feel that his effort had not been wasted. The ar-
tisan thanked him and went on his way.
     Soon word spread of Fushimiya’s purchase of the teacup. Every dealer

injapan clamored for him to sell it, since a cup he had bought for 100 ryo
must be worth much more. He tried to explain the circumstances in which
he had bought the cup, but the dealers could not be dissuaded. Fushimiya
finally relented and put the cup up for sale.

 high places can have no vice so harmful as avarice. A miserly man can
 conquer neither lands nor lordships, for he does not have a plentiful

          REVERSAL
          The powerful never forget that what is offered for free is inevitably a trick.
          Friends who offer favors without asking for payment will later want some

          thing far dearer than the money you would have paid them. The bargain
          has hidden problems, both material and psychological. Learn to pay, then,
          and to pay well.
              On the other hand, this Law offers great opportunities for swindling
          and deception if you apply it from the other side. Dangling the lure of at
          free lunch is the con artisfs stock in trade.
              No man was better at this than the most successful con artist of our

          age, Joseph Weil, a.k.a. “The Yellow Kid.” The Yellow Kid learned early
          that what made his swindles possible was his fellow humans’ greed. “This
          desire to get something for nothing,” he once wrote, “has been very costly
          to many people who have dealt with me and with other can men.             ,   .   .




          When people lea.rn——a3 I doubt they will—that they can’t get something
          for nothing, crime will diminish and we shall all live in greater harmony.”
          Over the years Weil devised many ways to seduce people with the prospect
          of easy money. He would hand out “free” real estate——who could resist
          such an offer?——and then the suckers would learn they had to pay $25 to

          register the sale. Since the land was free, it seemed worth the high fee, and
          the Yellow Kid would make thousands of dollars on the phony registration.
          In exchange he would give his suckers a phony deed. Other times, he
          would tell suckers about a fixed horse race, or a stock that would earn 200
          percent in a few weeks. As he spun his stories he would watch the sucker’s
          eyes open wide at the thought of a free lunch.
              The lesson is simple: Bait your deceptions with the possibility of easy

          money. People are essentially lazy, and want wealth to fall in their lap
          rather than to work for it. For at small sum, sell them advice on how to
          make millions (P. T. Barnum did this later in life), and that small sum will
          become a fortune when multiplied by thousands of suckers. Lure people in
          with the prospect of easy money and you have the room to work still more

          deceptions on them, since greed is powerful enough to blind your victims
          to anything. And as the Yellow Kid said, half the fun is teaching a moral
          lesson: Greed does not pay.

                   When Pericles of Athens was about to launch a career as a statesman,
               he looked for the one thing that was missing in Athenian politics. Most of
               the great politicians of his time had allied themselves with the aristocracy;
               indeed Pericles himself had aristocratic tendencies. Yet he decided to throw
               in his hat with the city’s democratic elements. The choice had nothing to
               do with his personal beliefs, but it launched him on a brilliant career. Out
               of necessity he became a man of the people. Instead of compefing in an
               arena    filled with great leaders both past and present, he would make a
               name for himself where no shadows could obscure his
                                                                 presence.
                   When the painter Diego de Velazquez began his career, he knew he
               could not compete in refinement and technique with the great Renaissance
               painters who had come before him. Instead he chose to work in a style that
               by the standards of the time seemed coarse and rough, in a way that had
               never been seen before. And in this style he excelled. There were mem-

               bers of the Spanish court who wanted to demonstrate their own break with
               the past; the newness of Velé.zquez’s style thrilled them. Most people are
               afraid to break so boldly with tradition, but they secretly admire those who
               can break up the old forms and reinvigorate the culture. This is why there

               is so much power to be gained from entering vacuums and voids.
                   There is a kind of stubborn stupidity that recurs throughout history,
               and is a strong impediment to power: The superstitious belief that if the
               person before you succeeded by doing A, B, and C, you can re-create their
               success
                       by doing the same thing. This cookie-cutter approach will seduce
               the uncreative, for it is easy, and appeals to their timidity and their laziness.
               But circumstances never repeat themselves exactly.
                   When General Douglas MacArthur assumed command of American
               forces in the Philippines during World War II, an assistant handed him a
               book containing the various precedents established by the commanders
               before him, the methods that had been successful for them. MacArthur
               asked the assistant how many copies there were of this book. Six, the assis-
               tant answered. “Well,” the general replied, “you get all those six copies to-

               gether and burn them—-every one of them. I’ll not be ‘bound by
               precedents. Any time a problem comes up, I’ll make the decision at
               once—immediately.” Adopt this ruthless strategy toward the past: Bum all
               the books, and train yourself to react to circumstances as they happen.
                   You may believe that you have separated yourself from the predeces
               sor or father figure, but as you grow older you must be eternally vigilant
               lest you become the father you had rebelled against. As a young man, Mao

               Tse-tung disliked his father and in the struggle against him found his own
               identity and a new set of values. But as he aged, his father’s ways crept back
               in. Mao’s father had valued manual work over intellect; Mao had scoffed at
               this as a young man, but as he grew older he unconsciously returned to his
               father’s views and echoed such outdated ideas by forcing a whole genera.»

cost his regime dearly. Remember: You are your own father. Do not let
yourself spend years creating yourself only to let your guard down and
allow the ghost of the past—father, habit, history—to sneak back in.

    Finally, as noted in the story of Louis XV, plenitude and prosperity
tend to make us lazy and inactive: When our power is secure we have no
need to act. This is a serious danger, especially for those who achieve suc-
cess and
          power at an early age. The playwright Tennessee Williams, for in-
stance, found himself skyrocketed from obscurity to fame by the success of
The Glass Menagerie. “The sort of life which I had had previous to this popuv
lar success,” he later wrote, “was one that required endurance, a life of
clawing and scratching, but it was a good life because it was the sort of life
for which the human organism is created. I was not aware of how much
vital energy had gone into this struggle until the struggle was removed.
This was security at last. I sat down and looked about me and was suddenly
very depressed.” Williams had a nervous breakdown, which may in fact
have been necessary for him: Pushed to the psychological edge, he could
start writing with the oldvitality again, and he produced A Streetcar Named
Desire.Fyodor  Dostoyevsky,     similarly, whenever he wrote a successful
novel, would feel that the financial security he had gained made the act of
creation unnecessary. He would take his entire savings to the casino and
would not leave until he had gambled away his last penny. Once reduced
to poverty he could write again.
     It is not necessary to go to such extremes, but you must be prepared to
return to square one   psychologically rather than growing fat and lazy with
prosperity. Pablo Picasso could deal with success, but only by constantly
changing the style of his painting, often breaking completely with what
had made him successful before. How often our early triumphs turn us
into a kind of caricature of ourselves. Powerful people recognize these

traps; like Alexander the Great, they struggle constantly to re—create them-
selves. The father must. not be allowed to return; he must be slain at every

step of the way.

                       are
                           many. At every cross-

                       and step out of his shadow.

                The shadow of a great predecessor could be used to advantage if it is cho-
                sen as a   trick, a tactic that can be discarded once it has brought you power
                Napoleon III used the name and legend of his illustrious grand-uncle
                Napoleon Bonaparte to help him become first president and then emperor
                of France. Once on the throne, however, he did not stay tied to the past’, he
                quickly showed how different his reign would be, and was careful to keep
                the public from expecting him to attain the heights that Bonaparte had at-
                tained.
                      The past often has elements worth appropriating, qualities that would
                be foolish to reject out of a need to distinguish yourself. Even Alexander
                the Great recognized and was influenced by his father’s skill in organizing
                an
                     army. Making a display of doing things differently from your predeces-
                sor can make
                              you seem childish and in fact out of control, unless your ac-
                tions have a logic of their own.

                    Joseph II, son of the Austrian empress Maria Theresa, made a show of
                doing the exact opposite of his mother—dressing like an ordinary citizen,
                staying in inns instead of palaces, appearing as the “people’s emperor”
                Maria Theresa, on the other hand, had been regal and aristocratic. The

                problem was that she had also been beloved, an empress who ruled wisely

and instinct that will point you in the right direction, playing the rebel will
not be dangerous. But if you are mediocre,    as_]0sepl’1 II was in comparison
to his mother, you   are   better oi? learning from your predecessor’s knowl-

edge and experience, which are based on something real.
     Finally, it is often wise to keep an eye on the young, your future rivals
in power. just as you try to rid yourself of your father, they will soon play
the same trick on you, clenigrating everything you have accornplished._]ust
as
   you rise by rebelling against the past, keep an eye on those rising from
below, and never give them the chance to do the same to you.
     The great Baroque artist and architect Pietro Bemini was a master at

sniffing out younger potential rivals and keeping them in his shadow. One
day a young stonemason named Francesco Boiromini showed Bernini his
architectural sketches. Recognizing his talent immediately, Bernini in-
stantly hired Borromini as his assistant, which delighted the young man but
was actually
              only a tactic to keep him close at hand, so that he could play
psychological games on him and create in him a kind of inferiority com~
plex. And indeed, despite Borromini’s brilliance, Bernini has the greater
fame. His strategy with Boirornini he made a lifelong practice: Fearing that
the great sculptor Alessandro Algardi, for example, would eclipse him in
fame, he arranged it so that Algardi could only find work as his assistant.
And any assistant who rebelled against Bernini and tried to strike out on
his own would find his career ruined.

     Florence was divided by two rival factions, the Blacks and the Whites.     A5501‘.

The Whites were the merchant families that had recently and quickly
risen to power and wealth; the Blacks were the older money. Because of
their popularity with the people, the Whites retained control of the city, to
the Blacks’ increasing resentment. The feud between the two grew steadily
more bitter.

    Here Boniface saw his chance: He would plot to help the Blacks take
over the
           city, and Florence would be in his pocket. And as he studied the
situation he began to focus on one man, Dante Alighieri, the celebrated

writer, poet, and ardent supporter of the Whites. Dante had always been
interested in politics. He believed passionately in the republic, and often
chastised his fellow citizens for their lack of spine. He also happened to be
the city’s most eloquent public speaker. In 1300, the year Boniface began

plotting to take over Tuscany, Dante’s fellow citizens had voted him in to
Florence’s highest elected position, making him one of the city’s six pri-
ors. During his six-month term in the
                                        post, he had stood firmly against the
Blacks and against all of the pope’s attempts to sow disorder.
     By 1301, however, Boniface had a new plan: He called in Charles de
Valois, powerful brother of the king of France, to help bring order to Tus»
cany. As Charles marched through northern Italy, and Florence seethed
with anxiety and fear, Dante quickly emerged as the man who could rally

KEYS TO POWER
In the past, an entire nation would be ruled by a king and his handful of
ministers. Only the elite had any power to play with. Over the centuries,

power has gradually become more and more diffused and democratized.
This has created, however, a common misperception that groups no
longer have centers of power——-that power is spread out and scattered
among many people. Actually, however, power has changed in its num-
bers but not in its essence. There may be fewer mighty tyrants command
ing the power of life and death over millions, but there remain thousands
of petty tyrants ruling smaller realms, and enforcing their will through in-
direct power games, charisma, and so on. In every group, power is con-
centrated in the hands of one or two people, for this is one area in which
human nature will never change: People will congregate around a single

strong personality like planets orbiting a sun.
      To labor under the illusion that this kind of power center no longer
exists is to make endless mistakes, waste energy and time, and never hit
the target. Powerful people never waste time. Outwardly they may play
along with the game-—pretending that power is shared among manymbut
inwardly they keep their eyes on the inevitable few in the group who hold
the cards. These are the ones they work on, When troubles arise, they
look for the underlying cause, the single strong character who started the

stirring and whose isolation or banishment will settle the waters again.
      In his fami1y~therapy practice, Dr. Milton H. Erickson found that if
the family dynamic was unsettled and dysfunctional there was inevitably
one
   person who was the stirrer, the troublemaker. In his sessions he would
symbolically isolate this rotten apple by seating him or her apart from the
others, if only by a few feet. Slowly the other family members would see
the physically separate person as the source of their difficulty. Once you

recognize who the stirrer is, pointing it out to other people will accomplish
a
  great deal. Understanding who controls the group dynamic is a critical
realization. Remember: Stirrers thrive by hiding in the group, disguising
their actions among the reactions of others. Render their actions visible
and they lose their power to upset.
    A key element in games of strategy is isolating the enemy’s power. In
chess you try to comer the king. In the Chinese game of go you try to iso~
late the enemy’s forces in small pockets, rendering them immobile and in-
effectual. It is often better to isolate your enemies than       to
                                                                      destroy

                                                                                LAW 42   363
                   them——you seem less brutal. The result, though, is the same, for in the
                   game of power, isolation spells death.
                       The most effective form of isolation is somehow to separate your vic-
                   tims from their power base. When Mao Tse—tung wanted to eliminate an

                   enemy in the ruling elite, he did not confront the person directly; be
                   silently and stealthily worked to isolate the man, divide his allies and turn
                   them away from him, shrink his support. Soon the man would vanish on
                   his own.
                       Presence and appearance have great import in the game of power. To
                   seduce, particularly in the beginning stages, you need to be constantly
                   present, or create the feeling that you are; if you are often out of sight, the
                   charm will wear oil”. Queen Ellzabeth’s prime minister, Robert Cecil,
                   had two main rivals: the queen’s favorite, the Earl of Essex, and her for-
                   mer favorite, Sir Walter Raleigh. He contrived to send them both on a

                   mission against Spain; with them away from the court he managed to

                   wrap his tentacles around the queen, secure his position as her top ad~
                   viser and weaken her affection for Raleigh and the earl. The lesson here
                   is twofold: First, your absence from the court spells danger for you, and

                   you should never leave the scene in a time of turmoil, for your absence
                   can both symbolize and induce a loss of power; second, and on the other

                   hand, luring your enemies away from the court at critical moments is a
                   great ploy.
                       Isolation has other strategic uses. When trying to seduce people, it is
                   often wise to isolate them from their usual social context. Once isolated
                   they are vulnerable to you, and your presence becomes magnified. Simi-
                   larly, con artists often look for ways to isolate their marks from their nor
                   mal social milieux, steering them into new environments in which they
                   are no
                           longer comfortable. Here they feel weak, and succumb to decep~
                   tion more easily. Isolation, then, can prove a powerful way of bringing

                   people under your spell to seduce or swindle them.
                        You will often find powerful people who have alienated themselves
                   from the group. Perhaps their power has gone to their heads, and they
                   consider themselves superior; perhaps they have lost the knack of com-
                   municating with ordinary folk. Remember: This makes them vulnerable.
                   Powerful though they be, people like this can be turned to use.
                        The monk Rasputin gained his power over Czar Nicholas and Czar-
                   ina Alexandra of Russia through their tremendous isolation from the peo-

                   ple. Alexandra in particular was a foreigner, and especially alienated
                   from everyday Russians; Rasputin used his peasant origins to insinuate
                   himself into her good graces, for she desperately wanted to communicate
                   with her subjects. Once in the court’s inner circle, Rasputin made himself
                   indispensable and attained great power. Heading straight for the center,
                   he aimed for the one figure in Russia who commanded power (the czarina
                   dominated her husband), and found he had no need to isolate her for the
                   work was already done. The Rasputin strategy can bring you great power:

     Finally, the reason you strike at the shepherd is because such an ac-
tion will djshearten the sheep beyond any rational measure. When Het-
nando Cortes and Francisco Pizarro led their tiny forces against the Aztec
and Incan empires, they did not make the mistake of fighting on several
fronts, nor were they intimidated by the numbers arrayed against them;
they captured the kings, Moctezuma and Atahualpa. Vast empires fell
into their hands. With the leader gone the center of gravity is gone; there
is nothing to revolve around and everything falls apart. Aim at the lead-

ers, bring them down, and look for the endless opportunities in the confu-
sion that will ensue.

                     Andrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln’s successor as U.S.      president,
               saw
                    Ulysses S. Grant as a troublesome member of his government. So he
               isolated Grant, as a prelude to forcing him out. This only enraged the
               great general, however, who responded by forming a support base in the
               Republican party and going on to become the next president. It would
               have been far wiser to keep a man like Grant in the fold, where he could
               do less harm, than to make him revengeful. And so you may often find it
               better to keep people on your side, where you can watch them, than to
               risk creating an angry enemy. Keeping them close, you can secretly whit-

               loose they will fall fast and hard without knowing what hit them.

                                    gave him a gift of a horse and saddle. When angry lieutenants wondered
                                    why he did this, Liang told them, “I can capture that man as easily as I can

Liang. “But if I capture you again, I will not release you.”
      Now Menghuo and his soldiers fled to a far corner of their kingdom,
the region of Wuge. Defeated so many times, Menghuo had only one hope
left: He would ask the help of King Wutugu of Wuge, who had an immense
and ferocious army. Wutugu’s warriors wore an armor of tightly woven

                                         KEYS TO POWER
                                         In the game of power, you are surrounded by people who have absolutely
                                         no reason to
                                                       help you unless it is in their interest to do so. And if you have
                                         nothing to offer their selfiinterest, you are likely to make them hostile, for
                                         they will see in you just one more competitor, one more waster of their
                                         time. Those that overcome this prevailing coldness are the ones who find
                                         the key that unlocks the stra.nger’s head and mind, seducing him into their
                                         corner, if necessary sofiening him up for a punch. But most people never
                                         learn this side of the game. Vlrhen they meet someone new, rather than
                                         stepping back and probing to see what makes this person unique, they talk
                                         about themselves, eager to impose their own willpower and prejudices.
                                         They argue, boast, and make a show of their power. They may not know it
                                         but they are secretly creating an enemy, a resistor, because there is no
                                         more infuriating feeling than having your individuality ignored, your own

                                         psychology unacknowledged. It makes you feel lifeless and resentful.
                                              Remember: The key to persuasion is softening people up and break-
                                         ing them down, gently. Seduce them with a two—pronged approach: Work
                                         on   their emotions and play on their intellectual weaknesses. Be alert to
                                         both what separates them from everyone else (their individual psychology)
                                         and what they share with everyone else (their basic emotional responses).
                                         Aim at the primary emotions——love, hate, jealousy. Once you move their
                                         emotions you have reduced their control, making them more vulnerable to

                                         persuasion.
                                             When Chuko Liang wanted to dissuade an important general of a rival
                                         kingdom from entering into an alliance with Ts’ao Ts’ao, Liang’s dreaded
                                         enemy, he did not detail "rm; Ts’ao’s cruelty, or attack him on moral
                                         grounds. Instead Liang suggested that Ts’ao Ts’ao was really after the gen»

                  LAW 43
eral’s beautiful young wife. This hit the general in the gut, and won him
over.   Mao Tse—tung similarly always appealed to popular emotions, and

spoke in the simplest terms. Educated and well—rea.d himself, in his
speeches he used visceral metaphors, voicing the public’s deepest amdelies
and encouraging them to vent their frustrations in public meetings. Rather
than arguing the practical aspects of a. particular program, he would de~
scribe how it would affect them on the most primitive, down—to—earth level.
Do not believe that this approach works only with the illiterate and un-
sch0oled—it works on one and all. All of us are mortal and face the same
dreadful fate, and all of us share the desire for attachment and belonging.
Stir up these emotions and you captivate our hearts.
    The best way to do this is with a dramatic jolt, of the kind that Chuko
Liang created when be fed and released prisoners who expected only the
worst from him. Shaking them to the core, he softened their hearts. Play on
contrasts like this: Push people to despair, then give them relief. If they ex~

pect pain and you give them pleasure, you win their hearts. Creating plea-
sure of any kind, in fact, will
                                usually bring you success, as will allaying fears
and providing or promising security.
     Symbolic gestures are often enough to win sympathy and goodwill. A
gesture of self—sacri.fice, for example--a show that you suffer as those
around you do—will make people identify with you, even if your suffering
is symbolic or minor and theirs is real. When you enter a group, make a

gesture of goodwill; soften the group up for the harsher actions that will fol-
low later.
    When T. E. Lawrence was fighting the Turks in the deserts of the Mid-
dle East during World War I, he had an epiphany: It seemed to him that
Conventional warfare had lost its value. The old-fashioned soldier was lost
in the enormous amiies of the time, in which he was ordered about like a
lifeless pawn. Lawrence wanted to turn this around. For him, every sol-
dier’s mind was a kingdom he had to conquer. A committed, psychologi-
cally motivated soldier would fight harder and more creatively than a.
puppet.
    Lawrence’s perception is still more true in the world today, where so
many of us feel alienated, anonymous, and suspicious of authority, all of
which makes overt power plays and force even more counterproductive
and dangerous. Instead of manipulating lifeless pawns, make those on your
side convinced and excited by the cause you have enlisted them in; this
will not only make your work easier but it will also give you more leeway
to deceive them later on. And to      accomplish this you need to deal with
their individual psychologies. Never clumsily assume that the tactic that
worked on one person will necessarily work on another. To find the key
that will motivate them, first get them to open up. The more they talk, the
more    they reveal about their likes and dislikes--the handles and levers to
move them with.

    The quickest way to secure people’s minds is by demonstrating, as

simply as possible, how an action will benefit them. Self—interest is the

                                                                                             ‘



                                                                                    LAW 43       3'73
                 strongest motive of all: A great cause may capture minds, but once the firs:
                 flush of excitement is over, interest will flag--unless there is something to
                 be gained. Self-interest is the solider foundation. The causes that work best
                 use a noble veneer to cover a blatant        appeal to self-interest; the cause se-
                 duces but the self-interest secures the deal.
                     The people who are best at appealing to people’s minds are often
                 artists, intellectuals, and those of a more poetic nature. This is because
                 ideas are most easily communicated through metaphors and imagery. It is
                 always good policy, then, to have in your pocket at least one artist or intel~
                 lectual who can appeal concretely to people’s minds. Kings have always
                 kept a stable of writers in their ham: Frederick the Great had his Voltaire
                 (until they quaneled and separated), Napoleon won over Goethe. Con-
                 versely, Napoleon III’s alienation of writers such as Victor Hugo, whom he
                 exiled from France, contributed to his growing unpopularity and eventual
                 downfall. It is dangerous, then, to alienate those who have powers of ex»
                 pression, and useful to pacify and exploit them.
                      Finally, learn to play the numbers game‘ The wider your support base
                 the stronger your power. Understanding that one alienated, disaffected
                 soul can spark a blaze of discontent, Louis XIV made sure to endear him-
                 self to the lowest members of his staff. You too must constantly win over
                 more allies on all levels-we time will    inevitably come when you will need
                 them.

        DISARM AND INFURIATE


      WITH THE MIRROR EFFECT



      jUDGMENT
      The mirror reflects reality, but it is alxo the perfect toalfor

      deception: When you minm your enemies, doing exactly
      as
         they do, they cannot figure out your strategy. The Mir-
      1m*Efi"ect mocks and humiliates them, making them over-
      react. By holding up a mirmr to thelrpsyches, you seduce

      them with the illusion that you share their values; by

      holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a

Early on in his career, the ambitious statesman and general Alcibiades of
Athens (450—404 8.0) fashioned a formidable weapon that became the
source of his
            power. In every encounter with others, he would sense their
moods and tastes, then carefully tailor his words and actions to mirror their
inmost desires. He would seduce them with the idea that their values were

tors. But he also tailored his words to reflect older men's nostalgia for the

glory years when Athens led the Greeks against Persia, and then went on to
create an empire. All Athens now dreamed of conquering           Sicily; Alcibi-
ades’ plan was approved, and he was made the expedition’s commander.
     While Alcibiades was leading the invasion of Sicily, however, certain
Athenians fabricated charges against him of profaning sacred statues. He
knew his enemies would have him executed if he returned home, so at the
last minute he deserted the Athenian fleet and defected to Athens’s bitter
enemy, Sparta. The Spartans welcomed this great man to their side, but
they knew his reputation and were wary of him. Alcibiades loved luxury;
the Spartans were a warrior people who worshipped austerity, and they
were afraid he would   corrupt their youth. But much to their relief, the Al~

love, the deeds of great knights, the nobility of past kings and heroes. She
led his thirst for glory by creating an image of an august, superior king
whom he could aspire to become. She stirred his imagination.
       As the future Sun King spent more and more time in Matie’s presence,
it   eventually became clear that he had fallen in love with the least likely
young woman of the court. To the horror of her sisters and mother, he
showered Marie Mancini with attention. He brought her along on his mili-
taiy campaigns, and made a show of stationing her where she could watch
as   he marched into battle. He even promised Marie that he would marry
her and make her queen.
       Mazarin, however, would never allow the king to many his niece, a
woman who could       bring France no diplomatic or royal alliances. Louis had
to marry a princess of    Spain or Austria. In 1658 Louis succumbed to the
pressure and agreed to break off the first romantic involvement of his life.
He did so with much regret, and at the end of his life he acknowledged that
he never loved anyone as much as Marie Mancini.

                                                                                            LAW 4 4          383
                Interpretation
                Marie Mancini played the seducer’s game to perfection. First, she took a

                step back, to study her prey. Seduction often fails to get past the first step
                because it is too aggressive; the first move must always be a retreat. By

                studying the king from a distance Marie saw what distinguished him from
                others»-—his high ideals, romantic nature, and snobbish disdain for petty
                politics. Marie’s next step was to make a mirror for these hidden yearnings
                on Louis’s
                            part, letting him glimpse what he himself could be——-a godlike
                king!
                     This mirror had several functions: Satisfying Louis’s ego by giving him
                a double to look at, it also focused on him so
                                                                exclusively as to give him the
                feeling that Marie existed for him alone. Surrounded by a pack of schem~
                ing courtiers who only had their own self—interest at heart, he could not fail
                to be touched by this devotional focus. Finally Marie-’s mirror set up an
                ideal for him to live up to: the noble knight of the medieval court. To a soul
                both romantic and ambitious, nothing could be more intoxicating than to
                have someone hold up an idealized reflection of him. In effect it was Marie
                Mancini who created the image of the Sun King——indeed Louis later ad»
                mitted the enormous part she had played in fashioning his radiant self»

                image.
                     This is the power of the Seducefs Mirror: By doubling the tastes and
                ideals of the target, it shows your attention to his or her psychology, an at-
                tention more charming than any aggressive pursuit. Find out what sets the
                other person apart, then hold up the mirror that will reflect it and bring it
                out of them. Feed their fantasies of power and greatness   by reflecting their
                ideals, and they will succumb.

                Observance IV
                In 1538, with the death of his mother, Helena, the eight-year-old future
                czar Ivan IV (or Ivan the Terrible) of Russia became an orphan. For the

                next five years he watched as the princely class, the boyars, terrorized the
                country. Now and then, to mock the young Ivan, they would make him
                wear a crown and
                                    scepter and place him on the throne. VVhen the little
                                   over the
                boy's feet dangled          edge of the chair, they would laugh and lift him
                off it, handing him from man to man in the air, making him feel his help
                lessness compared to them.
                    When Ivan was thirteen, he boldly murdered the boyar leader and as-
                cended to the throne. For the next few decades he struggled to subdue the
                boyars’ power, but they continued to defy him. By 1575 his efforts to trans-
                form Russia and defeat its enemies had exhausted him. Meanwhile, his

                subjects were complaining bitterly about his endless wars, his secret police,
                the unvanquished and oppressive boyars. His own ministers began to ques-
                tion his moves. Finally he had had enough. In 1564 he had temporarily
                abandoned the throne, forcing his subjects to call him back to power. Now
                he took the strategy a step further, and abdicated.
                    To take his place Ivan elevated a general of his, Simeon Bekbulatovich,


384   LAW 41¢
to the throne. But   although Simeon had recently converted to Christianity,
he was by birth a Tartar, and his enthronement was an insult to Ivan’s sub-
jects, since Russians looked down on the Tartars as inferiors and infidels.
Yet Ivan ordered that all Russians, including the boyars, pledge obedience
to their new ruler. And while Simeon moved into the Kremlin, Ivan lived

in a humble house on Moscow’s outskirts, from which he would sometimes
\n‘sit the palace, bow before the throne, sit among the other boyars, and

humbly petition Simeon for favors.
       Over time it became clear that Simeon was a kind of kings double. He
dressed like Ivan, and acted like Ivan, but he had no real power, since no
one would
           really obey him. The boyars at the court who were old enough
to remember taunting Ivan    when he was a boy, by placing him on the
throne, saw  the connection:  They had made Ivan feel like a weak pre-
tender, so now  he mirrored them by placing a weak pretender of his own
on the throne.

       For two long years Ivan held the mirror of Simeon up to the Russian

people. The mirror said: Your whining and disobedience have made me a
czar   with no real power, so I will reflect back to you a czar with no real

power. You have treated me disrespectfully, so I will do the same to you,
making Russia the laughingstock of the world. In 1577, in the name of the
Russian people, the chastised boyars once again begged Ivan to return to
the throne, which he did. He lived as czar until his death, in 1584, and the
conspiracies, complaining, and second—guessing disappeared along with
Simeon.
Interpretation
In 15 64, after threatening to abdicate, Ivan had been granted absolute pow-
ers.   But these powers had slowly been chipped away as every sector of so-

ciety—the boyars, the church, the government—vied for more control.
Foreign wars had exhausted the country, internal bickering had increased,
and Ivan’s attempts to respond had been met with scorn. Russia had turned
into a kind of boisterous classroom in which the pupils laughed openly at
the teacher. If he raised his voice or complained, he only met more resis-
tance. He had to teach them a lesson, give them a taste of their own medi-

cine. Simeon Bekbulatovich was the mirror he used to do so.
       After two years in which the throne had been an object of ridicule and
disgust, the Russian people learned their lesson. They wanted their czar
back, conceding to him all the dignity and respect that the position should
always have commanded. For the rest of his reign, Russia and Ivan got
along fine.
    Understand: People are locked in their own experiences. When you
whine about some insensitivity on their part, they may seem to understand,
but inwardly they are untouched and even more resistant. The goal of

power is always to lower people’s resistance to you. For this you need
tricks, and one trick is to teach them a lesson.
     Instead of haranguing people verbally, then, create a kind of mirror of
their behavior, In doing so you leave them two choices: They can ignore



                                                                                LAW 44
               you, or they can start to think about themselves. And even if they ignore
               you, you will have planted a seed in their unconscious that will eventually
               take root. When you mirror their behavior, incidentally, do not be afraid to
               add a touch of caricature and exaggeration, as Ivan did by enthroning a
               TaItar—it is the little spice in the soup that will open their eyes and make
               them see the ridiculousness in their own actions.


               Observance V
               Dr. Milton H. Erickson, a pioneer in strategic psychotherapy, would often
               educate his patients powerfully but indirectly by creating a kind of mirror
               effect. Constructing an analogy to make patients see the truth on their own,
               he would bypass their resistance to change. When Dr. Erickson treated
               married couples complaining of sexual problems, for instance, he often
               found that psychotherapy’s tradition of direct confrontation and problem-

               airing only heightened the spouses’ resistance and sharpened their differ-
               ences.  Instead, he would draw a husband and wife out on other topics,
               often banal ones, trying to find an analogy for the sexual conflict.
                    In one couple’s first session, the pair were discussing their eating
               habits, especially at dinner. The wife preferred the leisurely approach——a
               drink before the meal, some appetizers, and then a small main course, all at
               a slow, civilized
                                 pace. This frustrated the husband-—he wanted to get din-
               ner over
                          quickly and to dig right into the main course, the bigger the better.
               As the conversation continued, the couple began to catch glimpses of an

               analogy to their problems in bed. The moment they made this connection,
               however, Dr. Erickson would change the subject, carefully avoiding a dis-
               cussion of the real problem.
                   The couple thought Erickson was just getting to know them and would
               deal with the problem directly the next time he saw them. But at the end of
               this first session, Dr. Erickson directed them to arrange a dinner a few
               nights away that would combine each person’s desire: The wife would get
               the slow meal, including time spent bonding, and the husband would get
               the big dishes he wanted to eat. Without realizing they were acting under
               the doctor’s gentle guidance, the couple would walk into a mirror of their
               problem, and in the mirror they would solve their problems themselves,
               ending the evening just as the doctor had h0ped—by mirroring the im-
               proved dinner dynamics in bed.
                    In dealing with more severe problems, such as the schizophrenids
               mirror fantasy world of his or her own construction, Dr. Erickson would al-

               ways try to enter the mirror and work within it, He once treated a hospital
               inmate who believed he was Jesus Christ-—draping sheets around his

               body, talking in vague parables, and bombarding staff and patients with
               endless Christian proselytizing. No therapy or drugs seemed to work, until
               one
                    day Dr. Erickson went up to the young man and said, “I understand
               you have had experience as a carpenter.” Being Christ, the patient had to
               say that he had had such experience, and Erickson immediately put him to
               work building bookcases and other useful items, allowing him to wear his
               Jesus garb. Over the next weeks, as the patient worked on these projects,
386   LAW 44
his mind became less occupied with Jesus fantasies and more focused on
his labor. As the carpentry work took precedence, a psychic shift took ef-
fect: The religious fantasies remained, but faded comfortably into the back-
ground, allowing the man to fimction in society.
Interpretation
Communication depends on metaphors and symbols, which are the basis
of language itself. A metaphor is a kind of mirror to the concrete and real,
which it often expresses more clearly and deeply than a literal description
does. When you are dealing with the intractable willpower of other people,
direct communication often only heightens their resistance.
      This happens most clearly when you complain about people’s behav-
ior, particularly in sensitive areas such as their lovemaking. You will effect
a. far more lasting change if, like Dr. Erickson, you construct an analogy, a

symbolic mirror of the situation, and guide the other through it. As Christ
himself understood, talking in parables is often the best way to teach a les-
son, for it allows people to realize the truth on their own.
      When dealing with people who are lost in the reflections of fantasy
worlds (including a host of people who do not live in mental hospitals),
never
        try to push them into reality by shattering their mirrors. Instead,
enter their world and operate inside it, under their rules, gently guiding
them out of the hall of mirrors they have entered.


Observance VI
The great   sixteenth~century Japanese tea master Takeno Sho~o once
passed by a house and noticed a. young man watering flowers near his front
gate. Two things caught Sho—o’s attention——first, the graceful] way the man
performed his task; and, second, the stunningly beautiful rose of Sharon
blossoms that bloomed in the garden. He stopped and introduced himself
to the man, whose name was Sen no Rikyu. Sho—o wanted to stay, but he

had a prior engagement and had to hnny off. Before he left, however,
Rikyu invited him to take tea with him the following morning. Sho-o hap-
pily accepted.
     When Sho—o opened the garden gate the next day, he was horrified to
see that not a single flower remained. More than
                                                   anything else, he had
come to see the rose of Sharon blossoms that he had not had the time to ap

preciate the day before; now, disappointed, he started to leave, but at the
gate he stopped himself, and decided to enter Sen no Rikyu’s tea room. Im-
mediately inside, he stopped in his tracks and gazed in astonishment: Be-
fore him a vase hung from the ceiling, and in the vase stood a single rose of
Sharon blossom, the most beautiful in the garden. Somehow Sen no Rikyu
had read his guesfs thoughts, and, with this one eloquent gesture, had
demonstrated that this day guest and host would be in perfect harmony.
     Sen no Rikyu went on to become the most famous tea. master of all,
and his trademark was this uncanny ability to harmonize himself with his

guests’ thoughts and to think one step ahead, enchanting them by adapting
to their taste.
     One day Rjkyu was invited to tea by Yamashina Hechigwan, an ad-
                                                                                                 -1

               miter of the tea ceremony but also a man with a vivid sense of humor.
               When Rikyu arrived at Hechigwan’s home, he found the garden gate shut,
               so   he opened it to look for the host. On the other side of the gate he saw
               that someone had first dug a ditch, then carefully covered it over with can-
               vas and   earth. Realizing that Hechigwan had planned a practical joke, he
                obligingly walked right into the ditch, muddying his clothes in the process.
                     Apparently horrified, Hechigwan came running out, and hurried
                Rikyu to a bath that for some inexplicable reason stood already prepared.
               Afier bathing, Rikyu joined Hechigwan in the tea ceremony, which both

                enjoyed immensely, sharing a laugh about the accident. Later Sen no
                Rikyu explained to a friend that he had heard about Hechigwan’s practical
               joke beforehand, “But since it should always be one’s aim to conform to
                the wishes of one’s host, I fell into the hole knowingly and thus assured the
                success of the
                               meeting. Tea is by no means mere obsequiousness, but there
                is no tea where the host and guest are not in harmony with one another.”

                Hechigwan’s vision of the dignified Sen no Rikyu at the bottom of a ditch
                had pleased him endlessly, but Rikyu had gained a pleasure of his own
                in complying with his host’s wish and watching him amuse himself in
               this way.
               Interpretation
               Sen no Rikyu was no magician or seer~—-he watched those around him
               acutely, plumbing the subtle gestures that revealed a hidden desire, then
               producing that desire’s image. Although Sho—o never spoke of being en-
               chanted by the rose of Sharon blossoms, Rikyu read it in his eyes. If mir-
               roring a person’s desires meant falling into a ditch, so be it. Rikyu’s power
               resided in his skillful use of the Courtier’s Mirror, which gave him the ap-
               pearance of an unusual ability to see into other people.
                   Learn to manipulate the Courtier’s Mirror, for it will bring you great

               power. Study people’s eyes, follow their gestures—-«surer barometers of pain
               and pleasure than any spoken word. Notice and remember the details-«the

               clothing, the choice of friends, the daily habits, the tossed-out remarks-—
               that reveal hidden and rarely indulged desires. Soak it all in, find out what
               lies under the surface, then make yourself the mirror of their unspoken
               selves. That is the key to this power: The other person has not asked for
               your consideration, has not mentioned his pleasure in the rose of Sharon,
               and when you reflect it back to him his pleasure is heightened because it is
               unasked for. Remember: The wordless communication, the indirect com~
               pliment, contains the most power. No one can resist the enchantment of the
               Courtier’s Mirror.

               Yellow Kid Weil, con artist extraordinaire, used the Deceiver’s Mirror in
               his most brilliant cons. Most audacious of all was his recreation of a bank
               in Muncie, Indiana. When Weil read one day that the Merchants Bank in
               Muncie had moved, he saw an opportunity he could not pass up.
                     Well rented out the original Merchants building, which still contained
               bank furnitnure, complete with teller windows. He bought money bags,

358   LAW 44
stenciled a bank’s invented name on them, filled them with steel washers,
and arrayed them impressively behind the teller windows, along with bun-
dles of boodlevwreal bills hiding newspaper cut to size. For his banl<’s staff
and customers Weil hired gamblers, bookies, girls from local bawdy
houses, and other assorted confederates. He even had a local thug pose as a
bank dick.
     Claiming to be the broker for a certificate investment the bank was of-
fering, Weil would fish the waters and hook the proper wealthy sucker. He
would bring this man to the bank and ask to see the president. An “officer”
of the bank would tell them that they had to wait, which only heightened
the realism of the con-——one always has to wait to see the bank president.
And as they waited the bank would bustle with banklike activity, as call

girls and bookies in disguise floated in and out, making deposits and with»
drawals and tipping their hats to the phony bank dick. Lulled by this per~
feet copy of reality, the sucker would deposit $50,000 into the fake bank
without a worry in the world.
   Over the years Weil did the same thing with at deserted yacht club, an

Interpretation
The mirroring of reality offers immense deceptive powers. The right uni»
form, the perfect accent, the proper props——the deception cannot be deci~
phered because it is enmeshed in a simulation of reality. People have an
intense desire and need to believe, and their first instinct is to trust a. well»
constructed facade, to mistake it for reality. After all, we cannot go around
doubting the reality of everything we seewthat would be too exhausting.
We habitually accept appearances, and this is a credulity you can use.
    In this particular game it is the first moment that counts the most. If

your suckers’ suspicions are not raised by their first glance at the mirror’s
reflection, they will stay suppressed. Once they enter your hall of mirrors,
they will be unable to distinguish the real from the fake, and it will become
easier and easier to deceive them. Remember: Study the world’s surfaces
and learn to mirror them in your habits, your manner, your clothes. Like a
carnivorous plant, to unsuspecting insects you will look like all the other

plants in the field.

               such a situation without fully understanding it, while those around you un-

                   In 1864 the composer Richard Wagner moved to Munich at the behest
               of Ludwig 11, known variously as the Swan King or the Mad King of
               Bavaria. Ludwig was Wagner‘s biggest fan and most generous patron. The
               strength of his support turned Wagner’s head»-<mce established in Munich
               under the king's protection, he would be able to say and do whatever he
               wanted.
                   Wagner moved into a lavish house, which the king eventually bought
               for him. This house was but a stone’s throw from the former home of Lola
               Montez, the notorious courtesan who had plunged Ludwig II’s grandfather
               into a crisis that had forced him to abclicate. Warned that he could be in-
               fected by this association, Wagner only scoffed-——-“I am no Lola Montez,"
               he said. Soon enough, however, the citizens of Munich began to resent the
               favors and money showered on Wagner, and dubbed him “the second
               Lola,” or “Lolotte.” He unconsciously began to tread in Lo1a’s footsteps-
               spending money extravagantly, meddling in matters beyond music, even
               dabbling in politics and advising the king on cabinet appointments. Mean-
               while Ludwigs affection for Wagner seemed intense and undignified for a
               l-:ing——just like his grandfather’s love for Lola Montez.

      Eventually Ludwig’s ministers wrote him a letter: “Your Majesty now
stands at a fateful parting of the ways: you have to choose between the love
and respect of your faithful people and the ‘friendship’ of Richard Wag-
ner.” In December of 1865, Ludwig politely asked his friend to leave and
never   return. Wagner had inadvertently   placed himself in Lola Montez’s
reflection. Once there, everything he did reminded the stolicl Bavariams of
that dread woman, and there was nothing he could do about it.
      Avoid such association-effects like the plague. In a mirrored situation

you have little or no control over the reflections and recollections that will
be connected to you, and any situation beyond your control is dangerous.
Even if the person or event has positive associations, you will suffer from
not being able to live up to them, since the past generally appears greater
than the present. If you ever notice people associating you with some past
event or person, do everything you can to separate yourself from that

memory and to shatter the reflection.

                                   he did not envision and could not control.
                                       The man who initiates strong reforms often becomes the scapegoat for
                                   any kind of dissatisfaction. And eventually the reaction to his reforms may

                                   and threat, we latch on to familiar faces and create habits and rituals to
                                   make the world more comfortable.        Change can be pleasant and even
                                   sometimes desirable in the abstract, but too much of it creates an anxiety
                                   that will stir and boil beneath the surface and then eventually erupt.
                                       Never underestimate the hidden conservatism of those around you. It
                                   is powerful and entrenched. Never let the seductive charm of an idea cloud

                                   your reason: just as you cannot make people see the world your way, you
                                   cannot wrench them into the future with painful changes. They will rebel.
                                   If reform is necessary, anticipate the reaction against it and find ways to

                                   disguise the change and sweeten the poison.

                                   As a young Communist in the 19203, Mao Tsetung understood better than

China. With their small numbers, limited funds, lack of military experi-
ence, and small arsenal of weapons, the Party had no hope of success un-
less it won   over   China’s immense peasant population. But who in the
world was more conservative, more rooted in tradition, than the Chinese
peasantry? The oldest civilization on the planet had a history that would
never loosen its
               power, no matter how violent the revolution. The ideas of
Confucius remained as alive in the 19203 as they had been in the sixth cen-
tury B.C., when the philosopher was alive, Despite the oppressions of the
current system, would the peasantry ever give up the deep~rooted values of
the past for the great unknown of Communism?
     The solution, as Mao saw it, involved a simple deception: Cloak the
revolution in the clothing of the past, making it comforting and legitimate
in people’s eyes. One of Mao’s favorite books was the very popular me
dieval Chinese novel 77:: Water Margin, which recounts the exploits of a
Chinese Robin Hood and his robber band as they struggle against a cor-
rupt and evil monarch. In China in Mao’s time, family ties dominated over
any other kind, for the Confucian hierarchy of father and oldest son re-
mained firmly in place; but The Witter Margin preached a superior value-
the fraternal ties of the band of robbers, the nobility of the cause that unites

people beyond blood. The novel had great emotional resonance for Chi~
nese
     people, who love to root for the underdog. Time and again, then,
Mao would present his revolutionary army as an extension of the robber
band in The I'V1terMargz'n, likening his struggle to the timeless conflict be-
tween the oppressed peasantry and an evil emperor. He made the past
seem to
        envelop and legitimize the Communist cause; the peasantry could
feel comfortable with and even support a group with such roots in the past.
     Even once the Party came to power, Mao continued to associate it with
the past. He presented himself to the masses not as a Chinese Lenin but as
a.   modem Chuko Liang, the real»life third-century strategist who figures

prominently in the popular historical novel The Romance of the Wtree King~
dams. Liang was more than a great general—he was a poet, a philosopher,
and a figure of stem moral rectitude. So Mao represented himself as a poet-
wanior like Liang, a man who mixed strategy with philosophy and

preached a new ethics. He made himself appear like a hero from the great
Chinese tradition of warrior statesmen.
     Soon, everything in Mao’s speeches and writings had a reference to an
earlier period in Chinese history. He recalled, for example, the great Em-
peror Ch’in, who had unified the country in the third century B.C. Ch’in
had burned the works of Confucius, consolidated and completed the build-
ing of the Great Wall, and given his name to China, Like Ch’in, Mao also
had brought the country together, and had sought bold reforms against an
oppressive past. Ch’in had traditionally been seen as a violent dictator
whose reign was short; the brilliance of Mao’s strategy was to turn this
around, simultaneously reinterpreting Ch’in, justifying his rule in the eyes
of present-day Chinese, and using him to justify the violence of the new
order that Mao himself was creating.
    After the failed Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s, a power struggle

                                                                                   LAW 45   395
                   emerged in the Communist Party in which Mao’s main foe was Lin Piao,
                   once a close   friend of his. To make clear to the masses the difference be-
                   tween his   philosophy and Lin’s, Mao once again exploited the past: He
                   cast   his opponent as representing Confucius, a. philosopher Lin in fact
                   would constantly quote. And Confucius signified the conservatism of the
                   past. Mao associated himself, on the other hand, with the ancient philo-
                   sophical movement known as Legalism, exemplified by the writings of
                   Han—fei~tzu. The Legalists disdained Confucian ethics; they believed in the
                   need for violence to create a new order. They worshiped power. To give
                   himself weight in the struggle, Mao unleashed a nationwide propaganda
                   campaign against Confucius, using the issues of Confucianism versus Le-
                   galism to whip the young into a kind of frenzied revolt against the older
                   generation. This grand context enveloped a. rather banal power struggle,
                   and Mao once again won over the masses and triumphed over his enemies.


                   Interpretation
                   No people had a more profound attachment to the past than the Chinese.
                   In the face of this enormous obstacle to reform, Mada strategy was simple:
                   Instead of struggling against the past he turned it to his advantage, associ~
                   ating his radical Communists with the romantic figures of Chinese history.
                   Weaving the story of the War of the Three Kingdoms into the struggle be-
                   tween the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, be cast himself as
                   Chuko Liang. As the emperors had, he welcomed the cultlike adoration of
                   the masses, understanding that the Chinese could not function without
                   some kind of father      figure to admire. And after he made a terrible blunder
                   with the Great Leap Forward, trying to force modernization on the country
                   and failing miserably, he never repeated his mistake: From then on, radical
                   change had to be cloaked in the comfortable clothes of the past.
                        The lesson is simple: The past is powerful. What has happened before
                   seems
                          greater; habit and history give any act weight. Use this to your ad-
                   vantage. When you destroy the fa.milia.r you create a void or vacuum; peo
                   ple fear the chaos that will flood in to fill it. You must avoid stirring up such
                   fears at all cost. Borrow the weight and legitimacy from the past, however
                   remote, to create a comforting and familiar presence. This will give your
                   actions romantic associations, add to your presence, and cloak the nature
                   of the changes you are attempting.


                           It must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry out,

                   KEYS TO POWER
                   Human psychology contains many dualities, one of them being that even
                   while people understand the need for change, knowing how important it is
                   for institutions and individuals to be occasionally renewed, they are also ir-

ritated and upset by changes that affect them personally. They know that

change is necessary, and that novelty provides relief from boredom, but
deep inside they cling to the past. Change in the abstract, or superficial
change, they desire, but a change that upsets core habits and routines is
deeply disturbing to them.
     No revolution has gone without a powerful later reaction against it, for
in the long run the void it creates proves too unsettling to the human ani-

mal, who unconsciously associates such voids with death and chaos. The
opportunity for change and renewal seduces people to the side of the revo~
lution, but once their enthusiasm fades, which it will, they are left with a
certain emptiness. Yearning for the past, they create an opening for it to

creep back in.
    For Machiavelli, the prophet who preaches and brings change can
only survive by taking up arms: When the masses inevitably yearn for the
past, he must be ready to use force. But the armed prophet. cannot last long
unless he quickly creates a new set of values and rituals to replace the old
ones, and to soothe the anxieties of those who dread change. It is far easier,
and less bloody, to play a kind of con game. Preach change as much as you
like, and even enact your reforms, but give them the comforting appear-
ance of   older events and traditions.
    Reigning from A.D. 8 to AD. 23, the Chinese emperor Wang Mung
emerged from a period of great historical turbulence in which the people
yearned for order, an order represented for them by Confucius. Some two
hundred years earlier, however, Emperor Ch’in had ordered the writings
of Confucius burned. A few years later, word had spread that certain texts
had miraculously survived, hidden under the scholar’s house. These texts

may not have been genuine, but they gave Wang his opportunity: He first
confiscated them, then had his scribes insert passages into them that
seemed to support the changes he had been imposing on the country.
When he released the texts, it seemed that Confucius sanctioned Wang’s
reforms, and the people felt comforted and accepted them more easily.
     Understand: The fact that the past is dead and buried gives you the
freedom to reinterpret it. To support your cause, tinker with the facts. The
past is a text in which you can safely insert your own lines.
     A simple gesture like using an old title, or keeping the same number
for a group, will tie you to the past and support you with the authority of

history. As Machiavelli himself observed, the Romans used this device
when they transformed their monarchy into a republic. They may have in
stalled two consuls in place of the king, but since the king had been served
by twelve lictors, they retained the same number to serve under the con-
suls. The king had personally performed an annual sacrifice, in 9. great

spectacle that stirred the public; the republic retained this practice, only
transferring it to a special “chief of the ceremony, whom they called the
King of the sacrifice.” These and similar gestures satisfied the people and
kept them from clamoring for the monarchy’s return.
     Another strategy to disguise change is to make a loud and public dis~
play of support for the values of the past. Seem to be a zealot for tradition
                                                                                 LAW 45   397
               and few will notice how unconventional you really are. Renaissance Flo-
               rence  had a centuries—old republic, and was suspicious of anyone who
               floated its traditions. Cosimo de’ Medici made a Show of enthusiastic sup
               port for the republic, while in reality he worked to bring the city under the
               control of his wealthy family. In form, the Medicis retained the appearance
               of a republic; in substance, they rendered it powerless. They quietly en~
               acted a radical change, while appearing to safeguard tradition.
                   Science claims a search for truth that would seem to protect it from
               conservatism and the irrationality of habit: It is a culture of innovation. Yet
               when Charles Darwin published his ideas of evolution, he faced fiercer ope

               position from his fellow scientists than from religious authorities. His theo-
               ries challenged too many fixed ideas. Jonas Salk ran into the same wall
               with his radical innovations in immunology, as did Max Planck with his

               revolutionizing of physics. Planck later wrote of the scientific opposition he
               faced, “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents
               and making them see the light. but rather because its opponents eventually
               die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”
                   The answer to this innate conservatism is to play the courtier’s game.
               Galileo did this at the beginning of his scientific career; he laxer became
               more   confrontational, and paid for it So pay lip service to tradition. Idem»
               tify the elements in your revolution that can be made to seem to build on
               the past. Say the right things, make a show of conformity, and meanwhile
               let your theories do their radical work. Play with appearances and respect
               past protocol. This is true in every arenae-science being no exception.
                   Finally, powerful people pay attention to the zeitgeist If their reform is
               too far ahead of its time, few will understand it, and it will stir up anxiety

               and be hopelessly misinterpreted. The changes you make must seem less
               innovative than they are. England did eventually become a Protestant na~

               tion, as Cromwell wished, but it took over a century of gradual evolution.
                    Watch the zeitgeist. If you work in a tumultuous time, there is power to
               be gained by preaching a return to the past, to comfort, tradition, and rit-
               ual. During a period of stagnation, on the other hand, play the card of re-
               form and revo1ution—but beware of what you stir up. Those who finish a
               revolution are rarely those who start it. You will not succeed at this danger-
               ous game unless
                               you are willing to forestall the inevitable reaction against it
               by playing with appearances and building on the past.




               Authority: He who desires or attempts to reform the government of a
               stale, and wishes to have it accepted, must at least retain the semblance of
               the old forms; so that it may seem to the people that there has been no
               change in the institutions, even though in fact they are entirely different
               from the old ones. For the great majority of mankind are satisfied with ap-

               pearances, as though they were realities. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)

REVERSAL
The past is a corpse to be used as you see fit. If what happened in the re-
cent past was   painful and harsh. it is se1f—destructive to associate yourself
with it. When Napoleon came to power, the French Revolution was fresh
in everyone’s minds. If the court that he established had borne any resem-
blance to the lavish court of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, his courtiers
would have spent all their time worrying about their own necks. Instead,
Napoleon established a court remarkable for its sobriety and lack of osten-
tation. It was the court of a man who valued work and military virtues. This
new form seemed     appropriate and reassuring.
    In other words, pay attention to the times. But understand: If you
make a bold change from the past, you must avoid at all costs the appear-
ance of a void or vacuum, or you will create terror. Even an   ugly recent his-
tory will seem preferable to an empty space. Fill that space immediately
with new rituals and forms. Soothing and growing familiar, these will secure
your position among the masses.
    Finally, the arts, fashion, and technology would seem to be areas in
which power would come from creating a radical rupture with the past and
appearing cutting edge. Indeed, such a strategy can bring great power, but
it has many dangers. It is inevitable that your innovations will be outdone

by someone else. You have little control—-someone younger and fresher
moves in a sudden new direction, making your bold innovation of yester~

day seem tiresome and tame today. You are forever playing catch-up; your
power is tenuous and short-lived. You want a power built on something
more solid. Using the past, tinkering with tradition, playing with conven-

tion to subvert it will give your creations something more than a momen-

tary appeal. Periods of dizzying change disguise the fact that a yearning for
the past will inevitably creep back in. In the end, using the past for your
own
      purposes will bring you more power than trying to cut it out com-
p1etely—-a. futile and self-destructive endeavor.

    The king was a man whom the slightest feeling of boredom would op-

under her spell meant keeping him amused. To that end she put on con-

Pompadour thwarted them in a totally novel way for a l-:ing’s mistress: with
extreme     politeness. Snobs who resented her for her low birth she won over
with charm and grace. Most unusual of all, she befriended the queen, and
insisted that Louis XV pay more attention to his wife, and treat her more
kindly. Even the royal family hegmdgingly gave her their support. To

recognizing the role of luck and circumstance in your success, and remain-

KEYS TO POWER
Power has its own rhythms and patterns. Those who succeed at the game
are the ones who control the patterns and vary them at will, keeping peo-

ple off balance while they set the tempo. The essence of strategy is control-
ling what comes next, and the elation of victory can upset your ability to
control what comes next in two ways. First, you owe your success to a pat»
tern that you are apt to try to
                               repeat. You will try to keep moving in the
same direction without
                       stopping to see whether this is still the direction that
is best for you. Second, success tends to go to your head and make you
emotional. Feeling invulnerable, you make aggressive moves that ulti-

mately undo the victory you have gained.
     The lesson is simple: The powerful vary their rhythms and patterns,
change course, adapt to circumstance, and learn to improvise. Rather than
letting their dancing feet impel them forward, they step back and look
where they are going. It is as if their bloodstream bore a kind of antidote to
the intoxication of victory, letting them control their emotions and come to
a kind of mental halt when
                              they have attained success. They steady them-
selves, give themselves the space to reflect on what has happened, examine
the role of circumstance and luck in their success. As they say in riding
school, you have to be able to control yourself before you can control the
horse.
    Luck and circumstance always play a. role in power. This is inevitable,
and actually makes the game more interesting. But despite what you may
think, good luck is more dangerous than had luck. Bad luck teaches valu~
able lessons about patience, timing, and the need to be prepared for the
worst; good luck deludes you into the opposite lesson, making you think
your brillliance will cany you through. Your fortune will inevitably turn,
and when it does you will be completely unprepared.

    According to Machiavelli, this is what undid Cesare Borgia. He had
many triumphs, was actually a clever strategist, but had the bad luck to
have good luck: He had a. pope for a father. Then, when he had bad luck

               fortune will hurtle you down as easily as up. If you prepare for the fall, it is
               less likely to ruin you when it happens.
                      People who have a run of success can catch a kind of fever, and even
               when they themselves try to stay calm, the people below them often pres—

                   When the Athenian general and statesman Pericles led a series of
               naval campaigns around the Black Sea in 436 u.(:., his easy triumphs en-
               flamed the Athenians’ desire for      more.
                                                             They dreamed of conquering
               Egypt, overrunning Persia, sailing for Sicily. On the one hand Pericles
               reined in these dangerous emotions by warning of the perils of hubris. On
               the other hand he fed them by fighting small battles that he knew he could
               win, creating the appearance that he was preserving the momentum of suc»
               cess.   The skill with which Pericles played this game is revealed by what
               happened when he died: The demagogues Cook over, pushed Athens into
               invading Sicily, and in one rash move destroyed an empire.
                   The rhythm of power often requires an alternation of force and cun-
               ning. Too much force creates a counterreaction; too much cunning, no
               matter how cunning it is, becomes     predictable. Working on behalf of his
               master, the shogun Oda Nobunaga, the great sixteenth-century japanese
               general (and future emperor) Hideyoshi once engineered a stunning vic-
               tory over the army of the formidable General Yoshimoto. The shogun
               wanted to go further, to take on and crush yet another powerful enemy, but
               Hideyoshi reminded him of the old Japanese saying: “When you have
               won a victory, tighten the strings of your helmet.” For Hideyoshi this was

               the moment for the shogun to switch from force to cunning and indirec-
               tion, setting his enemies against one another through a. series of deceptive
               alliances. In this way he would avoid stirring up needless opposition by

               appearing overly aggressive. When you are victorious, then, lie low, and
               lull the enemy into inaction. These changes of rhythm are immensely
               powerful.
                    People who go past the mark are often motivated by a desire to please
               a master
                         by proving their dedication. But an excess of effort exposes you to
               the risk of making the master suspicious of you. On several occasions, gen-
               erals under Philip of Macedon were disgraced and demoted immediately
               after leading their troops to a great victory; one more such victory, Philip
               thought, and the man might become a rival instead of an underling. When
               you serve a master, it is often wise to measure your victories carefully, let-
               ting him get the glory and never making him uneasy. It is also wise to es-
               tablish a pattern of strict obedience to earn his trust. In the fourth century
               B.C., a. captain under the notoriously severe Chinese general Wu Ch’i
               charged ahead before a battle had begun and came back with several

416   LAW 47
enemy heads. He thought he had shown his fiery enthusiasm, but Wu Ch’i
was
    unimpressed. “A talented officer,” the general said with a sigh as he or-
dered the man beheaded, “but a disobedient one.”
    Another moment when 3. small success can spoil the chances for a
larger one may come if a master or superior grants you a favor: It is a dan-
gerous mistake to ask for more. You will seem insecur%perhaps you feel
you did not deserve this favor, and have to grab as much as you can when
you have the chance, which may not come again. The proper response is
to accept the favor graciously and withdraw. Any subsequent favors you
should earn without having to ask for them.
    Finally, the moment when you stop has great dramatic import. What
comes last sticks in the mind as a kind of exclamation      point. There is no
better time to stop and walk away than after a victory. Keep going and you
risk lessening the effect, even ending up defeated. As lawyers say of cross-
examination, “Always stop with a victory.”

 Authority: Princes and republics should content themselves with victory,
 for when they aim at more, they generally lose. The use of insulting lan-
 guage toward an enemy arises from the insolence of victory, or from the
 false hope of victory, which latter misleads men as often in their actions
 as in   their words; for when this false hope takes possession of the mind,
 it makes men go beyond the mark, and causes them to sacrifice a. cer-
 tain good for an uncertain better.         {Niccolo Machiavelli, 14694527)

                                                                                          ‘

                As Machiavelli says, either destroy a man or leave him alone entirely. In-
                flicting half punishment or mild injury will only create an enemy whose
                bitterness will grow with time, and who will take revenge. When you beat
                an
                     enemy, then, make your victory complete. Crush him into nonexis
                tence. In the moment of victory, you do not restrain yourself from   crushing
                the enemy you have defeated, but rather from needlessly advancing
                against others. Be merciless with your enemy, but do not create new ene-
                mies by overreaching.
                     There are some who become more cautious than ever after a victory,
                which they see as just giving them more possessions to wony about and

                protect. Your caution after victory should never make you hesitate, or lose
                momentum, but rather act as a safeguard against rash action. On the other
                hand, momentum as a phenomenon is greatly overrated. You create your
                own successes, and if they follow one upon the other, it is your own doing.

                Belief in momentum will only make you emotional, less prone to act strate»

                gically, and more apt to repeat the same methods. Leave momentum for
                those who have nothing better to rely upon.

djctably, are infinitely more powerful and secure.
     In facing a serious problem~——controlling superior numbers—Sparta
reacted like an animal that develops a shell to protect itself from the envi-
ronment. But like a turtle, the Spartans sacrificed mobility for safety. They

managed to preserve stability for three hundred years, but at what cost?
They had no culture beyond warfare, no arts to relieve the tension, a con
stant anxiety about the status quo. While their neighbors took to the sea,

learning to adapt to a world of constant motion, the Spartans entombed
themselves in their own system. Victory would mean new lands to govern,
which they did not want; defeat would mean the end of their military ma
chine, which they did not want, either. Only stasis allowed them to survive.
But nothing in the world can remain stable forever, and the shell or system
you evolve for your protection will someday prove your undoing.
     In the case of Sparta, it was not the armies of Athens that defeated it,
but the Athenian money. Money flows everywhere it has the opportunity
to go; it cannot be controlled, or made to fit a prescribed pattern. It is in-

herently chaotic. And in the long run, money made Athens the conqueror,

      A game of go——called wet’-chi in China-can last up to three hundred
moves.    The strategy is more subtle and fluid than chess, developing slowly;
the more complex the pattern your stories initially create on the board, the
harder it is for your opponent to understand your strategy. Fighting to con-
trol a particular area is not worth the trouble: You have to think in larger
terms, to be prepared to sacrifice an area in order eventually to dominate
the board. What you are after is not an entrenched position but mobility.
With mobility you can isolate the opponent in small areas and then encir-
cle them. The aim is not to kill off the opponent’s pieces directly, as in
chess, but to induce a kind of paralysis and collapse. Chess is linear, posi-

                                     The human animal is         distinguished by its constant creation of forms.
                                     Rarely expressing its emotions directly, it gives them form through lan-
                                     guage, or through socially acceptable rituals. We cannot communicate our

with an abstract, hard—to—ant:icipate form. They are operating in a third di-
mension: the mind.
      Back on land, guerrilla warfare too demonstrates this evolution toward
abstraction. T. E. Lawrence was perhaps the first modern strategist to de-


                                                                                              LAW 48              425
velop the theory behind this kind of warfare, and to put it into practice. His
ideas influenced Mao, who found in his writings an uncanny Western
equivalent to wei-chi. Lawrence was working with Arabs fighting for their
territory against the Turks. His idea was to make the Arabs blend into the
vast desert, never providing a target, never collecting together in one place.
As the Turks scrambled to fight this vaporous army, they spread them-
selves thin, wasfing energy in moving from place to place. They had the su-

perior firepower but the Arabs kept the inifiative by playing cat and
mouse, giving the Turks nothing to hold on to, destroying their morale.
“Most wars were wars of contact.    .  Ours should be a war of detachment,”
                                        .   .




Lawrence wrote. “We were to contain the enemy by the silent threat of a
vast unknown desert, not   disclosing ourselves till we attacked.”
      This is the ultimate form of strategy. The war of engagement has he-
come    far too dangerous and costly; indirection and elusiveness yield far
better results at a much lower cost. The main cost, in fact, is mental-—the
thinking it takes to align your forces in scattered patiems, and to under-
mine the minds and psychology of your opponents. And nothing will infu-
riate and disoxient them more than formlessness. In a world where wars of
detachment are the order of the day, formlessness is crucial.
      The first psychological requirement of formlessness is to train yourself
to take nothing personally. Never show any defensiveness. When you act
defensive, you show your emotions, revealing a clear form. Your oppo-
nents will realize they have hit a nerve, an Achilles’ heel. And they will hit
it again and again. So train yourself to take nothing personally. Never let

anyone get your back up. Be like a slippery ball that cannot be held: Let no
one know what
                  gets to you, or where your weaknesses lie. Make your face
a   formless mask and you will infuriate and disorient your scheming col-
leagues and opponents.
      One man who used this technique was Baron James Rothschild. A
German Jew in Paris, in a culture decidedly unfriendly to foreigners, Roth-
schild never took any attack on him personally or showed he had been
hurt in any way. He furthermore adapted himself to the political climate,
whatever it wa.s«——-the stiffly formal Restoration monarchy of Louis XVIII,
the bourgeois reign of Louis-Philippe, the democratic revolution of 1848,
the upstart Louis-Napoleon crowned emperor in 1852. Rothschild ac-
cepted them one and all, and blended in. He could afford to appear hypo-
critical or opportunistic because he was valued for his money, not his
politics; his money was the currency of power. While he adapted and
thrived, outwardly never showing a form, all the other great families that
had begun the century immensely wealthy were mined in the period’s
complicated shifts and turns of fortune. Attaching themselves to the past,
they revealed their embrace of a form.
     Throughout history, the formless style of ruling has been most adeptly
practiced by the queen who reigns alone. A queen is in a radically diflerent
position from a. king; because she is a woman, her subjects and courtiers
are
    likely to doubt her ability to rule, her strength of character. If she favors
one   side in some ideological struggle, she is said to be acting out of emo-
tional attachment. Yet if she represses her emotions and plays the authori-
tarian, in the male fashion, she arouses worse criticism still. Either by
nature orby experience, then, queens tend to adopt a flexible style of gov-
erning that in the end often proves more powerful than the more direct,
male form.
      Two female leaders exemplifying the forxnless style of rule are Queen
Elizabeth of England and Empress Catherine the Great of Russia. In the vi-
olent wars between Catholics and Protestants, Elizabeth steered a middle
course.   She avoided alliances that would commit her to one side, and that
over time   would harm the country. She managed to keep her country at

peace until it was strong enough for war. Her reign was one of the most glo-
rious in history because of her incredible capacity to adapt and her flexible

ideology.
      Catherine the Great too evolved an improvisatory style of governing.
Afler she deposed her husband, Emperor Peter H, taking sole control of
Russia in 1762, no one thought she would survive. But she had no precon»
ceived ideas, no philosophy or theory to dictate her policies. Although a
foreigner (she came from Germany), she understood Russia’s moods, and
how it was changing over the years. “One must govern in such a way that
one’s people think they themselves want to do what one commands them
to do,” she said, and to do this she had to be always a step ahead of their
desires and to adapt to their resistance. By never forcing the issue, she re«
formed Russia in a strikingly short period of time.
     This feminine, fomiless style of ruling may have emerged as a way of
prospering under difficult circumstances, but it has proved immensely se-
ductive to those who have served under it. Being fluid, it is relatively easy
for its subjects to obey, for they feel less coerced, less bent to their mler’s

ideology. It also opens up options where an adherence to a doctrine closes
them off. Without committing to one side, it allows the ruler to play one
enemy off another. Rigid rulers may seem strong, but with time their in-
flexibility wears on the nerves, and their subjects find ways to push them
from the stage. Fle>u'ble, formless rulers will be much criticized, but they
will endure, and people will eventually come to identify with them, since
they are as their subjects are--changing with the wind, open to circum-
stance.

     Despite upsets and delays, the permeable style of power generally tri~
umphs in the end, just as Athens eventually won victory over Sparta
through its money and its culture. When you find yourself in conflict with
someone stronger and more rigid, allow them a momentary victory. Seem

to bow to their superiority. Then, by being formless and adaptable, slowly
insinuate yourself into their soul. This way you will catch them off guard,
for rigid people are always ready to ward of‘! direct blows but are helpless

against the subtle and insinuating. To succeed at such a strategy you must
play the cha.meleon—conform on the surface, while breaking down your
enemy from the inside.

                    For centuries the Japanese would accept foreigners graciously, and ap—

               peared susceptible to foreign cultures and influences. joao Rodriguez, a
               Portuguese priest who arrived in japan in 1577 and lived there for many
               years, wrote, “I am flabbergasted by the Japanese willingness to my and ac-
               cept everything Portuguese.” He saw japanese in the streets wearing Por—
               tuguese clothing, with rosary beads at their necks and crosses at their hips.
               This might seem like a weak, mutable culture, but ]apa.n’s adaptability

               actually protected the country from having an alien culture imposed by
               military invasion. It seduced the Portuguese and other Westerners into be-
               lieving the japanese were yielding to a superior culture when actually the
               foreign culture’s ways were merely a fashion to be donned and doffed.
               Under the surface, Japanese culture thrived. Had the Japanese been rigid
               about foreign influences and tried to fight them off, they might have suf-
               fered the injuries that the West inflicted on China. That is the power of
               i'ormlessness—~—it gives the aggressor nothing to react against, nothing to hit.
                   In evolution, largeness is often the first step toward extinction. What is
               immense and bloated has no mobility, but must constantly feed itself. The

               unintelligent are often seduced into believing that size connotes power, the
               bigger the better.
                   In 4-83 13.0., King Xerxes of Persia invaded Greece, believing he could
               conquer the country in one easy campaign. After all, he had the largest
               army ever assembled for one invasion-—the historian Herodotus estimated
               it at over more than five million. The Persians planned to build a bridge
               across   the l-Iellespont to overrun Greece from the land, while their equally
               immense navy would        pin the Greek ships in harbor, preventing their
               forces from escaping to sea. The plan seemed sure, yet as Xerxes prepared
               the invasion, his adviser Artabanus warned his master of grave misgivings:
               “The two mightiest powers in the world are against you,” he said. Xerxes

               laughed-—what powers could match his gigantic army? “I will tell you what
               they are,” answered Artabanus. “The land and the sea." There were no safe
               harbors large enough to receive Xerxes‘ fleet. And the more land the Per-
               sians conquered, and the longer their supply lines stretched, the more ru-
               inous the cost of feeding this immense army would prove.

                    Thinking his adviser a coward, Xerxes proceeded with the invasion.
               Yet as Artabanus predicted, bad weather at sea decimated the Persian fleet,
               which was too large to take shelter in any harbor. On land, meanwhile, the
               Persian army destroyed everything in its path, which only made it impossi—
               hie to feed, since the destruction included crops and stores of food. it was
               also an easy and slowqnoving target. The Greeks practiced all kinds of de

               ceptive maneuvers to disorient the Persians. Xerxes’ eventual defeat at the
               hands of the Greek allies was an immense disaster. The story is emblematic
               of all those who sacrifice mobility for size: The flexible and fleet of foot will
               almost always win, for they have more strategic options. The more gigantic
               the enemy, the easier it is to induce collapse.
                   The need for formlessness becomes greater the older we get, as we
               grow more likely to become set in our ways and assume too rigid a form.


428   LAW 48
We become predictable, always the First sign of decrepitude. And pre~

dictability makes us appear comical. Although ridicule and disdain might
seem mild forms of attack,
                            they are actually potent weapons, and will even~
tually erode  a foundation of
                                power. An enemy who does not respect you
will grow bold, and boldness makes even the smallest animal dangerous.
     The late-eighteenth-ceniniry court of France, as exemplified by Marie-
Antoinette, had become so hopelessly tied to a rigid formality that the
average Frenchman thought it a silly relic. This depreciation of 21 centuries-
old institution was the first sign of a terminal disease, for it represented a
symbolic loosening of the people’s lies to monarchy. As the situation wors-
ened, Marie-Antoinette and King Louis XVI grew only more rigid in their
adherence to the past—and quickened their path to the guillotine. King
Charles I of England reacted similarly to the tide of democratic change
brewing in England in the 1630s: He disbanded Parliament, and his court
rituals grew increasingly formal and distant. He wanted to return to an
older style of ruling, with adherence to all kinds of petty protocol. His
rigidity only heightened the desire for change. Soon, of course, he was
swept up in a devastating civil war, and eventually he lost his head to the
executioner’s axe.
     As you get older, you must rely even less on the past Be vigilant lest
the form your character has taken makes you seem a relic. It is not a matter
of mimicking the fashions of youtl1—that is equally worthy of laughter.
Rather your mind must constantly adapt to each circumstance, even the in-
evitable change that the time has come to move over and let those of
younger age prepare for their ascendancy. Rigidity will only make you
look uncannily like a cadaver.
      Never forget, though, that fonnlessuess is a strategic pose. It gives you
room    to create tactical surprises; as your enemies struggle to guess your
next move, they reveal their own strategy, putting them at a decided disad—

vantage. It keeps the initiative on your side, putting your enemies in the
position of never acting, constantly reacting. It foils their spying and intelli-
gence. Remember: Formlessness is a tool. Never confuse it with a go~with-
the~llow style, or with a religious resignation to the twists of fortune. You
use   formlessness, not because it creates inner harmony and peace, but be-
cause it will increase your
                              power.
     Finally, learning to adapt to each new circumstance means seeing
events through your own eyes, and often ignoring the advice that people

constantly peddle your way. It means that ultimately you must throw out
the laws that others preach, and the books they write to tell you what to do,
and the sage advice of the elder. “The laws that govern circumstances are
abolished by new circumstances,” Napoleon wrote, which means that it is
up to you to gauge each new situation. Rely too much on other people’s
ideas and you end up taking a form not of your own making. Too much re«
spect for other people’s wisdom will make you depreciate your own. Be
brutal with the past, especially your own, and have no respect for the
philosophies that are foisted on you from outside.

                                                                                    LAW 4 8   429
                      Im age: Mer cury. The winged messenger,
                            god of commerce, patron saint of thieves,
                          gamblers, and all those who deceive through
                            swiftness. The day Mercury was born he invented
                              the lyre; by that evening he had stolen the cattle of

                      Apollo. He would scour the world, assuming
                         whatever form he desired. Like the liquid metal
                                       named after him, he embodies the elusive,
                                  the ungraspable——the power of formlessness.




                Authority: Therefore the consummation of forming an army is to arrive
                at formlessness. Victory in war is not repetitious, but adapts its form

                endlessly..   .A military force has no constant formation, water has no
                                  .




                constant shape: The ability to gain victory
                                                             by changing and adapting ac
                cording  to the opponent   is called genius. (Sun-tzu, fourth century B.c.)


               REVERSAL
               Using space to disperse and create an abstract pattern should not mean for-
               saking the concentration of your power when it is valuable to you. Form~
               lessness makes your enemies hunt all over for you, scattering their own
               forces, mental as well as physical. When you finally engage them, though,
               hit them with a powerful, concentrated blow. That is how Mao succeeded
               against the Nationalists: He broke their forces into small, isolated units,
               which he then could easily overwhelm with a strong attack. The law of con—
               centration prevailed.
                    When you play with formlessness, keep on top of the process, and
               keep your longeterm strategy in mind. When you assume a form and go on
               the attack, use concentration, speed, and power. As Man said, “When we
               fight you, we make sure you can’t get away.”
