faculty member who will supervise the project, within the area most
closely related to the study’s academic content to review and approve
the study. Independent study exceeding 3.0 credits in total should
consider current policies restricting use of independent study as well
as the incremental value of additional independent study in light of past
independent studies. If the study does not align with any of the Jones
Graduate School of Business academic groups, the Academic Standards
Committee will perform the review and make the ﬁnal approval decision.

Independent study projects are for academic credit, not for hire. Students
may not earn credit for paid work.

Faculty Sponsorship
Independent study projects normally are sponsored only by full-time
Jones Graduate School of Business faculty; faculty typically sponsor
projects only in their area of expertise. Students wanting sponsorship
by a part-time faculty member must submit a project overview to the
Academic Standards Committee and obtain the committee’s approval
before the term in which the project is to begin.

Common Requirements
The goal of independent study projects is to advance or deepen a
student’s knowledge or competency in a business discipline or activity.

To facilitate these goals, independent study projects generally fall into
two broad categories:

1. directed reading and study resulting in a research paper, or
2. an experiential or hands-on project resulting in an outcome such as
   an empirical analysis with an executive summary of the “deliverable.”

While the content of individual independent study projects are at the
discretion of a student and the sponsoring faculty member, to ensure
relatively equal workloads per unit of independent study credit and some
common requirements across independent study projects, students and/
or sponsoring faculty should:

1. Prepare and submit to the Jones Graduate School of Business
   associate registrar an overview of the independent study project
   with number of project credits, anticipated ﬁnal results, and a broad
   timeline of anticipated project milestones.
2. Meet to discuss the project, after the initial agreement on the project
   scope, at least once every two to three weeks.
3. Prepare a ﬁnal paper (in the case of directed reading and research
   projects) or complete a concrete deliverable (for example, computer
   program, survey results, empirical analyses, etc.) together with

                                                                                              2024-2025 General Announcements PDF Generated 01/08/25
