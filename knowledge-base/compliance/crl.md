REV. 03/05/25
Specifications are subject to change without notice.
Users should verify actual device performance in their specific applications.
The products described herein and this document are subject to specific legal disclaimers as set forth on the last page of this document, and at www.bourns.com/docs/legal/disclaimer.pdf.
     Legal Disclaimer Notice
This legal disclaimer applies to purchasers and users of Bourns® products manufactured by or on behalf of Bourns, Inc. and its
affiliates (collectively, “Bourns”).

Unless otherwise expressly indicated in writing, Bourns® products and data sheets relating thereto are subject to change
without notice. Users should check for and obtain the latest relevant information and verify that such information is current and
complete before placing orders for Bourns® products.

The characteristics and parameters of a Bourns® product set forth in its data sheet are based on laboratory conditions, and
statements regarding the suitability of products for certain types of applications are based on Bourns’ knowledge of typical
requirements in generic applications. The characteristics and parameters of a Bourns® product in a user application may vary
from the data sheet characteristics and parameters due to (i) the combination of the Bourns® product with other components
in the user’s application, or (ii) the environment of the user application itself. The characteristics and parameters of a Bourns®
product also can and do vary in different applications and actual performance may vary over time. Users should always verify
the actual performance of the Bourns® product in their specific devices and applications, and make their own independent
judgments regarding the amount of additional test margin to design into their device or application to compensate for
differences between laboratory and real world conditions.

Unless Bourns has explicitly designated an individual Bourns® product as meeting the requirements of a particular industry
standard (e.g., IATF 16949) or a particular qualification (e.g., UL listed or recognized), Bourns is not responsible for any failure
of an individual Bourns® product to meet the requirements of such industry standard or particular qualification. Users of
Bourns® products are responsible for ensuring compliance with safety-related requirements and standards applicable to their
devices or applications.

Bourns® products are not recommended, authorized or intended for use in nuclear, lifesaving, life-critical or life-sustaining ap-
plications, nor in any other applications where failure or malfunction may result in personal injury, death, or severe property or
environmental damage. Unless expressly and specifically approved in writing by two authorized Bourns representatives on a
case-by-case basis, use of any Bourns® products in such unauthorized applications might not be safe and thus is at the user’s
sole risk. Life-critical applications include devices identified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as Class III devices and
generally equivalent classifications outside of the United States.

Bourns expressly identifies those Bourns® standard products that are suitable for use in automotive applications on such
products’ data sheets in the section entitled “Applications.” Unless expressly and specifically approved in writing by two
authorized Bourns representatives on a case-by-case basis, use of any other Bourns® standard products in an automotive
application might not be safe and thus is not recommended, authorized or intended and is at the user’s sole risk. If Bourns
expressly identifies a sub-category of automotive application in the data sheet for its standard products (such as infotainment
or lighting), such identification means that Bourns has reviewed its standard product and has determined that if such Bourns®
standard product is considered for potential use in automotive applications, it should only be used in such sub-category of
automotive applications. Any reference to Bourns® standard product in the data sheet as compliant with the AEC-Q standard
or “automotive grade” does not by itself mean that Bourns has approved such product for use in an automotive application.

Bourns® standard products are not tested to comply with United States Federal Aviation Administration standards generally
or any other generally equivalent governmental organization standard applicable to products designed or manufactured for
use in aircraft or space applications. Bourns expressly identifies Bourns® standard products that are suitable for use in aircraft
or space applications on such products’ data sheets in the section entitled “Applications.” Unless expressly and specifically
approved in writing by two authorized Bourns representatives on a case-by-case basis, use of any other Bourns® standard
product in an aircraft or space application might not be safe and thus is not recommended, authorized or intended and is at the
user’s sole risk.

The use and level of testing applicable to Bourns® custom products shall be negotiated on a case-by-case basis by Bourns and
the user for which such Bourns® custom products are specially designed. Absent a written agreement between Bourns and the
user regarding the use and level of such testing, the above provisions applicable to Bourns® standard products shall also apply
to such Bourns® custom products.

Users shall not sell, transfer, export or re-export any Bourns® products or technology for use in activities which involve the
design, development, production, use or stockpiling of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or missiles, nor shall they use
Bourns® products or technology in any facility which engages in activities relating to such devices. The foregoing restrictions
apply to all uses and applications that violate national or international prohibitions, including embargos or international
regulations. Further, Bourns® products and Bourns technology and technical data may not under any circumstance be
exported or re-exported to countries subject to international sanctions or embargoes. Bourns® products may not, without prior
authorization from Bourns and/or the U.S. Government, be resold, transferred, or re-exported to any party not eligible
to receive U.S. commodities, software, and technical data.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Bourns disclaims (i) any and all liability for special, punitive, consequential,
incidental or indirect damages or lost revenues or lost profits, and (ii) any and all implied warranties, including implied warranties
of fitness for particular purpose, non-infringement and merchantability.
