    2017-18 AASA SUPERINTENDENT SALARY & BENEFITS
                         STUDY

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2017-18 AASA Superintendent Salary & Benefits Study marks the sixth edition of
this study, employing a revised survey instrument. This survey tracks the
demographics, salary, benefits, and other elements of the employment contracts of
school superintendents throughout the country. This year’s study is based on 1,172
responses (approximately a 14 percent response rate). The survey was distributed
online and relied on superintendents responding to 50 items with the understanding
that the report of findings would contain no personally identifiable information.
Consequently, data must be considered descriptive and not necessarily representative
of all superintendents. However, the report is rich with information and serves as a
useful snapshot of the salary and benefits of superintendents for the 2017-18 school
year. For a more detailed examination of the superintendency, The Study of the American
Superintendent: 2015 Mid-Decade Update and its 2010 predecessor are available on the
AASA website:
http://www.aasa.org/pages/templates/gsesearch.aspx?q=The%20study%20of%20the
%20American%20Superintendent
In addition, state-specific model superintendent employment agreements are also
available on the AASA website:
http://my.aasa.org/AASA/Toolbox/Other_Resources/Model_Contracts.aspx

This year, as in the past five years, more than 90 percent of respondents reported that
they served in suburban and rural districts with 70 percent of respondents self-reported
serving in rural districts. This is generally representative of the distribution of school
districts nationwide.

Consistent with findings of the previous years, male respondents outnumbered females
by slightly less than a four-to-one ratio. Respondents are also overwhelmingly white
(not Hispanic). Female respondents also tended to be somewhat older than their male
counterparts. The average and median age of all respondents is 52.

The median base salary distributed by district enrollment ranged from $96,750/$94,000
(male/female) for the smallest districts to $260,000/$259,892 (male/female) for
superintendents serving in the largest enrollment school districts. All positions, from
superintendent to teacher, show that salaries increase relative to district enrollment size
as well as slight increases over previous years.

INTRODUCTION

The 2017-18 AASA Superintendents Salary and Benefits Study is intended to provide
superintendents with actionable information needed to manage and negotiate their
compensation and benefits. This edition marks the sixth year the association has
undertaken a comprehensive study on public school superintendent compensation
benefits, employing a revised survey instrument. Prior to that, most school
superintendents relied on the annual salary study sponsored by Education Research
Service (ERS) to benchmark their compensation and benefits. With the closure of ERS, a
void was created. AASA responded to this need by developing a comprehensive study
of the salary and benefits of school superintendents that far exceeded previous studies
undertaken on this topic. AASA is particularly well-suited for this task because it
represents the vast majority of school superintendents in the country and has been most
active in collecting and disseminating to its members critical data needed to inform
decision making. AASA is committed to refining this work over time, thus maximizing
the benefit to superintendents.

The earlier editions of this study are available on the AASA website and provide
valuable retrospective data (http://www.aasa.org/research.aspx).

This work complements The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study
(Kowalski et al. 2010), also sponsored by AASA, and available from Roman & Littlefield
(https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781607099963). This study was updated in 2015 and is
available on the AASA website (http://www.aasa.org/research.aspx).

The research team authoring this report of findings was led by Leslie A. Finnan, AASA
senior legislative analyst, with the assistance Robert S. McCord, AASA research
consultant. The research was conducted under the direct supervision of Noelle Ellerson
Ng, AASA Associate Executive Director, Policy and Advocacy.

METHODOLOGY
An extensive survey instrument was developed in 2012 with the assistance of Professors
Theodore J. Kowalski (University of Dayton), I. Phillip Young (University of South
Carolina), Terry Orr (Bank Street College), and Christopher C. Stream (University of
Nevada, Las Vegas). This survey instrument was further refined for use in each
subsequent year as a result of input received. Using a commercially prepared mailing
list of American public school superintendents, more than 9,000 email invitations to
participate were distributed during the month of September 2017. At the same time,
state association executive directors were contacted to encourage their members to
respond to the online survey. Superintendents had the capacity to forward the link to
their staff members for input in completing the survey in their area of expertise.



                                                                                   Page | 3
REPORT OF FINDINGS
This report of findings is divided into 11 sections and relies solely on measures of
central tendency for this analysis of the data collected. These data are generally
disaggregated by gender, district enrollment, and racial/ethnic group.

As with any ambitious effort of this sort, there are limitations on the proper use of the
data. For example, when the responses for certain items are disaggregated by
racial/ethnic group, the number of responses is insufficient to support decision making.
Care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences on this particular data
element. In addition, some survey fatigue is commonly reported by superintendents
and could have impacted the return rate. Superintendents are inundated with research
requests resulting in selective participation in those studies seen as most important to
the role of the superintendent or of benefit to their district. After each data display, the
report authors have offered a general statement of findings. It is the intent of the
authors to allow the readers the opportunity to disaggregate the data in a manner they
find useful in working with their board.

Having clearly identified the limitations inherent in any endeavor of this sort, the report
that follows is replete with important information that can prove very useful to
superintendents.

END NOTES:
Many additional data elements were collected beyond those reported in this document.
AASA members interested in investigating in greater depth a particular element of this
study beyond those reported herein or are interested in offering suggestions for
improvement of this research undertaking are invited to directly contact Leslie Finnan
at the American Association of School Administrators (AASA).

Those citing the data presented herein and/or findings are asked to include acclamation
of AASA. Requests to use the data from this study or those that preceded it should

Findings:
   • A total of 1,172 usable responses were received, representing an approximately 14
      percent return rate. This return represents a substantial increase from that received in
      2015-16 response (N=728) while somewhat of a reduction from the responses (N=1,392)
      received in 2016. Despite the swings in response rates, demographics of the respondents
      have changed very little over the years.
   • All states except Hawaii (with a single superintendent) and Delaware are represented.

Findings:
   • Similar to previous studies, male respondents outnumbered females by slightly less
      than a four-to-one ratio. Over the past five editions of this study, we have seen a slow
      but consistent growth in female superintendents responding, suggesting an increase in
      females in the superintendency.
   • Respondents are overwhelmingly white (not Hispanic) accounting for 93.3 percent of
      the respondents.
   • The small number of minority superintendent respondents make definitive findings for
      those groups difficult.

Finding:
   • Consistent with nationwide school district enrollment data, the majority of
      superintendents are from intermediate size districts (300-2,499 students) with no recent
      appreciable change in the profile by gender of superintendents serving in each
      enrollment band.

Finding:
   • When asked to describe the setting of their district, approximately 70 percent of the
      respondents, regardless of gender, indicated that their district is best described as rural
      while about a quarter describe their district as suburban. This is very closely aligned
      with data from the National Center on Education Statistics, which shows that 5.7
      percent of districts are urban, 22.9 percent are suburban, and 71.5 percent are town or
      rural.

Finding:
   • Consistent with earlier versions of the study, the mean and median age for female
      superintendents is greater than their male counterparts. This supports the findings of
      other AASA studies on the superintendency where females tend to enter the role later
      and have greater experience in teaching and other education positions.

Findings:
  • In 2013, 49.6 percent of the respondents described their districts as economically stable
      while 43.1 percent of respondents described their districts as in declining economic
      condition. Since then, district economic conditions have improved steadily, albeit not
      dramatically.
  • Female superintendents are consistently less optimistic about the economic stability of
      their district. This trend has been consistent in recent years.

Finding:
  • As in the previously reported, white (not Hispanic) superintendents represent the vast
      majority of superintendents responding to the study regardless of district size, which is
      consistent with the findings of The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study
      as well as findings from the 2013-2017 salary studies. Note: As indicated in the
      introduction, care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences from the
      very small numbers of respondents in some of the racial/cultural groups, other than
      the fact that white (not Hispanic) superintendents are the largest group represented in
      the study and minorities appear to be underrepresented in the superintendent ranks,
      especially when compared to the racial/cultural profile of American public school
      enrollment.

Finding:
  • Considering the small representation of some racial/cultural group respondents, it is
      difficult to draw conclusions from these data, although the absence of diversity in urban
      districts represents an anomaly when one considers the diversity of the student
      population generally understood to be enrolled in urban districts.

Finding:
   • When the number of respondents is considered, not a great variation is found between
      the mean or median age of those responding when disaggregated by racial/cultural
      group. This is consistent with previous editions of this study.

Findings:
   • As reported in Table 1.6, half of superintendents have served in their present position
      from 1-5 years. A quarter of superintendents have served from 6-10 years.
   • The number of racial/cultural group respondents is too small to identify any trends.

Finding:
   • While the numbers are too small for most racial/cultural groups to draw definitive
       conclusions, there is some evidence that minority superintendents have served longer
       in the superintendency than white (not Hispanic) superintendents.

Finding:
    • When superintendents self-reported the economic condition of their district, about half
       indicated that their district is in stable condition regardless of the racial/cultural
       identity of the superintendent. Still, one third of districts are in declining economic
       condition. Again, care should be taken with over interpreting the data due to the
       limited number of minority superintendents responding to the survey.




                                                                                                 Page | 19
                                        SECTION #2: SALARY

 NOTE: A significant amount of information follows concerning salaries paid to the
 superintendents and their staff. For the purposes of comparisons, ratios have been calculated
 for median superintendent salaries and that of teachers (see Table 2.3). The logic employed is
 that in the private sector, a commonly used metric (ratio) is calculated based on the base salary
 of the CEO and that of the entry-level worker in the organization. Without great difficulty,
 other metrics can be calculated using these data presented herein.

Findings:
   • As previously reported, the limited response rate by gender in the largest student
       enrollment districts makes it difficult to identify trends in these districts; the salaries of
       male and female superintendents in similar sized districts do not differ significantly.
   • Consistent with previous years, salaries increase as district enrollment increases.

Findings:
   • Consistent with findings in previous editions of the study, the larger the student
      enrollment of the district the higher the mean base salary for assistant/associate
      superintendents. It is noted that in the smallest of districts, these positions often do not
      exist.
   • A modest but consistent increase in median salaries is seen over previous editions of
      this study, while the maximum salaries in some of the small enrollment districts appear
      to be inflated.

Finding:
   • As the district student enrollment grows so do the mean base salaries of high school
      principals, although the maximum salaries in some of the small enrollment districts
      appear to be inflated.

   Finding:

      generally increase as district enrollment increases, while the maximum salaries in some
      of the small enrollment districts appear to be inflated.

Finding:
   • Elementary school principals generally follow the same trend as their high school and
      middle school counterparts, although for the first time their 2017 median base salary in
      the largest districts has finally crossed the $100,000 line. The maximum salaries in some
      of the small and intermediate enrollment districts appears to be inflated.

Finding:
   • As mentioned above, a metric of growing importance in the private sector is the ratio
      of the entry level worker compensation with the base salary (without incentives) of the
      CEO. Accordingly, the median entry-level salary of teachers is presented compared
      with the median salary of the superintendents arrayed by district size. The data
      confirms that as the district enrollment increases so does the ratio. In addition, the ratio
      has appeared to generally widen over the past four survey periods regardless of the
      district enrollment.

Finding:
   • As in previous surveys, there is little difference in the term of the present contract when
      considered by gender. Contract terms of three years or less dominate. Note that state
      statutory law governs the term of contracts for school superintendents in some states.

Finding:
   • Only about 1 in 10 superintendents have an incentive provision in their contract. The
      year-over-year comparison shows a trend of small decreases in the use of this provision
      in contracts for superintendents.

Finding:
   • Longevity clauses are even less common than severance clauses, with fewer than 1 in
      10 males and even fewer female superintendents including this provision in their

Finding:

Finding:
   • Where sufficient numbers of respondent superintendents exist, viewed by

       than one in three contracts. This has changed only slightly both up and down over the
       years.

Finding:
   • Slightly more than half of boards used legal counsel in the development and/or
      negotiation of contracts. While lower than last year’s findings, this shows an increase
      from the first iteration of this study.

Finding:
   • While half of boards use legal counsel to assist in negotiating the superintendent’s
      employment agreement, only one in four superintendents seeks legal assistance
      concerning the negotiations of their employment agreement. The disparity is best
      described as striking.

   *Multiple answers per participant possible. Percentages added may exceed 100 since a participant may

Finding:
   • Overwhelmingly, districts support professional memberships for the superintendent.
