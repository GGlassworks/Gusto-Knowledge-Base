TIP: Consider using the estimator at www.irs.gov/W4App to determine the most accurate withholding for the rest of the year if: you
are completing this form after the beginning of the year; expect to work only part of the year; or have changes during the year in your
marital status, number of jobs for you (and/or your spouse if married filing jointly), dependents, other income (not from jobs),
deductions, or credits. Have your most recent pay stub(s) from this year available when using the estimator. At the beginning of next
year, use the estimator again to recheck your withholding.
Complete Steps 2–4 ONLY if they apply to you; otherwise, skip to Step 5. See page 2 for more information on each step, who can
claim exemption from withholding, and when to use the estimator at www.irs.gov/W4App.

Step 2:                      Complete this step if you (1) hold more than one job at a time, or (2) are married filing jointly and your spouse

or Spouse                    Do only one of the following.
Works                        (a) Use the estimator at www.irs.gov/W4App for the most accurate withholding for this step (and Steps 3–4). If
                                 you or your spouse have self-employment income, use this option; or
                             (b) Use the Multiple Jobs Worksheet on page 3 and enter the result in Step 4(c) below; or
                             (c) If there are only two jobs total, you may check this box. Do the same on Form W-4 for the other job. This
                                 option is generally more accurate than (b) if pay at the lower paying job is more than half of the pay at the
                                 higher paying job. Otherwise, (b) is more accurate . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Complete Steps 3–4(b) on Form W-4 for only ONE of these jobs. Leave those steps blank for the other jobs. (Your withholding will
be most accurate if you complete Steps 3–4(b) on the Form W-4 for the highest paying job.)

Step 3:                      If your total income will be $200,000 or less ($400,000 or less if married filing jointly):
