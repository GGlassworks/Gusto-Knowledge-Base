Location of Air Seal: The air seal between the test specimen and the test wall is detailed
below. The seal is made of foam weatherstripping and is attached to the edge of the test
specimen buck. The test specimen buck is placed against the test wall and clamped in place,
compressing the weatherstripping and creating a seal.
