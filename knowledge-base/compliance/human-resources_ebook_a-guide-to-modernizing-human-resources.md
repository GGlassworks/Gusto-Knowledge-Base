A guide to modernizing
human resources
Hyland’s HR solutions provide remote teams
a complete view of information and processes
    Whether Human Resources departments are
    managing employee information from a single
    office or from locations around the world, they
    can’t work efficiently or securely with paper
    documents. That’s where Hyland’s Human
    Resources solutions come in. Use this workbook
    to evaluate your current operations and find out
    how your HR team can operate from anywhere
    — while improving employee experience,
    compliance and accuracy.

Centralize
Hyland’s solutions deliver a full range of enterprise-class,
secure document management capabilities on a single platform.
HR teams can capture, organize and track employee information —
even sensitive data — regardless of format. Consolidate scattered
data, tasks and activities living outside your core HR systems,
and eliminate disorganized, risky paper processes.

Where is your employee data located?

     HRIS                                File shares

     HCM system                          Cloud storage

     SharePoint®                         Legacy systems

     ERP                                 Email inboxes

     Personal drives


With the Hyland Cloud, remote HR teams can securely manage
critical employee information — from anywhere.


Where is your HR department located?

     In one office                       Working remotely

     In several branches                 Hybrid — in office
                                         and remote

Integrate
Seamless system integrations allow HR staff to view personnel documents and content — like direct deposit forms, W-4s, leave
requests, employment contracts and correspondence — right alongside supporting employee data in the core HR application.
Content integrates with ERPs, HRIS, HCM and other HR systems, without requiring custom code, extending the life of existing
technology investments.




Does your HR team struggle with lack of integration between systems?


                   Switching applications:

                   HR staff frequently leave their HRIS and other related systems to perform related tasks, then switch back
                   to their core application. These related tasks could include searching for related information, performing
                   steps in a workflow, filling in forms and/or saving documents to email or edit.




                   Multi-step uploads:

                   Users perform multiple steps when simply trying to upload documents to core applications. They save
                   documents to a folder, launch systems, drag and drop a folder and then index the document.




                   Duplicate data entry:

                   Users enter the same data into multiple systems or transpose data from one system to another.




                   Data out of sync:

                   Data gets out of sync between applications, causing delays in your processes. Users must wait for
                   information to be updated, or manually verify and update information prior to acting.



Integrating Hyland solutions with your other core applications not only provides significant improvements in productivity,
but also reduces errors and improves data security and compliance.

Which level of integration could support your HR department?

    Pre-built connectors simplify integrating your Hyland solution with common productivity tools and
    enterprise applications.

    Integration servers ensure an instantaneous, reliable exchange of data between your Hyland
    platform and core systems without requiring programming to an API or relying on error-prone flat-
    file data exchanges.

    Web services provide an easily configurable way for your other applications
    to access data from your Hyland platform.

    Screen-level integration enables access to the relevant Hyland platform documents and operations
    directly from your other application windows.

    API integration gives you the flexibility to create your own integrations with the Hyland platform
    using industry-standard programming languages and protocols.

With more organizations operating remotely for the long-term, HR departments need secure employee
file management they can access from anywhere. The Hyland Cloud provides secure, scalable records
management, no matter where the records — or staff — are located. Get information to the right people
at the right time, minimizing process delays while giving users a complete view of each task, issue and
employee record.

 Hyland HR solutions integrate with virtually any business application, so users can access content and
interact with business processes directly from the familiar screens of critical HR applications.

organization who need access to documents?

needs to interact with your content.


Could HR staff benefit from extending content access beyond
