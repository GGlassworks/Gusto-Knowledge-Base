    Step 1.      Adjust the employee's payment amount
                 1a Enter the employee’s total taxable wages this payroll period . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1a                          $
                 1b Enter the number of pay periods you have per year (see Table 3) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1b

                1g If the box in Step 2 of Form W-4 is checked, enter -0-. If the box is not checked, enter $12,900 if the taxpayer
                     is married filing jointly or $8,600 otherwise . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .              1g   $

                1l Subtract line 1k from line 1c. If zero or less, enter -0-. This is the Adjusted Annual Wage Amount . . . . . . . 1l                                           $

    Step 2.      Figure the Tentative Withholding Amount
                 based on the employee's Adjusted Annual Wage Amount; filing status (Step 1(c) of the 2020 or later Form W-4) or marital status (line 3 of
                 Form W-4 from 2019 or earlier); and whether the box in Step 2 of 2020 or later Form W-4 is checked.
                 Note. Don't use the Head of Household table if the Form W-4 is from 2019 or earlier.

                 2a Enter the employee's Adjusted Annual Wage Amount from line 1i or 1l above . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                     2a   $
                 2b Find the row in the appropriate Annual Percentage Method table in which the amount on line 2a is at least the
                    amount in column A but less than the amount in column B, then enter here the amount from column A of that

    Step 3.      Account for tax credits
                 3a If the employee's Form W-4 is from 2020 or later, enter the amount from Step 3 of that form; otherwise,
                    enter -0- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3a     $

     Step 1. Adjust the employee’s wage amount
             1a Enter the employee's total taxable wages this payroll period . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                         1a $
               1b Enter the number of allowances claimed on the employee's most recent Form W-4 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                        1b
               1c Multiply line 1b by the amount in Table 7 for your pay frequency . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                         1c $
               1d Subtract line 1c from line 1a. If zero or less, enter -0-. This is the Adjusted Wage Amount . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                      1d $

     Step 2. Figure the Tentative Withholding Amount
             based on your pay frequency, the employee's Adjusted Wage Amount, and marital status (line 3 of Form W-4).

               2a Find the row in the Percentage Method table in this section in which the amount on line 1d is at least the amount
                  in column A but less than the amount in column B, and then enter here the amount from column A of that
                  row . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2a $
               2b Enter the amount from column C of that row . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2b $
               2c Enter the percentage from column D of that row . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2c                            %
               2d Subtract line 2a from line 1d . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        2d $
               2e Multiply the amount on line 2d by the percentage on line 2c . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                        2e $
               2f Add lines 2b and 2e. This is the Tentative Withholding Amount                                  .................................                               2f $

     Step 3. Figure the final amount to withhold
             3a Enter the additional amount to withhold from line 6 of the employee's Form W-4 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                     3a $
               3b Add lines 2f and 3a. This is the amount to withhold from the employee's wages this pay period                                                    ......        3b $
