     Calculation for collectibles gains or unrecaptured section 1250 gains. If a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust has
 collectibles gain or loss or unrecaptured section 1250 gain that is treated as API gain or loss, the pass-through entity must provide
 the API holder with information to determine whether collectibles gain or unrecaptured section 1250 gain is recharacterized under
 section 1061. The pass-through entity must provide the API holder with information that enables the API holder to separately
 determine its API 1-Year Distributive Share Amount and its API 3-Year Distributive Share Amount for its collectibles gain or loss
 and/or its unrecaptured section 1250 gain. This information should be attached to Worksheet A.
 (b)
     Capital interest gains and losses. See Regulations section 1.1061-3(c)(2) for computation of capital interest gains and losses.
 (c)
    Lookthrough Rule information. See Regulations section 1.1061-4(b)(9) for computation of Lookthrough Rule amount
 adjustment.
