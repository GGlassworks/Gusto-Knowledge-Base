INTRODUCTION

This edition of AASA, The School Superintendents Association’s “Superintendents
Salary and Benefits Study” marks the second year the association has undertaken a
national study on public school superintendents’ compensation. Until recently, most
school superintendents have had to rely on the annual salary study sponsored by
Education Research Service to benchmark their compensation and benefits. With the
closure of ERS, a void was created for such data. AASA responded to this need by
creating a comprehensive study of the salary and benefits of school superintendents
that far exceeded previous studies undertaken on this topic. AASA is particularly well-
suited for this task because it represents the vast majority of school superintendents in
the country and has been most active in collecting and disseminating to its members
critical data needed to inform decision making. AASA is committed to refining this
work over time, thus maximizing the benefit to superintendents. This work
complements The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study (Kowalski et al.
2010) also sponsored by AASA and available from Roman & Littlefield Publishers
(https://rowman.com).


METHODOLOGY

An extensive survey instrument was developed in 2012 with the assistance of Professors
Theodore J. Kowalski (University of Dayton), I. Phillip Young (University of South
Carolina), Terry Orr (Bank Street College) and Christopher C. Stream (University of
Nevada, Las Vegas). This survey instrument was further refined for use in 2013 (see
Section #11) as a result of input received from superintendents participating in the 2012
study. Using a commercially prepared mailing list of American public school
superintendents, more than 9,000 e-mail links were distributed during the month of
September 2013. At the same time, state association executive directors were contacted
to encourage their members to respond to the Internet survey. Superintendents had the
capacity to forward the link to their staff members for input in completing the survey in
their area of expertise. The response to the 2012 study numbered 1280 or about 14
percent, while the number of superintendents responding to the 2013 study nearly
doubled to 2,369 or more than 25 percent.


REPORT OF FINDINGS

This report of findings is divided into 11 sections and solely relies on measures of
central tendency for this initial analysis of the data collected. These data were generally
disaggregated by gender, district enrollment and racial/ethnic group. A significant


                                                                                              1
    body of data was collected with the central core of the data reported in this document.
    Additional analysis will follow.

    As with any ambitious effort of this sort, there are limitations on the proper use of the
    data that must be identified. Upon reflection and careful analysis, there are two
    limitations that should be taken into account when using these data. First, sufficient
    data was collected to guide superintendents in the development of their compensation
    packages save one important factor – in some cases, even with the near doubling of the
    response rate, the disaggregation by racial/ethnic group did not have a sufficient
    number of responses to support decision-making based on this category. Care should
    be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences on this particular data element.
    Second, survey fatigue is apparent among superintendents and impacted the return
    rate. Superintendents are inundated with research requests resulting in selective
    participation in those studies seen as most important to the role of the superintendent
    or of benefit to their district. The dramatic growth in the 2013 response rate over that
    received in 2012 is an indication of the importance superintendents place on collecting
    these data, while the participation rate of just over a quarter of all superintendents is
    less than is desired and reasonably raises questions of whether the data fairly represents
    the entire population.

    Having clearly identified the limitations inherent in any endeavor of this sort, the report
    that follows is rich with information that can prove useful to superintendents.


    SOME NOTEWORTHY FINDINGS

    For the purpose of bringing attention to some of the noteworthy findings, a few of those
    have been repeated below. Readers may also find particular interest in Section 10,
    which displays verbatim text of the unique contract provisions reported by responding
    superintendents. During the first year of this study, there has been great interest
    expressed in these redacted (to shield the identity of any respondent) contract
    provisions. Given that high level of interest, the responses from the 2012 study have
    been reprinted here along with the newly collected 2013 responses.

    A total of 2,369 usable responses were received for the 2013 study, or slightly over 25
     percent of those contacted, which represents near double the responses received for
     the 2012 study, indicating greater interest on the part of superintendents in these data.
    Similar to the 2012 study, respondents arrayed by gender favor males over females in
     a slightly more than three to one ratio which is consistent to the respondents in The
     American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study.
    Whites (not Hispanic) dominate the respondent ranks regardless of the gender.
    Central to the study of salary and benefits is understanding the respondents’
     perception of the economic condition of their district. Regardless of gender, nearly

                                                                                              2
    half of the superintendents described their district as stable while more than four in 10
    described their district as in declining economic condition.
   For those describing their district in declining economic condition, females
    outnumbered the males.
   When investigating the racial/cultural group and the respondents’ description of the
    economic condition of their district, a greater percentage of minority superintendents
    found themselves in districts of declining economic condition than white
    superintendents.
   As expected, 2012-13 median salary increases with district enrollment. This growth
    more than doubles when the median salary for the smallest district is compared to the
    largest enrollment district.
   In most, but not all cases, across district enrollments, median salaries paid to females
    are slightly higher than those paid to male superintendents. In drawing conclusions
    from these data, one must take into consideration the relatively small count of
    respondents in the smallest and largest districts.
   As in 2012-13 median salaries overall, females were generally still compensated at a
    higher rate than males when arrayed by district size.
   Increases in median base salaries generally increased by 1-2 percent from the 2012-13
    to 2013-14 school year.
   Constructing the metric ratios of median superintendent salary and median beginning
    teacher salary produced no appreciable change in recent years.
   Comparison of responses from the present study to the 2012-13 study indicate that
    nearly 10 percent more superintendents are now subject to an annual evaluation (85.1
    to 94.3).
   Even with the growth in annual evaluations, only half of the respondent
    superintendents indicate that they have included the process, measures and indicators
    to be used in the formal evaluation in their employment agreement.
   Slightly more than four in 10 superintendents indicated that student
    outcomes/performance data are included in their evaluations. No trend data on this
    matter is yet available.
   Slightly more than one in 10 superintendents who responded indicated they have
    been rehired as a superintendent after retiring from that state's or another state's
    retirement system. This is a marker of both an aging superintendent population and
    potentially narrowing pool of individuals interested in entering the superintendency.
   Slightly more than half of the respondent superintendents indicated that the district
    used a legal counsel to negotiate the superintendent’s employment agreement.
   In contrast to the use of legal counsel by the district, only about a quarter of
    respondent superintendents use the services of legal counsel themselves to negotiate
    their employment agreement.

      percent of those contacted, which represents near double the responses received for
      the 2012 study, indicating greater interest on the part of superintendents in these data.
    No state appears to be overrepresented.

      described their district as in declining economic condition.
    For those describing their district in declining economic condition, females
      outnumbered the males.

Finding:
    Further investigating the demography of the respondents, it was found that white
      (not Hispanic) superintendents dominated those responding to the survey which is
      consistent with the findings of The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial
      Study. This represents a less than 0.5 percent reduction from the 2012 study findings.
    Note: As indicated in the introduction, care should be exercised in drawing
      conclusions or inferences from the very small numbers of respondents in some of the
      racial/cultural groups other than the fact that white superintendents clearly dominate
      the respondent profile and minorities appear to be underrepresented in the
      superintendent ranks and in comparison to the racial/cultural profile of American
      public school enrollment.

Finding:
    Again as was true in the racial/cultural group reporting by enrollment, when asked
      how they characterize their district, black or African American respondents trended
      toward employment in larger districts in greater percentage than white respondents
      while the remaining racial/cultural group respondents were in such small numbers,
      making drawing any conclusions from the data tenuous at best.

Finding:
    When investigating the racial/cultural group and the respondents’ description of the
      economic condition of their district, a greater percentage of minority superintendents
      found themselves in districts of declining economic condition than white
      superintendents.

                                     SECTION #2: SALARY

NOTE: A significant amount of information follows concerning salaries paid to the
superintendents and their staff. For the purposes of comparisons, ratios have been calculated
for median superintendent salaries and that of teachers (See Table 2.5). The logic employed is
that in the private sector, a commonly used metric (ratio) is calculated based on the salary of
the CEO and that of the entry-level worker in the organization. Without great difficulty,
other metrics can be calculated using these data presented herein.

          * Note: No 2012-13 enrollment data collected.

Finding:
    As expected, 2012-13 median salary increases with district enrollment. This growth
      more than doubles when the median salary for the smallest district is compared to the
      largest enrollment district.
    In most, but not all cases, across district enrollments, median salaries paid to females
      is slightly higher than that paid to male superintendents. In drawing conclusions from
      these data, one must take into consideration the relatively small count of respondents
      in the smallest and largest districts.

Finding:
    With superintendents retiring earlier, the issue of post-retirement insurance coverage
      becomes an important matter. In the 2012-13 study, 17.6 percent of the respondents
      reported having post-retirement health coverage in their employment agreement. This
      year 28.1 percent reported having that benefit.

Finding:
    Slightly more than one in 10 superintendents who responded indicated that they have
      been rehired as a superintendent after retiring from that state's or another state's
      retirement system. This is a marker of both an aging superintendent population and
      potentially narrowing pool of individuals interested in entering the superintendency.

Finding:
   Very few superintendents are drawing retirement from one state while serving as a
      superintendent in another state. As some states have employed caps on salaries (see
      Table 7.13), this might change. It is the intent of AASA to use this data as a baseline
      and to collect similar data over several years to document any potential trends.

Finding:
    Compared to limited inclusion of a severance clause, longevity clauses are even less
      common, with somewhat more than one in 20 including such a provision.
