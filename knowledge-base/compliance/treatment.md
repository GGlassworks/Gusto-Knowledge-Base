INTRODUCTION


S
         tudents in a high school psychology course are, for the most part, fasci-
         nated by the abnormal psychology units, both the descriptions of the
         disorders, as well as the treatment options presented in the units. It
is always wise to stress that we are all students of the science of psychology,
not psychologists! As case studies are presented in class, be sure to stress
that clinicians do not diagnose clients on the basis of a brief description; that
case studies are used in class to have an overview of a wide variety of disor-
ders. It is also important to alert students to the impact of labeling people as
having a psychological disorder — stigmas are real and hurtful. For this reason,
it is harmful to ever use role playing in your classes. Undoubtedly, there are
students diagnosed either with the disorder or with a family member who has
been diagnosed with the disorder in your class and therefore, role playing any
disorder is inappropriate.

This lesson plan contains content outlines with terms and appropriate content
for the high school psychology class as well as critical thinking exercises. Class-
room activities and resources are provided together at the end of the lesson
plan. The activities for this lesson are to be taken as recommendations. More
than four hours of instructional activities have been included in this resource.
As such, teachers are encouraged to be flexible in choosing which activities to
use and which ones might be better left unused given time constraints. Addi-
tionally, teachers are encouraged to modify any suggested activity to make it
fit well with the needs of the students. New teachers especially may want to
focus on the terms and names provided in bold font in this lesson plan. These
key terms and figures highlight important parts of the content to present to
students in class.

Teachers have the choice and option of teaching the abnormal and treatment
units together. In this lesson plan, the authors have incorporated the DSM-5
to assist in the teaching of abnormal behavior.

LESSON 1

Perspectives on Treatment
This lesson covers the history of treatment of mental illnesses. Treatment professionals with
specialized training in mental health are introduced, and important background information is
provided for understanding treatment approaches in the larger context of the therapy relationship
and the research literature.

 identify as Eclectic or Integrative, indicating that they draw
 from two or more major approaches.
      Two things are important to keep in mind for the ma-
 jor approaches outlined in the following lessons:
        First, the treatment approach or theoretical orien-
 tation of the therapist is only part of what determines
 treatment effectiveness. The therapy relationship—the
 working relationship between the treatment provider
 and the client—is as important as the approach, and
“client factors” like readiness to change and pressures
 and relationships from life outside the therapy session
 are central in whether the treatment works (Norcross,
 2011). While it isn’t obvious, the working relationship be-
 tween practitioner and client is in fact important for suc-
 cessful treatment by medication, not just talk therapy.
      Second, for many psychological conditions there
 are multiple evidence-based medications and psycho-
 logical treatments that work. For example, treatments
 for major depressive disorder that have decades of solid
 research support include medication, interpersonal
 psychotherapy, and cognitive-behavioral psychother-
 apy. Other evidence-based treatments for depression
 include behavioral activation treatment, marital therapy,
 and others. Many providers practice evidence-based
 treatment, but it is important not to lose hope if a par-
 ticular evidence-based treatment does not work for a
 given client. Clients for whom one type of treatment
 does not work often will respond well to a second, dif-
 ferent evidence-based treatment.

Biomedical Treatments
Biomedical treatments include specific medical procedures and medications that can help
to alleviate symptoms of psychological disorders. Often, biomedical treatments are used in
conjunction with talk therapies. These treatments are often prescribed by a primary care physi-
cian or by a psychiatrist. Properly trained psychologists can also prescribe biomedical treat-
ments in a few states.

Psychoanalytic, Psychodynamic, and
Interpersonal Treatment Approaches
The psychoanalytic approach to therapy, associated with Sigmund Freud, is commonly referenced
in popular culture but is not widely practiced anymore. The more modern approaches covered in
this lesson continue the emphasis on helping the client develop insight into emotions and interper-
sonal patterns, but the therapist is much more active than a classical psychoanalyst and the treat-
ment takes substantially less time.

term interpersonal therapies tend to have clear ties to
psychoanalytic ideas. They usually include insight into the
early attachment and developmental origins of the client’s
expectations and behaviors in important current relation-
ships. Shorter term interpersonal therapies, like interper-
sonal therapy (IPT) for Depression (Klerman, Weissman,
Ronsaville, & Chevron, 1984), focus on one or two specific
current interpersonal patterns that precede or main-
tain the client’s presenting condition—e.g., depressive
episodes. Klerman et al.’s IPT is a treatment with substan-
tial research support for depression. A form of the treat-
ment for adolescents, called IPT-A, is demonstrated
effective for teens with depression.


CRITICAL THINKING EXERCISES:
•    Paying for the treatment of psychological disorders
     may be a large concern for many individuals and
     family members diagnosed with a disorder. With a
     partner or on their own, instruct students to search
     the internet for methods of paying for the various
     treatment options provided in this lesson plan. Stu-
     dents should understand what health insurance
     covers and research mental health parity laws and
     coverage requirements under the Affordable Care
     Act and what payment options exist for those with-
     out insurance or unable or unwilling to use insurance.
     Students should present their findings to the class.
•    Discuss the progression of traditional psychoana-
     lytic therapy evolving into psychodynamic therapy.

Humanistic Treatment Approaches
The therapies in this lesson are notable for their focus on a genuine, empathic therapy relationship
and intensive attention to the things that happen in the here-and-now of the therapy session. These
therapies have contributed substantially, through research on what happens in the therapy session,
to our understanding of the therapy relationship. The relationship is now recognized as important
across treatment approaches.

LESSON 5

Behavioral and Cognitive Treatment Approaches
Both treatment approaches addressed in this lesson have strong support from treatment outcome
research—that is, they are evidence-based treatments for many conditions. The behavioral approach
also is very firmly based in the basic psychological science of figures like Skinner and Pavlov. “Cogni-
tive-Behavioral” has become common in the vernacular, and students easily forget that the two terms
do not mean the same thing. While many modern therapists use both Behavioral and Cognitive
techniques in a course of treatment, it is useful for students to understand the distinctions between
the two. Key features of each are spelled out in this lesson.

 Cognitive therapy
 Aaron Beck is credited with developing cognitive therapy
 and his approach remains widely used in the treatment
 of depression. Cognitive schemas, methods for organiz-
 ing the way that we view the world, have evolved into a
 distorted perception. Examples of these beliefs include
 minimizing personal accomplishments. In other words,
 after a major accomplishment, a client may state that
“anybody could have succeeded,” thus minimizing his or
 her own success. A cognitive therapist would draw atten-
 tion to this faulty reasoning of the client. In other words,
 the therapist would challenge the validity of the state-
 ment. Therapy often includes a combination of homework
 assignments over a series of sessions. In the treatment of
 depression, a cognitive therapist would assign homework
 requiring the client to write down automatic thoughts, or
 the habitual thoughts, that precede feelings of depression.
      A structured form requires the client to write down
 the situation, emotion, automatic thought, rational re-
 sponse, and outcome. In this way, the cognitive schema
 is brought to the forefront of the client’s awareness. Cli-
 ents often are asked to find support for the automatic
 thought, and this discussion can occur in the therapeu-
 tic context.

Ethical and Legal Issues in Treatment
Professional organizations and state licensing boards are in place to help guide professional behav-
ior and protect the public from incompetent or unethical practitioners. The kinds of professionals
we have covered in this unit (e.g., psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, counselors) all have
professional organizations for guidance and additionally are subject to oversight from the state.
All must engage in continuing education in order to maintain their knowledge and skills and their
rights to practice in the state. Unfortunately for the public, many citizens are not aware of the need
to seek treatment from a licensed or otherwise verified professional. The term “therapist” is not
regulated, meaning anybody can call themselves a therapist and offer services whether or not they
have legitimate training and in the absence of a professional ethics code.

Instruct students to create poster boards to display either in their psychology
classroom or in their school cafeteria explaining the various treatment options
available in their community.

Note: This activity could also be a culminating activity at the end of the lesson plan.

The posters should include, but are not limited to, the following information.
It should also include a section mentioning different career options in clinical
or counseling psychology:
•    The name of the service providers
•    The credentials of the service providers
•    Areas of specialization of the service providers
•    Location of the facility
•    Ages of the clients
•    Specific psychological disorders treated at the facility

Empathy: The Cornerstone of Counseling
Peter S. Fernald, University of New Hampshire
L. Dodge Fernald, Harvard University

Reading a brief passage taken from an actual counseling session, the instructor plays the role of a sad and struggling
client. Students are provided with 10 statements that a counselor might think or say in reaction to what the client said.
The task is to identify which statements are empathic and which are not empathic. The activity provides students with

tion. Possible answers and discussion might focus on the
ways in which the two concepts both overlap and are
distinct. They overlap in the sense that both involve one
person attempting to understand the motives and emotions
of another person. It has been suggested that projection
is the basis of empathy. In so far as a therapist’s emotional
reaction to a particular circumstance—for example, sadness
or anger over the death of a parent—is the same as the
client’s reaction, projection may prove a basis for empathy.
     However, the concepts actually are quite distinct.
According to a psychoanalytic perspective, projection
occurs when one erroneously attributes his or her own
unwanted thoughts, motives, or feelings to another. The
more general definition of projection is a perception in-
fluenced by one’s needs, wishes, and hopes.
     Whether we refer to the classical or more general
definition, projection differs substantially from empathy.
Suppose, for example, that the therapist responding to
the passage in this activity had many unhappy childhood
experiences that he or she wished had never occurred.
In such a case, statement 9 would be regarded as a pro-
jection or, more specifically, as countertransference.

Client: I don’t feel very normal, but I want to feel that way. I thought I’d have
something to talk about—then, it all goes in circles. I was trying to think what
I was going to say.

Then, coming here, it doesn’t work out. I tell you, it seemed that it would be
much easier before I came. I tell you, I just can’t make a decision. I don’t know
what I want. I’ve tried to reason this thing out logically—tried to figure out which
things are important to me. I thought that there may be two things a man might
do. He might get married and raise a family. But if he was just a bachelor, just
making a living—that isn’t very good. I find myself and my thoughts getting
back to the days when I was a kid, and I’d cry very easily. The dam would break

wishes. My only thought was to get out when peace came. My problems, now
that I’m out, are as ever. I tell you, they go back to a long time before I was in
the army. I love children.

When I was in the Philippines—I tell you, when I was young I swore I’d never
forget my unhappy childhood—so when I saw these children in the Philippines,
I treated them very nicely. I used to give them ice cream cones and treat them
to movies. It was just a period—I’d reverted back—and that awakened some
emotions in me I thought I had long buried. (A pause. He seems very near

1.   I wonder if I should help you get started talking.
2.   Why your indecisiveness? What could be its cause?
3.   It’s really hard for you to get started talking.
4.   What is meant by your focus on marriage and family?
5. The crying and the dam sound as though there must be a great deal of
   repression.
6. Decision making just seems impossible to you.
7.   You want marriage, but it doesn’t seem to you to be much of a possibility.
8. You feel yourself brimming over with feelings reminiscent of your
   childhood.
9. At some point, you will probably need to dig into those early unhappy
   experiences.
10. Being very nice to children has somehow had meaning for you.

Using Psychological Perspectives to Change Habits
Rob McEntarffer, formerly of Lincoln Southeast High School, Lincoln, Nebraska

Introducing psychological perspectives can be a dry lecture and potentially confusing to students. It is usually done
toward the beginning of the semester, and the students have little context and few examples to use to make sense
of the perspectives. This activity gives them context by asking them to analyze a personal habit using psychological
perspectives. The students may also keep a journal documenting their habit changing in which they analyze the effec-
tiveness of their intervention and choice of perspective.

Think of a habit you would like to change. It can be a bad habit you want to get
rid of, or a good habit you want to acquire. Write here about the habit. What is
it? Why do you want to get rid of it or acquire it? What causes the habit?
     Now, take your habit and do some role-playing with it. Look back at your

For the next 2 weeks, please try to change your habit. Use the perspective

you managed to keep up your habit, etc. Basically, how is your intervention
working? How does the psychological perspective you chose apply to your

Students find psychological disorders and treatments fascinating, but they often confuse them. This activity, written for
classrooms of between 15 and 30 students, requires students to consider diagnoses for clients based on short case
histories and to recommend appropriate treatments. Students are challenged to apply the information they have learned
in this engaging way to review information taught in the disorder and treatments units.

Writing Component
Select a comic book super hero (such as one of the Marvel
comic heroes like Iron Man), consider a psychological
disorder they have manifested. Describe the signs and
symptoms they are exhibiting, decide upon a diagnosis,
determine treatment options and explain the process of
treatment.
    This is a great activity to culminate the abnormal
units, disorders and treatment, it provides a writing com-
ponent for the students to be creative and display all of
their expertise on these topics.

Case Histories
Cut out, separate, and paste each of the following descriptions onto a 3- by
5-inch index card.

Ken is plagued by constant worries that what he has planned will not occur as
scheduled. He makes hundreds of to-do lists each day and often checks these lists
to make sure they are correct. Ken incessantly reminds his colleagues of upcoming
deadlines, sometimes 15 or 20 times each day.

Karl, a star basketball player, has recently lost interest in playing or talking about
basketball. He has persistent feelings of sadness and worries he is not good at
anything anymore.

Julio believes he is an alien who has been left behind on Earth by his “pod.” He is
often difficult to understand, because he speaks frequently in rhyme and makes
up his own words.

Brian appears to be a mild-mannered 20-something, but he sometimes believes he
is a teenage female named “Suzy” who is a member of a high school dance team.
At these times, he dresses in various matching outfits, carries pom-poms, and prac-
tices various dance routines. Brian is confused about why he sometimes awakens
dressed in strange clothing.

Driving back from a concert, Gerri fell asleep at the wheel and crashed her Jaguar
convertible. Her best friend perished in the crash. Ever since, although doctors
can find nothing physically wrong, Gerri has been paralyzed in the arm with which
she was steering.

Keshona is terrified of speaking in public. Although highly knowledgeable and
competent, whenever she has to address a gathering of adults, her heart pounds,
and her mouth gets dry.

Tuan has been arrested on numerous occasions for disturbing the peace and for
illegally producing and selling alcohol and drugs to minors. Although a number of
his clients have died from overdoses, he feels no remorse.

While she was on a visit to the Midwest, Samantha’s residence was demolished
by a tornado. Ever since, she has been plagued by terrible nightmares and occa-
sional flashbacks.

Don goes through periods when he feels he just can’t lose. He goes on gambling sprees,
launches new get-rich-quick schemes, and engages in promiscuous behavior. At other
times, he feels so down that he can’t even get out of bed. Life seems purposeless.

No matter what he is doing, Ikimba always feels a little tense. The apprehension
has no apparent cause. Even during weekends and vacations, he experiences
constant uneasiness.

     In their new groups, each student reports what they
learned about their bullet point. Again, mingle amongst
the groups, answering questions.
     After students have finished sharing within their
groups, bring the class back together, and ask students
if they feel more informed about choosing a psychother-
apist than they did before class started. Answer any re-
maining questions.
      Now that students know the questions to ask a psy-
chotherapist, they still need to find a psychotherapist
to ask. For people who live in the US or Canada, APA
offers a helpful locator service: https://locator.apa.org/.
Use the drop-down menu to select a US state, a US ter-
ritory, or a Canadian province. Visitors are redirected to
the websites of those state, territorial, or provincial psy-
chological organizations that have their own searchable
provider databases.
     Remind students that one way they may be able to
help a loved one is by, with the loved one’s permission,
doing the legwork to find a practicing psychologist for
them. When you’re struggling and everything feels im-
possible, finding a practicing psychologist could feel
like an impossible task (Murphy, 2018).
