5 Core Principles of
Customer Care



Want to improve customer
satisfaction? Adopt these five
core customer care principles.
Overview


W
           hat company isn’t looking to improve customer satisfaction in today’s highly competitive
           marketplace? Customers who give you a 5 on a scale of 1 to 5 are six times more likely to buy
           from you again than those who “only” give you a score of 4.8. Customers are the lifeblood
of an organization. Their satisfaction is closely linked to retention (and its less attractive sibling, churn),
repeat business, and the positive word of mouth that attracts new customers.

To satisfy customers, you simply have to resolve
their issues and do it quickly. Easier said than done.
At minimum, customers expect to be listened
to and understood, taken seriously, treated with
respect, and to receive timely action. To earn top
Net Promoter scores or 5s on a CSAT survey, you
have to do more.

In this eBook, we’ll talk about some core principles
of customer care that drive strong customer
satisfaction scores. There are, of course, essential
skills that should be demonstrated by anyone in a frontline customer service position, and Impact
Learning Systems has a lot of information to offer you in that arena. But for now, our focus is on five key
principles that are relevant to anyone who manages or trains a customer service team.

Introduction
                                                                           The following principles derive
                                                                           from work performed with many
                                                                           organizations to assist them in their
                                                                           efforts to establish a culture of world-
                                                                           class service. The principles outlined
                                                                           here are key to that endeavor—
                                                                           regardless of industry. Of course it’s
                                                                           difficult to pare it down to only five
                                                                           principles—certainly there are many
                                                                           more that can be considered—but
                                                                           this should provide a good starting
                            point for anyone trying to build and maintain a strong customer care culture in their
                            own organization.



                                                                                        Did You Know?!
                                                                                         If you can resolve an issue or
                                                                                        fix a problem of a complaining

                                                                                          the customer will come back

“Customer Care” Defined

The concept of “customer care” needs to be
distinguished from “skills.”
                            There are some essential skills that should be demonstrated by anyone in a frontline
                            customer care position, and Impact Learning Systems certainly has a lot of information
                            to offer you in that arena, but for now, let’s focus on some key principles that are
                            relevant to anyone who manages or trains a customer care team, as well as to the
                            customer care representatives themselves.

                            After each principle, some relevant questions to reflect on will be introduced. The
                            aim is to help you assess whether this principle is being put into practice in your own
                            organization. Let’s take a look.


                                                                                          Customer Care
                                                                                         (noun) The work of looking
                                                                                        after customers and ensuring
                                                                                         their satisfaction with your
                                                                                          business and its goods or
                                                                                                    services.

Customer Care Principle #1
The first principle is that to customers, frontline representatives are the company. Customers
don’t usually know or see what goes on behind the scenes, so their impression of your organization stems from what
we call “customer touchpoints.” These customer touchpoints occur any time a customer comes into contact with
                                 your company and uses that experience to form an impression of your organization.
                                 Frontline employees, whether they’re communicating face-to-face, on the telephone,
                                 or via e-mail, are in direct and constant communication with your customers. An
                                 investment in the skills and knowledge of these employees is very much an investment
                                 in the customer experience.

                                             To ensure that these customer touchpoints are leaving a favorable impression, here
                                             are a few questions for you to consider:

                                             
                                              Do frontline employees view themselves as ambassadors of the
                                                  organization?

                                             
                                              Are they trained in communication skills?

                                             
                                              Are they empowered to do the needful (within reason) for customers?

                                             
                                              Are you aware of the various customer touchpoints that occur in your
                                                  organization?

Customer Care Principle #2
Studies have shown that a strong link exists between employees’ job satisfaction and the quality of customer
service those employees provide. (Really no surprise there.) Customer care—whether that means selling shoes or
fixing servers—is an intrinsically rewarding profession. Simply put, it feels good to be of service to someone, to
make something good happen to another person. This is the kind of attitude that motivates employees to create a
strong culture of customer care. But it doesn’t typically happen unless the employees themselves feel valued by their
company and satisfied with their jobs. It may sound obvious, but it’s worth noting:

If employees aren’t satisfied on the job, they’re usually not motivated to
demonstrate a high level of customer care.
At best, they’ll do just enough to get by.

The following are some key questions to ask yourself about employee satisfaction at your organization:

               
                What is the turnover rate for your customer-facing employees?
               
                How do you measure employee satisfaction and motivation?
               
                When employee satisfaction is low, what do you do about it?
               
                Do performance issues in your organization stem from an employee’s attitude or from his or her
                    skill level?

Your answers to these questions will tell you what’s needed in order to build a culture of strong customer care.

Customer Care Principle #3
The third key principle of customer care is to show customers that they’re valued by your
company. Many organizations make the mistake of assuming that customers know this. Of course, the most
important aspect of showing customers that they’re valued is to take care of their needs or requests in a timely,
efficient, and correct manner. At each and every customer touchpoint, maintain a mindset of earning the business
and trust of customers. Never take it for granted.

But customers have needs that go beyond the transaction. They want to be appreciated and respected. They want
to feel that your company’s customer care philosophy is just that: Care. So it doesn’t hurt to tell them directly. Before
ending a call or a face-to-face visit, employees should take a moment to tell the customer that their business is
appreciated. It can go a long way.

Here are three questions to keep in mind:

               
                If you were a customer of your organization, would you feel valued?
               
                When closing a call or other type of customer transaction, are employees expected to thank
                    customers for their business?
               
                Do customer-facing employees understand the importance of earning a customer’s trust and
                    loyalty on an ongoing basis?

The good news is, putting this principle into action is usually a pretty simple step.

Customer Care Principle #4
All too often, companies place a strong emphasis on external
customer care while losing sight of the fact that internal
customers matter just as much. Why? Because
somewhere down the line, the service you provide to an internal
customer will show up in an external customer transaction. An
internal customer is any employee who depends on the timing,
quality, and accuracy of your work in order for them to succeed
in their own work. Those organizations in which a customer
care culture is truly embedded do not make distinctions about
internal and external care. Each employee’s mission is simply to
demonstrate excellence with each and every task.

To help you assess the level of internal customer service in your organization, ask yourself the following questions:

               
                Do your employees know who their internal customers are?
               
                Are employees measured on the service they provide to internal customers?
               
                Do they recognize that everyone in the organization is a service provider?

If you feel that you might need work in any of these areas, the next principle can help.

Customer Care Principle #5
                                                       You cannot expect people to perform to expectations until you’ve given
                                                       them the knowledge and skills to do just that. If you’re serious about
                                                       embracing a culture of customer care, you need to
                                                       educate employees as to what this notion looks like
                                                       on the job. It shouldn’t be taken for granted that employees know what
                                        goes into good customer service—internal or external. They may have some
                                        good instincts, and they may each take certain measures that they personally
                                        feel will provide good service, but this hopeful and hodgepodge approach
                                        isn’t enough. Providing them training in both your company’s customer care
                                        philosophy and in their job-specific service skills is a huge and all-important
step. Once employees have been trained, it’s essential for them to be held accountable for putting the skills into
practice on the job. This, of course, means strong and consistent coaching on an ongoing basis.

Finally, once you’ve trained employees and held them accountable for putting their training into practice on the job,
be sure to reward them for their success.

Formula for Success
Here at Impact Learning Systems, we believe that strong performance in the area of customer care is a matter of a
simple formula:

Training + Coaching = Success
The questions that follow will help you to assess where you stand in those two
disciplines:

                
                 Do employees know what’s expected of them?
                
                 Do they have the knowledge, skills, and competencies to provide great
                    service to internal and external customers?
                
                 Do supervisors and managers provide regular, constructive, and skilled
                    coaching to employees?
                
                 Are employees rewarded for their success?

If your answer to any of these questions is no, it’s time to take a look at your training and
coaching and possibly move them up the priority list.

Summary
To recap, the five customer care principles discussed are as follows:


                           Principle #1: To customers, frontline employees are the company.
                           Principle #2: Employee satisfaction matters!
                           Principle #3: Show customers they’re valued. Don’t assume they know it.
                           Principle #4: Internal customer care is as important as external customer care.
                           Principle #5: Train your staff to deliver great service—and hold them accountable.
