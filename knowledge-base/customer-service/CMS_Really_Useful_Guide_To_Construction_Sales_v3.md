give yourself an edge. And then we’ll get as practical as we
can, with down-to-earth sections on how to place a phone
call that gets results, how to follow up, and how to win the
work you want.

That, ultimately, is what it’s all about: winning the contracts
you want most. Not whatever work is going. Not more of the
same unrewarding, low margin projects. Sales is not about
letting work come to you. It’s pro-active. It’s about locating
the jobs you want, and going and getting them.

It’s what I do for a living, hunting down work for my clients,
and I’ve seen how powerful it can be for a company. A
campaign of pro-active sales can genuinely transform a
business, taking it up a level, breaking into new markets and
delivering growth.

I’ve already shared some of the basics in The Really
Useful Guide to Construction Marketing. If you haven’t
downloaded that resource, I’d encourage you to do so. It
will make sure that the foundations are in place for a more
targeted sales approach. But if you’re ready, let’s see what
sales can do for you.

Marketing vs. sales: what’s the
difference?
As I write and talk about my job, I often end up referring to
both sales and marketing, sometimes interchangeably.
Which might leave you wondering – what exactly is the
difference between them? Where does one end and the
other begin?

In simple terms, marketing is the major discipline
covering all aspects of product, pricing, people and profit
maximisation. Sales is the pro-active ‘get out there and
sell’ element of the wider marketing discipline.                “Sales is a more

about your company. From the website to promotional
materials, to the brand and how it is applied, it’s all about
communicating who you are and what you stand for. It
tells your story and broadcasts your identity. Usually, it
does so indiscriminately – you can’t control who sees your
van with the logo and strapline on the side, for example.
Everyone in the street sees it, whether or not they’re in the
market for your services.

Sales is a more focused field of work. Where marketing
talks to everyone, sales zeroes in on key clients. Where
marketing communicates information, sales aims to build
relationships.




05      The Really Useful Guide to Construction Sales
It’s one to one, targeted to specific clients or potential clients,
and it’s personalised. It builds on the background information
of marketing, and applies it to particular contexts: here’s
what our business could mean for you, how we can work
together, the solutions we can offer to your specific needs.

Because it is strategic, sales is very effective at generating
the right kinds of enquiries – the kind of clients you want,
the kind of work you’re good at and enjoy doing. You can’t
sit back and wait for those sorts of jobs to come to you. You
have to get on the phone and chase them down.



Sales in construction: what makes it
so special?
Sales is a particular skill in any business sector, and every
sector has its nuances. Construction sales, however, is
particularly specialist.

As almost everyone in construction will know, the industry
in the UK is unique in having an extraordinarily good
forward view on billions of pounds worth of upcoming
construction jobs.

This potential new business is all logged in the planning
applications and approvals system, and then through the
tenders and contract awards data services that follow on
from planning.

Virtually every new building project of any real value is
documented, from small home extensions under £50k
to major new schemes up to £1bn or more. They’re all
tracked, researched and known about well before most
buying decisions are made.




06      The Really Useful Guide to Construction Sales
This means that every construction and property company,
from small local builders and specialist sub-contractors to
major national contractors, have one of the most powerful
sales and marketing tools in the country at their disposal.
Seriously – marketers in other sectors can only dream of
the kind of market intelligence that the planning process
provides.

Construction sales leads are the key to pro-active sales,
and to hunting down the kinds of jobs you want most. You
can use them to find the kind of projects you’re best at, at
the right value, time and place – and go after them. All the
information you need to do this is publicly available through
the planning process.

We’ll get into how to navigate the vast ocean of data from the
planning system, and how to find what you need. First, we
just need to check the rigging, so to speak.

 Marketing as the platform for sales
 Before you can sell yourself as a company, you have to
 know what you’re selling. Even if you have a very clear idea
 of who you are and what you’re doing, it’s worth pausing
 to think about your brand distinctives. What makes you
 different? What can you offer that others can’t? Can you
 name your strengths? Why are you a better choice from
 everyone else in the running?

 Sales needs a solid marketing foundation, and that
 begins with brand identity. When you’re on the phone to
 a potential client, and you’ve got 30 seconds to tell them
 why they should give you the contract, you’ve got to have
 your answer ready.

 Then you’ve got to be able to back it up. Does your
 website, your brochures, or your van livery communicate
 the same message that you do? You don’t need anything
 highly sophisticated or expensive, but make sure that a
 poorly-designed or out-of-date website isn’t undermining
 your good work elsewhere.




“Before you can sell yourself
 as a company, you have to
 know what you’re selling.




 08     The Really Useful Guide to Construction Sales
The telephone is going to be your main tool for sales,
but when you’ve spoken to someone for the first time,
they’re going to look you up. You might send them a letter
or an information pack. As well as marketing assets, this
is about people too. If a prospective client phones the
office, are they going to hear a similar message from your
colleagues as they do from you?

A sales strategy needs some foundations. Before you get
started, make sure that you can check off everything on
this list:

     • A clear and effective corporate identity, shared
       across everyone on your team. What do you stand
       for? What makes you distinctive?

     • An attractive and memorable brand that expresses
       this corporate identity, consistently applied, and
       that communicates trust and professionalism.

     • Marketing resources for introducing the company
       and following up contacts – website, brochure,
       letter-heads, etc.

     • Evidence to back up your marketing claims, such
       as case studies or testimonials. Give new clients
       confidence by showing off your best work.

How does your firm perform? If there’s anything that could
be improved, take the time to do that first. The stronger
your marketing platform, the more effective your sales
staff an be when they hit the phones.

10   The Really Useful Guide to Construction Sales
Focusing your sales
So, you’ve got the foundations in place. You and your team
are committed to the long-term growth of the business.
You’re ready to tap into the mine of information in the
planning system and start hunting down work. There’s just
one problem: there are over 340 local planning authorities
around the country. It’s time for a system. And it’s time to
focus.

First of all, every construction sales professional needs
a source of sales leads to work from. There are four main
providers, the best known being Glenigan and Barbour
ABI. We’ll come to them and their competitors shortly, to
help you decide which service is best for you.

Whichever provider you choose, you’ll be able to specify
what you want to see using a broad range of filters. They
will allow you to narrow down the vast tide of information
coming out of the planning system into a manageable
stream of top quality opportunities. They could include:

     • Location – work that is closer to you and your team,
       or in a region you want to expand into.

     • Price – jobs in the right price bracket for your firm,
       where the margins are good and where you have
       demonstrable experience.

     • Expertise – projects that are in your wheelhouse or
       where you have particular skills.

     • Sector – residential or commercial, education,
       healthcare, retail – whatever your preferred sub-
       section of construction, you can find leads to suit
       your needs.




11      The Really Useful Guide to Construction Sales
     • Specialty – perhaps you have a niche interest, such
       as the luxury market, heritage refurbishments,
       or sustainable construction. Look for jobs that fit
       these interests.

     • Satisfaction – don’t forget your own personal
       preferences. Which jobs are the most rewarding?
       Look for work that you know you’ll enjoy.

Use search criteria like these to exclude the jobs that
aren’t going to be of interest. Once you’ve got a source of
incoming tender enquiries, it’s time to start turning them
into tenders and then into contracts.




Finding future contracts
If you’ve set up your criteria correctly, you’ll now be
getting a stream of potential projects from your sales lead
provider. For example, a smaller builder might focus on
architect-led projects in the £100k-£400k range, within
an hour’s drive. It’s a good strategy: architect-led projects
offer four to six-month build periods, and reliable cash-
flow based on architects’ valuations. For them, that’s
where growth lies, and a thriving business with a healthy
work-life balance.

Those are what I call the A* jobs. What are yours?

A* projects will be those that meet all your needs. Every
week, ruthlessly eliminate any projects that aren’t right
for you. Then select the most promising project leads to
follow up each week by telephone. If you were to follow up
8-10 quality new leads a week, I’d expect to net perhaps 2 -
4 targeted tenders every month.

Be wary of taking on too much. Only go for A* projects,
and concentrate on a manageable number each week.
Focus on the very best opportunities; it will pay you
dividends.




12      The Really Useful Guide to Construction Sales
Remember what I said at the outset, that marketing is
about communicating information, and sales is about
building relationships. That means that you’re using sales
leads to find clients, not just jobs. Perhaps an architect
doesn’t have the right project for you at this moment, but
you’d like to work with them in future. Use the sales lead
to get in touch and get on their radar for next time. When
a project comes up that’s a good fit for you, they’ll already
know your name.

A good sales person brings in tendering opportunities,
but they’re also building a network, compiling a contacts
book, getting to know a wide range of work providers and
raising your profile among the right people.
                                                                “A good sales

                                                                 network
I also look out for what I call ‘aliens’: architects or
developers working outside of their usual patch. If they
don’t work in your area often, they won’t have as many
contacts and you have a better chance of winning the
work if you introduce yourself.

If you’ve got an eye on growing your business, then
be ambitious in what you pitch for. You know what you
realistically have a chance of winning, but use sales leads
to get your name in the hat for slightly bigger contracts
than you’re used to. It can be more work to chase down
these jobs, so you want to go after three or four bread-
and-butter projects for every bigger one. I call them
flagships, because they’re the jobs you’ll want to put front




13      The Really Useful Guide to Construction Sales
and centre on the website, and feature as case studies.
Don’t chase all big jobs. Bigger tenders will come quite
naturally as you prove yourself. But see if you can take on
one flagship project at a time, balanced with two or three
medium jobs and some smaller ones. It’ll get the best out
of your workforce and help to maintain cash flow.

Using sales leads in this way can get a business out of a
rut of similar jobs, and onto the kinds of projects you’ve
always wanted to do.




Choosing a sales lead provider
With only a handful of services to choose from, selecting
a sales leads provider is relatively straightforward. To
summarise, there are two major services in Barbour
ABI and Glenigan, and two smaller services that serve
opposite ends of the process – Planning Pipe covering
the planning stages and Builders Conference tracking
tenders and contracts.

Which one works best for you will depend on what you
need.

Larger builders and developers will benefit from access
to well-researched projects as early as possible, and so
will want to consider one of the big two. Small to medium
builders and main contractors will be getting involved as
projects reach planning, and so Planning Pipe will ideally
suit their needs.

Planning Pipe offers full UK service of the 250,000+
planning applications every year together with approved
details.




14     The Really Useful Guide to Construction Sales
You can be highly specific about the type of project you
want, the area coverage (towns, counties and postcodes)
and more. It’s also exceptional value for money with
subscriptions starting at £49 per month, and a growing
number of our clients would count themselves as satisfied
customers of Planning Pipe’s services.

Subcontractors are going to be more interested in
the tenders and contract stage of the process, and so
Builders Conference might be a better fit.

That might narrow it down for you, but ask around. See
what the various services will cost you, and you can
get more detail about each of the four providers on our
website if you need a bit more guidance. Get those sales
leads coming in, and then it’s time to pick up the phone
and start winning work.

Winning
The Work




16   The Really Useful Guide to Construction Sales
Before you call
It’s time to get practical. You’ve done the groundwork.
You’ve filtered your data and sourced your first sales leads.
They’re sorted and graded, and you have a shortlist of A*
leads. Let’s get down to brass tacks – what are you going to
do with them?

This is where the old-fashioned telephone becomes your
most powerful tool.

For some people this is difficult and intimidating. Others find
it easy. However you feel about the prospect, the first thing
you want to do is take two or three minutes to prepare. If
you’re nervous about calling, this will give you confidence.
If you’re already confident, it’ll make sure you don’t rush
things and miss something important. And most of all, it will
make your call more efficient.

Look up the architect’s website. Study the type of work
they do. Scroll through project photos on the gallery
page. Architects are often pleased that you have taken
the trouble to look at some of their jobs, and that you have
something to say about their work.

Check to see if their team details are on the website (and
if so, check their names and titles). The call will go more
easily when you have an idea of who you’re speaking
to. Your preparation will show, and that demonstrates
professionalism and makes you easier to trust.

Don’t forget to visit the online planning portal. Look at the
details of the project you’re chasing. Planning Pipe leads
always have the planning reference number and name of
the relevant council. It’s helpful to look at the submitted
planning drawings – the elevations, floorplans, the design
and access statement. Double check this is a job you really
are suited to. You don’t want to find out late in the day that
there are extra challenges that you’re not prepared for.




17      The Really Useful Guide to Construction Sales
When you speak with the architect, weave your research
into the conversation. Show you’re a serious builder who
has taken the trouble to be informed.

One last tip: don’t put off your calls, but don’t rush them
either. When a new project lead appears in the late
planning stage, there’s always a wave of interest. A lot of
builders will get in touch at once. Hold off a week or two to
make your call stand out!                                            “When you
                                                                      speak with the

qualms about this, but one of the reasons that people                 conversation.
don’t like calling about a job is that it feels like cold calling.
And we all know the clichés about cold calling and how
annoying it is.

But think of it this way: architects need builders just as
much as builders need architects. If there’s a project to
talk about, you know they need a good builder! Think of it
as matchmaking, or brokering. You’re providing an answer
to the question that you know they have – the question
of who is going to do the work. Think of yourself as the
solution to their problem, and you’ll realise that your call is
far from a nuisance.

Now that you’re picking up and dialing, consider how you
want to come across. Your tone of voice has a big part to
play here. Think of it like acting: no matter how you feel,
project your voice in a friendly, warm and professional
way.

Smile when you’re on the phone. I know that sounds
corny, but any radio broadcaster will tell you the same.
Your listener will sense the warmth of a smile. It brings a
brightness and positivity to your tone. You only have one
tool to work with when you’re on the phone and that’s your
voice – so make the most of it!




18      The Really Useful Guide to Construction Sales
If you can, inject a little humour into the conversation, too.
They will certainly remember you, for all the best reasons.

Occasionally, an architect has all the builders they need
and will turn you away. But that’s not how it usually goes.
Most architects are always open to good builders.

Of course it’s disappointing to be turned down, but how
we deal with it is important. Reject the pushy stereotypes
and respect a “no” answer when it’s given. Never argue.
If the job is gone or they already have someone lined
up, don’t try to force your way in. That will only damage
the prospects of future work. A gracious response to a
negative answer will win you respect, and that’s helping to
build the relationship for the future.

If they say it’s already gone to tender? Smile, and wish
them well with the job. Afterwards, you can ask about
future job opportunities. A call is rarely wasted, and
if you’ve come across well, you will have got on the
architect’s radar.

Sales is a long term discipline. It’s also a learned skill,
and that means that practice makes perfect. Don’t be
disappointed if you feel out of your depth at first. The more
you call, the better you’ll get. One way to improve your
skills is to listen to someone who knows how to do it. It can
be very helpful to spend an hour listening to an expert,
observing how they prepare and how they introduce
themselves.

We can help you with this directly - you can hire a CMS
professional for some coaching. They call and you listen.
Then you call, and they listen. This can be a insightful
way to spend half a day, and it can quickly boost your
confidence.

Leaving effective voicemail
Sometimes you’re going to call and get a voicemail
message. Naturally it’s tempting to hang up. Perhaps
you’ll even breathe a sigh of relief, if you’re new to sales
calls. But let your competitors do that! You’re going to
demonstrate your genuine interest by leaving a message,
and that will improve your odds.

Besides, if you don’t leave a message, it’s a wasted
contact. Get the full value out of every call you place by
leaving them the important information.

On that point, leaving a message can feel like being put
on the spot. It’s worth writing out a quick script for a good
voicemail, so that you don’t wing it and miss out something
crucial on the spur of the moment. After a few times it will
be second nature and you won’t need to consult it.

Experience suggests around one in five architects
will respond to a warm and interesting voicemail that
emphasizes the expertise you bring to the job and call you
back. If an architect does call it’s always a warm opening
for a conversation.

The Five Stages of a
Successful Call
1. The Personal Intro Your architect contact answers.
Keep it short, friendly and cheerful.

“Good morning, James! I wonder if you could help me for
a moment? I’m ____________ of XXX Builders, close to you
in ____________. Like yourselves, we specialise in good
quality residential work. I was very interested to look at your
website just now.”

2. The reason I’m calling – the job in mind.

“I wondered if I could ask your advice about the proposed
new-build house on Western Road in Keston?” It’s the type
of work we specialise in, and I’d really appreciate your help
on this one in terms of progress.”

3. The benefits we have to offer – which we’ve hinted at in
the first two stages. But as the conversation continues we
can perhaps add more detail here. Again – not a long spiel
– just a few seconds, but make it count. Ask the question,
then answer it: What value can we add here?

“Keston is within very easy reach – just half an hour from
the office and we have a number of trades who live close to
this site. Or – I was very interested to look at the Design &
Access Statement on the planning portal – it’s very similar
to several other houses we built recently – may be worth my
forwarding the case studies over to you?”

4. Listen – Make sure you listen and write down what
you hear. You need to put some of this in the email you’re
going to be sending to the architect after your call.




21      The Really Useful Guide to Construction Sales
 Get the other person to talk about their project and what
 interests them. You’ll be surprised how much some people
 will tell you. Get the other person talking, and listen. My old
 boss used to say – You have two ears and one mouth – use
 them in that proportion!

 5. Ask good questions – As a sales person, you’re looking
 to get your company in the hat for the project that’s caught
 your eye. But your call is also information gathering. What
 you find out will inform your follow up calls and when to make
 them. You’re looking for the names of any other decision
 makers you might need to contact. And with a view to the
 future, you might get advance notice of upcoming projects
 and get in early.

 Here are some important questions to drop into the
 conversation.

 a. What’s the current stage at planning?
 b. Is it likely to go to tender?
 c. Who might assemble the tender list?
 d. What’s the budget value?
 e. Is there a QS appointment? If so – who?
 f. We’re interested - when should I call you back on this one?
 g. By the way – any other projects that may tender soon?
 h. Check their email address and spelling of their name




“Get the other person to talk
 about their project and what
 interests them.

Following up well
Any sales person can make a call. It’s the ones that follow-
up properly that deliver the goods time after time. It’s
not difficult, but it pays to be systematic and persistent.
There’s a general rule in sales that it takes around seven
contacts to land a tender. Nobody is going to hand it to
you after a cold call. It’ll take an initial phone conversation,
an email, a follow-up call, a letter with case studies, a
possible meeting, and so on.

Remember, sales is about relationship building.

You need the architect or the client to trust you enough
with a significant budget, and they might never have heard
of you before. So build trust with little steps. In that first
call, tell them that you will follow up by email. When you do,
you’ve demonstrated that you’re a person that keeps their
promises.

Also in that first call, ask when they want you to call back.
It’s rare for anyone to tell you not to. Instead, they’ll give
you their most convenient time. Make a note and call back
then. It’s better for them, and you’ll catch them when they
have time to talk. It’s better for you too, because it saves
you a wasted call or another answerphone message. And
here’s the secret power of a planned phone call: it shows
that you’re a person who keeps to time. It’s such a little
thing, but it’s significant. Not showing up on time and not
getting things done when you said you would are such
common gripes about builders! Just by timing your call
back, you’ve set yourself apart.

Each small step you can take like this will be a step ahead
of your competitors.




23      The Really Useful Guide to Construction Sales
 If you’re going to do this with every contact, it should
 be obvious that you’ll need a system. You can soon end
 up with hundreds of contacts to keep track of, and this
 isn’t going to run on post-it notes and a whiteboard.
 Invest in a sales admin system and an online contact
 management database. This will help you to track all your
 conversations. When you phone someone, you can bring
 up notes on previous calls and have all the specifics of the
 project to hand.

 Once your system is up and running, you’ll be able to
 review the last conversation before you call, and update
 the notes afterwards for next time. Keep notes brief and to
 the point, so that you spend more time on the phone and
 less on data entry.

 As well as the details of the job, you might want to make
 occasional entries about the person you’re talking to –
 little personal things about them. They might mention they
 like sailing for example, or that they’re just in from walking
 the dog. If it sounds important to them, make a note and
 you can ask about it when you call again. Always keep
 calls professional and don’t force it, but a quick question
 about something meaningful for them will build rapport. (It
 certainly beats the bland introductory comment about the
 weather that opens so many conversations!)

 This isn’t about gathering data on a person in order to win
 them over. It’s respecting them as individuals with their
 own lives and interests.




“Remember, sales is about
 relationship building.

Ten keys to maximise the tender
stage
When you get the opportunity to tender, you’ll be passing
on the project to the estimating team and it might feel
like your job is done. It’s not! The best construction sales
professionals stick with it through the tender period and
help to bring the contract over the line.

Think of your tender as a major sales document in its own
right.

Even if there are other tender prices submitted, some
tenderers may fail to follow-up. Genuine interest and a
courteous follow-up will boost your chances of a win. To        “The best stick
give a specific example, I remember one of my builder            with it through
clients winning a £750,000 tender for a new-build high-          the tender
end house in Surrey. This builder was third of three on
the list and £50k above the lowest bid. What made the            period and help
difference and won them the job? An excellent tender             to bring the
presentation - fully detailed with cost breakdowns, an           contract over
evident interest in the job and a willingness to negotiate.
                                                                 the line.
To increase your chances at the tender stage, here are ten
key actions you need to take when your price goes in.

1. Find the decision makers – Who makes the definitive
yes or no? Very often the client is strongly influenced by
the architect. Or it could be a family member who is a QS.
It’s frustrating to make your case only for someone to say
“I’ll pass that on”. Asking about the decision maker early in
the process will ensure you are talking to the right person!




25      The Really Useful Guide to Construction Sales
2. Is your tender detailed and impressive?– Another of
the builders I work with has developed the best tender
format I’ve seen. It’s a 16-page document, sent in pdf and
hard copy to both client and architect. This is always
remarked on by the architect and/or client. A good tender
goes a long way to securing future work opportunities. He
includes:

     • quality covers
     • a thank you letter that affirms the builder’s keen
       interest and commitment to the job
     • the tender offer, followed by two elemental cost
       breakdowns
     • an appendix with potential cost savings, which
       really adds value for the client
     • relevant case studies of recent, similar jobs that
       prove they can deliver

3. Look for potential cost savings – These cannot be part
of the actual tender – but they can be in an appendix. If the
job comes in over budget, or if you’re a close number two
on the list, your consideration of savings may be crucial.

4. Submit on time or a day early! – You’d be surprised
how many builders submit late without informing the
architect. There’s no better way to damage a reputation. If
you have no option – in case of illness, for example – then
alert the architect without delay, and give a date when you
can get the price in. You’ll always get respect for being
open.

5. Be open if you can’t do it after all – If you learn halfway
through the process that you can’t tender for the project
this time, for whatever reason, tell the architect as soon
as possible. You will earn brownie points for honesty. If
you wait to inform the architect, you could put them in a
difficult situation with their client. Tell them early, and they
may have time to secure another builder to tender. Then
they will appreciate your openness, and that will boost
your chances next time.




26      The Really Useful Guide to Construction Sales
6. Check receipt and say thank you – When you’ve
submitted your price, call right away to check that your
tender has been received, and say thank you for the
opportunity. Gratitude goes a long way in construction and
will predispose the architect towards you. It’s also a perfect
opportunity to ask if it would be okay to ring back in a week
to check in.

7. Call again a week later – as suggested above, call
back. Most architects are comfortable with a follow-up
call. Ask if all the prices are back and politely inquire about
where you stand. You aren’t going to hear much detail, but
they may indicate if your price is of interest. Confirm your
willingness to look at cost reductions or negotiate – that
may be enough to move you up the ladder if there’s no clear
favourite.

8. Stay involved – If you’re committed at the start of the
job, there’s a good likelihood you’ll be committed all the
way through. Architects, clients and Quantity Surveyors
appreciate builders who show genuine interest. If the
client’s budget needs £15k off to make it work, how can you
find that £15k for them? Or if they want to add something
late in the day – can you re-price to allow for that?

9. Lose graciously – I’ll be honest: you’re going to lose
more than you win. That’s absolutely normal, and I if you win
one in four you’re doing fine. So make sure you use the bad
news as an opportunity. When you hear that you weren’t
successful, be gracious in defeat. Your time will come. Wish
them well with the job, find out who did win it and then ask
about the next job coming out to tender.

10. Picture the long game – See beyond the job in front of
you. Concentrate on building a solid working relationship
with the architect. You’re not just chasing jobs, you’re
building a relationship with a work provider. Over the next
few years, that could pay you returns worth millions of
pounds.

In conclusion
If you’ve read this far, hopefully you now have a good
understanding of construction sales, what makes it
distinctive, and how powerful it could be for your business.
Over the course of my career, I’ve seen countless firms
benefit from the sales process I’ve outlined here. Some
have gone from small to large companies. Some have
saved themselves from the brink of bankruptcy. Others
have used sales to shift into a new line of work, or break a
dependency on one big work provider.
