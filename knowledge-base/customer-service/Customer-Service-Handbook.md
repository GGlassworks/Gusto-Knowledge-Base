   Introduction

   The person on the receiving end of your
   company’s product and service is often referred
   to as “customer,” “guest,” “client,” “tourist,”
   and “visitor.” One thing is certain; these people
   are looking for a quality experience from the
   beginning. In fact, they are expecting it! If
   their expectations are not met, they become
   disappointed and often take their business
   elsewhere. So we can clearly see that quality
   does have value.


Quality is a process. There are performance standards that must be
in place. These must be communicated and implemented at all levels
in the establishment. They require leadership from the manager or
owner. These customer service standards need to be monitored,
reviewed, and updated regularly.

Customer expectation must be recognized and acted upon.
Ask yourself if your definition of quality is the same as what the
customer expects. Our customers are educated, perceptive and
demanding. When they make a reservation, order a meal, book a
guided trip, or check into a room, they have certain expectations.
You must identify whether you are falling short, meeting or
exceeding their expectation of quality.


Your success is built on how
well you deliver!
This customer service handbook attempts to provide tips, popular
dos and don’ts, helpful hints, and checklists as well as proven
best practices in a customer setting. It addresses the view from
management, staff and the customer and their role in the chain of
the Quality Service Experience.

A Customer or Tourists is:
 ► The most important person we do business with

 ► Not dependent on us; rather we on him/her for their
   business

 ► Not an interruption of our work but the purpose for it

 ► A person who expects satisfaction and value for
   money spent

 ► An educated consumer who is aware of your
   competition

 ► A person who should be treated with respect and
   cared for to the best of your ability, no matter who
   they are

 ► A person to build a future with

 ► A source of information to help improve our business

 ► A pleasure to serve

 ► An opportunity, not an imposition

For Owners, Managers and Supervisors
Two of the biggest downfalls of customer service training are that
the subject is either swept under the “welcome mat” or it is treated
as a special training event only.

Hospitality operations are particularly aware of the challenges. Due
to the nature and diversity of most operations, and other factors
such as budget and time constraints, there just never seems to be
any time or money allocated for this purpose.

The importance of creating successful customer service standards
cannot be overemphasized and relies upon the initial implementation
of the ideology. Training is crucial, and perhaps the most difficult
step is maintaining and monitoring the customer service process
and results.

Creating Good
Customer Service Standards for the Eclipse
Twelve Keys to Developing Good Tourism Service
      Start at the top

01    If you are in a leadership role you must first and foremost
      lead by example.
      Your words and actions must correspond accordingly so
      that the staff can model implementation based on the
      clear example.

      Measure First
02    Before embarking on a major customer service safari, such
      as Eclipse of 2024-assess your current service level and
      identify what needs attention and improvement.
      Traditional data such as customer letters, complaints,
      feedback and surveys are tools to get you started. Don’t
      forget to approach your staff because they have firsthand
      experience in the matter.

      Make a training plan
03    Goals related to customer service need to be a
      component within the eclipse strategy. Align with core
      values you already incorporate and make their way to the
      training floor. Make service a priority in your business.

      Train staff/volunteers and make them accountable
04    While managers work in a customer service environment
      daily, they play a critical role in the service challenge and
      are responsible for providing leadership.
      Managers must have the mind and skill set to lead staff
      and volunteers through the days.

      Stay focused
05    Hotels and properties versus camping and land owners will
      all have a different focus area. While there will be some
      overlap, make sure you are focused on what your area is
      responsible for.




                              7       Customer Service Handbook
     Launch
06   Get behind it from the beginning and make it an exciting
     priority.

     Deliver Quality not Quantity
07   The goal is to serve the guests and ensure they have a
     positive experience.

     Identify your barriers to excellent service
08   during training
     Speak to staff and work with them to work out barriers.
     Use white boards or other brainstorming techniques to
     discover what you will need to ensure tourists have a good
     experience.

     Measure Results
09   Usually, improvements will be observed immediately
     following the training. Your employees and the work
     environment should appear more positive. The true test
     of results is the level of staying power of the training
     implemented.

     Create a Process Improvement Team
10   Acquire a volunteer or assign a staff member to handle the
     follow-up of issues addressed in the training. Management
     will work with these team members.

     Include Customer Service Training
11   in the preparation of the eclipse
     Equip and empower employees with the skills and values
     for the eclipse. By establishing them from the start you
     align them with other trained staff and clearly indicate to
     them what your expectations are.

     Reward and Recognition
12   Acknowledge your returns on a when it is all over. Staff
     want and deserve to know that they are doing well and
     also that they are worthy of your investment and celebrate
     when it is over!

Elements of a Good Training Program
 Whether you design your own or adopt a proven outside
 provider, a training program meant to improve your service
 standards should include some of the following characteristics:

 ► Behavior changing activities

 ► Service standards that are customized for your own
    organization and work environment

 ► Specific modules for managers that may include leadership,
    standards development, etc.

 ► Interactive and enjoyable

 ► Enthusiastic presentation

 ► Skills building

 ► Relevant comparisons to the current service experience




 Presentation: What you say is important. How you say it is
 equally as important.

 A strong presentation usually contains the following:

 ► Dynamic start and throughout

 ► Animated, enthusiastic presentation

 ► Leadership skills

 ► Passions for excellent service

 ► Knowledge of organization’s vision

 ► Role-playing exercises

 ► Visual aids

 ► Break-out group activity




                                  9     Customer Service Handbook
Customer Service Standards
► Communication
The following are good tips that help provide acceptable service
levels in the area of telephone/voice mail and inquiry. They pertain
to any small business as well as home-based operations.

 Voice Mail/Telephone
Telephones should be answered as promptly as possible. Try to set a
specific number of rings, and make it your goal to answer before the
4th ring, for example.

All employees or family members should be trained to answer the
phone properly. If there are children answering the business phone,
they should be able to give the minimum key information.

Answer all calls in a courteous manner. A scripted consistent
greeting works well and sounds professional. An example would be,
“Good morning, West Orchard, Susan speaking. How can I help
you?’

During business hours, a person should be answering the main
number instead of having voice mail or an automated message.

Staff should listen, understand, and acknowledge the nature of the
request before transferring any calls.

Where possible, give the client the option to go to voice mail or
leave a message verbally.

All staff and management should adhere to a policy that sets
timelines to returning calls and responding to enquiries. Same day is
recommended.

All outgoing voice mail (recorded greeting) messages should be
brief, current and accurate. An example would be: “Hello, You have
reached Cass at Eclipse Gurus. I’m out of the office until June1st. Please
leave a message and I will return your call as soon as possible”

A good outgoing voice mail message will contain the person’s name,
department, telephone numbers and time available.




                                    10      Customer Service Handbook
Outgoing voicemail messages should have an optional number
or extension to call for urgent enquiries. This could be especially
important in the case of relatives trying to contact guests of a hotel,
or someone who wants to purchase your services immediately.

Learn how to prioritize your daily messages and enquiries. Answer
the most important ones first.

If a caller is on hold, be aware of the length of time and set a
standard for this. It is acceptable to take that person’s number and
call him back if you are multi-tasking at that time.

When leaving town or being away from your business, change your
voicemail to provide that information so that your potential clients
are informed.
                                                                          © Christian Kimber




                                   11     Customer Service Handbook
 Written Correspondence - E-Mails, Facebook messages
The exchange of information comes in many forms. To respond
accurately and timely is key. The inconvenience of repeating or re-
sending information or unreasonable waiting time can be interpreted
as poor service.

Any written communication should be reviewed before you send it
out by email, fax or social media messages. To send incomplete or
incorrect information causes delays and could cost you time and
money. CREATE A WRITTEN CANCELLATION POLICY!

All responses should be timely. For e-mails, within 24 hours is
acceptable but the same day is best.

All correspondence should contain a “signature block” that includes
company name, person’s name, complete address, telephone
number, and e-mail address.

 In Person
Make your first impression a positive one.

A timely, courteous acknowledgment including eye contact gives a
good first impression, especially if the staff person is on the phone
or engaged with another guest.

If you are busy with a guest and the phone rings, or something takes
you away from serving the guest, excuse yourself and then address
the new situation. To all tourists efficiently - take a message, phone
the person back or delegate the new enquiry to a staff member and
then return to the initial conversation with the first guest.

If a station is not staffed, such as the front desk of a hotel, have the
hours posted at that station as to when a person will be there and/or
leave instructions as to where the person could find immediate help.

Customer Service Standards
► Housekeeping
Always a constant concern! Cleanliness and tidiness are first
foremost in the eye of the beholder. A customer’s first impression is
always visual.

 Building and Public Amenities
Properly maintained facilities, which are sanitary, completely
operational, fully stocked and supplied, accessible and meet health
and safety standards is a key element to your customer’s impression
of your ability to provide continuous good customer service. Hours
of operation, timely and accurately posted information such as room
direction, menu specials, and special announcements, are also
good indicators of a well-managed business. Good housekeeping
can be over-emphasized. Your standards for cleanliness reflect your
commitment to showing your customers excellent service.

Avoid the following inappropriate housekeeping situations in your
food service areas:

 In the Restaurant
  Food Particles on the floor or on tables and chairs
  Unclean cutlery
  Dishes left on tables for too long
  Washrooms unattended
  Stained linen and napkins
  Dirty Floors
  Carpet Odor
  Cluttered and untidy workstations
  Stained and unclean glassware
  Stains on the wall
  Dust on the ceiling, lights and fans
  Dirty and food splattered menus

Customer Service Standards
► Restaurant/Dining Room
Below are common problems and solutions to situations that occur
in the food and beverage environment.

 Speed of service
Don’t be afraid to inform customers at your table if things are taking
longer than expected. They will appreciate being kept informed on
the status of their order.

 Professional appearance
Make sure your uniform/clothing/shirt is clean and you are properly
groomed. Your appearance contributes to the first impression the
customers makes about your establishment. Chewing gum or eating
in front of guests is not professional.

 Quality checks
Pay attention to the body language and facial expressions of your
guests. You can tell if something is wrong right away. Visit the
table after you have delivered the meals as this will give you an
opportunity to correct any problems before it is too late.

 Mistakes
If you get the order mixed up, or something is incorrect with the
meal, don’t be afraid to recognize the error and inform the guest that
you will fix it immediately. Forgive yourself!

 Customer focus
Rather than gathering at the staff table or staff area in the dining
room, focus on making trips to your customers’ tables to be visible
and available to serve your customers as needed.




                                  14      Customer Service Handbook
 Appropriate discussion
Limit your conversation with your coworkers to work-related subjects
and use professional language and a proper voice level. Guests
do not want to hear the latest gossip or what’s going on in your
personal life.

 Hide your frustration
Sometimes things can be hectic. When there are problems behind
the scenes, keep them quiet and don’t let your customers see your
frustration.

 Workplace issues
It is not appropriate to discuss work-related problems or issue with
your guests. Direct your concerns to the management or ownership
and give them the chance to solve your problem.

 Closing time
Don’t rush the guest but rather continue with your responsibilities.
The guest can usually tell when it is time to finish up and pay
their bill.


These customer service
standards are key to ensure a
positive image for Arkansas.                                           © Hans G. Pfaff

Customer Service Tips
► for Everyone
Good customer relations can leave a lasting positive impression
that leads to increased return business by word of mouth. The
following are ways to ensure customer satisfaction and prevent
disappointment:

  ► Follow-up on all enquiries and sales opportunities efficiently.

  ► Advertise only what you can guarantee to deliver. Be realistic.

  ► Inform guest of any changes to agreement as soon as possible.

  ► Confirm all details of contract or service prior to start date. This
     will prevent confusion and disappointment of something that
     was expected but not delivered.

  ► Have handy checklists ready and refer to them prior to activity
     to eliminate oversights.

  ► Make sure your communication system, schedule and
     equipment are failsafe as some systems may not be
     working.

  ► Be on time.

  ► Welcome you tourists in a professional and confident manner.

  ► Be aware and follow all licensing and legislative guidelines.

  ► Share knowledge in the areas of culture, history, land and other
     pertinent information as possible.

The Hallmarks of Hospitality
Customer service is the pillar for success in almost every business.
The relationship between the supplier, the product and the
consumer require dedication to this ideal every step of the way.
Include the following elements of customer service in your day-to-
day interactions.

 Acknowledgement
This is the first step for creating respect and confidence between
the you and the guest. It’s as simple as making eye contact,
smiling and taking time to speak to a guest. This primary focus
goes a long way.

 Recognition
Make your customers feel welcome and important by remembering
their name, and referring to them in a professional and appropriate
manner. (even though you may be too busy)

 Anticipation
Impress your guest by staying on top of their needs before they have
to ask you for them.

 Flexibility
Be prepared with alternative options to guests’ requests. Sometimes
thinking outside the box is required to manage your guests’ needs
to solve problems.

 Knowledge
Ensure you have the information required to complete the goals of
the job. Missing pieces of the puzzle can cause delays and other
problems contributing to an inferior service experience.




                                 17      Customer Service Handbook
 Skills
Along with knowledge, skills are developed through eclipse training,
and utilized in the ongoing customer service process.

 Listening
Have a “guest first” focus. Give the tourist your total attention to
make them feel valued.

 Recovery
Mistakes are bound to occur; how you deal with them is important.
Empower and train staff to handle negative situations. Remember
that the worst of situations can have a positive outcome if handled
properly.




                                                                       © Lee Narraway
