Introduction:


        Heightened customer conflicts can happen frequently, especially
        in dynamic, busy, and fast-paced consumer-serving businesses.
        Sometimes customers are going to be angry, it’s just the price of
        doing business for a lot of companies. And dealing with angry
        customers can lead to elevated stress for customer service agents
        and, if poorly handled, diminished brand loyalty. There is good
        news, though: you can turn escalated conflicts around.

        In fact, sometimes a corrective experience for an upset customer
        can lead to them becoming one of your more loyal patrons.
        There’s a fine line here, though, so taking the right steps to de-
        escalating conflict is critically important. This short book is a brief
        8-step guide to understanding and implementing de-escalation
        skills for customer service interactions. However, the techniques
        discussed here are applicable in a variety of escalated situations,
        whether it be with customers, eventgoers, coworkers, or friends
        and family members.

        Whether you’re a manager tasked with keeping the peace in
        elevated customer interactions or one of the many customer-
        facing team members who face conflict on a regular basis,
        following these steps can lead to quicker resolutions and better
        overall customer experiences.

Step 1        Stay Calm

  The most professional way to handle an upset customer is to refrain from getting upset
  yourself. This can be a challenging task, especially if the customer is highly dysregulated
  and insults start to become personal.

  Nonetheless, remaining calm is the best way to meet your frustrated customer where they
  are without escalating the situation. But staying calm isn’t always easy to do. Here are
  some tips for remaining calm in these moments:

     Breathe: It may sound silly but slowing yourself down to take a few deep breaths can
     make all the difference in how you respond.
     Take some physical space: If the angry customer is in-person and enters your personal
     space, take a few steps back. You won’t be successful in remaining calm if you feel
     physically threatened or intimidated, so give yourself some room.
     Notice your own emotions: Recognize what you’re feeling in the moment. You don’t
     necessarily need to act on it but naming or acknowledging fear, anxiety, or frustration
     can help quell the overwhelm of these emotions so they don’t start speaking on your
     behalf.
     Call in an alternative: If you’re the manager, it’s probably your job to de-escalate
     customers. But if you’re able to get a colleague to sub for you temporarily while you
     collect yourself, it could help in the long run. This should be someone who hasn’t been
     trying to manage this conflict since it began; that way, s/he might be just far enough
     away from the matter that they don’t get overwhelmed by it. So take a few minutes and
     come back with some fresh ideas.




                                                        https://pollackpeacebuilding.com 04
Step 2        Validate Your Customer

  Whether or not you agree with an agitated customer isn’t really important at this stage.
  When people get emotionally escalated, they’re not usually in a place to use reason and
  logic. So, trying to use reason to let them know what they might have done wrong or what
  you are going to do to solve the issue is unlikely to help. They first just need to be heard.
  When people don’t feel heard, they don’t feel cared about, and this leads to emotional
  escalation. Customers get angry and upset most often because they're coming to a
  customer-facing representative with their problem, but it seems like the rep doesn't really
  care. So, we really need to help them feel listened to and cared for.

  Imagine if you had an issue with a product or service that was stressing you out because it
  was affecting your life in some greater way, as is usually the case with customers who are
  upset. A web server customer can’t get her website to work, which affects his ability to do
  business; an appliance customer didn’t receive his new refrigerator on time and now has no
  way to keep his family’s food from rotting over the weekend; a bank customer can’t
  withdraw money from her account, which literally affects everything in her life. And they go
  to the customer service agent with their issue, but the agent responds very robotically,
  without much compassion or empathy. Or maybe the agent gives a very weak apology but
  it’s obvious the agent doesn't really care about the greater or deeper stresses in their lives
  this issue is causing. How angry and frustrated would you feel? Many of us have had this
  experience, and it's the easiest way to escalate a situation.




                                                         https://pollackpeacebuilding.com 05
So, if a common source of customer escalation is a lack of perceived care, then we have to
help the customer feel that we DO care if we want to deescalate. One powerful way to
show we are listening and we care about a customer’s issue and the stress it's causing by
practicing reflective listening, or what we call Listen and Repeat.

The technique is simple: Whatever you hear from the customer, before responding or trying
to resolve the issue, first repeat back what you heard them say. This form of validation is an
incredibly powerful way to help someone feel heard and cared for, and it can immediately
help an individual calm down. In fact, studies have shown that empathic paraphrasing can
actually regulate negative emotions in someone else. And not only does repeating help the
customer feel heard, it also helps you ensure you've heard them correctly. It gives them a
chance to correct you if not.

Here’s what it might sound like from a customer service rep:

“So, you ordered with expedited shipping but it hasn't gotten to you yet, and now your
oven isn't functioning and you can't cook dinner for your kids.”

Or

“Oh wow, okay so your neighbor stays up all night and watches TV loudly, and you can
hear it through the walls.”

Again just repeat or paraphrase back what you heard before responding or jumping to
solutions. This helps validate the customer’s experience.




                                                       https://pollackpeacebuilding.com 06
Step 3         Don’t Take it Personally

   One of the quickest ways to escalate a situation
   further is for you to go into defense mode. But
   remember, the customer likely doesn’t know you
   personally, so anything they say personally is just
   their way of defending themself in that fight-or-
   flight mode. So, this really can’t be personal even
   though it may sound like they’re trying to make it
   personal. Your task — and it’s a tall one — is to stay
   above it.




Step 4       Avoid Arguing or
             Defending
  Despite all of your urges to argue, defend, and prove
  a wrong customer wrong, resist them. Fact-checking
  emotions is a surefire way to turn a small rupture into
  an all-out war. There’s no arguing against how
  someone feels. How they feel is how they feel, and
  it’s okay. It doesn’t mean you agree with their story or
  argument. Wait until they’ve calmed down a bit and
  can use that more rational thinking brain before you
  start introducing evidence or policies that contradict
  them.

  Be flexible, let go of being right, and work toward a
  collaborative solution rather than opposing them in
  order to make a point or prove that they’re wrong.

Step 5        Be Gentle

  Dialectical Behavior Therapy has a skill called GIVE. It stands for Gentle, Interested,
  Validate, Easy manner. As a skillset used to improve interpersonal effectiveness, GIVE is
  meant to serve as a reminder that it’s not just our words that can make or break an
  argument. It’s really how we deliver those words. It’s a simple concept made simpler if you
  consider how you prefer to be spoken to, especially when you’re upset.

  By being gentle and using an easy manner, you’re being mindful of your tone of voice, body
  language, and vocabulary. Instead of hurling back curse words at a frustrated customer,
  posturing toward them to assert your authority, or using a short or robotic tone, try being
  more open, friendly, empathetic, and kind. Try to mirror their emotions in an appropriate
  way, so they feel you’re in this with them rather than looking at and judging them from the
  outside.




                                                        https://pollackpeacebuilding.com 08
Step 6         Be Assertive

  Validating emotions is important and should be one of the first steps in de-escalating an
  upset customer. However, setting some boundaries is also important for your well-being.
  This means not letting the customer just walk all over you in their rage. You can assert your
  boundaries as a company representative and as a human being.

  Note the difference between being assertive and aggressive. You don’t have to be
  intimidating in your boundary-setting. You can simply be confident and humble, staying
  centered in your space. You can also think of this as being kind but firm. You can use
  compassion as a means to set expectations.



Step 7         Take Responsibility Where You Can

  Whether or not an apology is in order, it’s a worthwhile approach to take responsibility for
  whatever you feel is appropriate. Chances are that the company was responsible for some
  part of the ordeal, even if it was just poor communication, unclear expectations, or a
  problem with the product or service. Apologize where an apology is due, and don’t let your
  pride stand in the way of making amends. Put yourself in the customer’s shoes. Think about
  what you would like to hear if you were them. After all, we are all customers of some sort to
  various brands. So, what responsibility do you want companies to take when you have a
  problem with them?

  Taking responsibility isn’t only about owning
  up to where you or the company may have
  contributed to the problem but also how
  you’re going to manage the solution. Let your
  customer put faith in the fact that you’re on it,
  you’re in this with them, and you will handle it
  or get them to the person that can. This way,
  they won’t feel so alone in the problem.




                                                         https://pollackpeacebuilding.com 09
Step 8         Focus on a Solution

 Now, notice how the solution is actually the last part of this process. That’s because an
 escalated person — whether it’s a customer, coworker, friend, or family member — needs
 to feel listened to and validated, so they can calm down, before they’ll be ready to get to a
 solution. Once they have calmed a bit, it’s time to work as collaboratively as possible with a
 customer to determine the right solution.

 Solution building should involve the customer as much as possible. So, can you bring them
 into co-creating the solution? Or if you have a solution in mind, can you present it as a
 suggestion and ask them if that would work for them? In other words, instead of simply
 telling them what you’re going to do, you ask them their opinion as well, so they feel they
 have some agency or control over the process, which is incredibly important for escalated
 conflict resolution.

 Believe it or not, when you navigate a customer conflict effectively; if you stay calm,
 validate the customer, take some responsibility, and get them to feel they’ve co-developed
 an agreeable solution, that conflict can be transformed into an amazing opportunity to gain
 even more customer trust and even longer customer loyalty.

                             Bonus Tip #1
Using Empathy & Apologies
Empathy is not just a feeling you have, it's a feeling that you clearly express behaviorally
through tone and body language. If you're face-to-face with an escalated individual, then
your facial expression and even hand gestures should contain emotionality. And whether
face-to-face or not, your vocal tone should contain emotion. This let's someone know you're
there with them, in the issue, not simply an outsider looking in. Empathy helps people feel
like they have a partner or a teammate, rather than feeling so alone in their problem.

And with customers specifically, apologies go a long way. But they need to be authentic,
even heartfelt. Apologize for what they are experiencing and going through, or apologize
for anything you can take responsibility for on behalf of the company. Just don’t apologize
for someone’s feelings, as that can sound condescending.

It might sounds like this:

“So, you ordered with expedited shipping but it hasn't gotten to you yet, and now your
oven isn't functioning and you can't cook dinner for your kids. Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry
this is happening. I really apologize for this delay. I can only imagine how stressful this
is.”

Or

“Oh wow, okay so your neighbor stays up all night and watches TV loudly, and you can
hear it through the walls. Ugh, this is so frustrating. You must be exhausted. I'm so
sorry.”

Using tones and words that express emotions relating to stress, frustration, or aggravation
can again really help the individual feel heard and understood.

By now, feeling heard and cared for, most customers should feel at least a bit calmer and
more ready to find a solution.




                                                       https://pollackpeacebuilding.com 11
                           Bonus Tip #2
Customer Reassurance
When you are trying to de-escalate a situation, you want to reassure the escalated
individual that you are in this with them, that they're not alone, and you're not leaving until
you can solve this issue or find someone who can. For example:

“Okay Jane, I'm going to stay on with you until we find a solution that works. Can we
take a look at your account?”

Or

“Okay Tom, I'm not in the right department to get this taken care of, but I'm going to
stay on with you until we reach someone in the right department. I'm not going
anywhere.”

Or

“Dan, how about if I go talk to your neighbor and see if I can help. And I will get back to
you by 3pm whether I reach him or not to give you an update. Does that sound like a
good first step?”

Remember, to get to problem-solving, we first have to de escalate. And that means helping
someone shift out of their fight or flight fear centers and back into their problem solving
brain regions. We can do this by helping them feel safe, respected, and, for customers
especially, that we care about their problem and deeper life stresses it's causing. Care is the
key to de-escalating customers!

team member, then these types of skills will be crucial. Of course, if you need assistance
