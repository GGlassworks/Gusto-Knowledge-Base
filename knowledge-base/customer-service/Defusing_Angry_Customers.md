                    Customer Satisfaction
                    Customer Complaints

               Customer Satisfaction
       Our job is to be polite,
                     get past their anger,
                                    and solve the problem.

       Verbal de‐escalation skills can help us do that.

           Speak when you are angry and you will make
              the best speech you will ever regret.
                                  ‐‐Ambrose Bierce

 Make a list of calming thoughts to replace hot ones:

  I expect people to be upset when they believe they
   have been treated badly.
  I am here to help. I can’t do that if I’m upset.
