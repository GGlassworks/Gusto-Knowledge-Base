TOOLS REQUIRED




INSPECT AND PREPARE THE PRODUCT FOR INSTALLATION

1.   Inspect the window product thoroughly before beginning installation.

     •    Conﬁrm the window matches the size needed for the opening; measuring 1/2” smaller than the rough opening
          dimensions in width and height.

     •    Conﬁrm the window’s features match the requirements of the project, order, and opening; e.g., Low-E, color,
          code, rating, operating direction, egress.

     •    Conﬁrm there is no damage to the product and that all necessary pieces are in place for a complete installation;
          e.g., locks, labels, weather stripping.

          Do not proceed with installation if there are any concerns about the condition or suitability of the product for
          installation or compliance with project, order, code, or opening requirements.

2.   Keep the jambs plumb and square with the head and sill on the window throughout installation. Keep sashes
     closed and locked throughout installation. Avoid “crown up” or “bow down” conditions at both sill and head. Avoid
     “bowed out” installations by conﬁrming equal jamb widths throughout installation, especially at meeting rails.
REMOVING THE EXISTING WINDOW

1.   Remove any existing interior stops or trim from the window unit.
2.   Cut around the exterior and interior of the existing window unit. This will free the window from any sealed joints.
     Be careful not to damage any exterior ﬁnish. See Figure A.
3.   Remove all existing installation screws to free the window from the opening. See Figure B.
4.   Carefully remove the window unit, being careful not to damage any exterior ﬁnish or weather barriers.
5.   Inspect and clean the opening and remove any shims or installation screws. Replace any existing weather barrier
     material that may have been damaged in the removal process with the appropriate code-compliant material.
     See Figure C.




INSPECT AND PREPARE THE ROUGH OPENING

1.   Make sure the rough opening is in good condition and sits plumb, level, and square.
     See Figure D. Conﬁrming measures should not exceed permissive tolerances in
     ASTM 2112: 1/8” nominal square tolerance for units less than 20 sq. ft. or 1/4” for units
     more than 20 sq. ft. Framing conditions at the rough opening must be sufﬁcient to
     support the window unit, framing header above, and permit appropriate integration
     of the window into the building’s water management system. Rough openings
     should be 1/2” larger than window frame in width and height.
2.   If the building already has a weather resistant barrier (WRB) installed, it is necessary
     to prepare an opening in the WRB to accept the window. Milgard recommends that
     the installer follow the WRB manufacturer’s recommendation to prepare the
     opening.
FLANGE (Z-BAR) INSTALL RECOMMENDATIONS:
(SKIP TO NEXT SECTION FOR FINLESS INSTALLATION)

Installation into Wood Buck Frame (Outside-In Method)
1.   After assessing and preparing the opening, installing any accessories, and dry ﬁtting the window, the replacement of the
     new window can begin.

     •   Apply a liberal bead of sealant around the back side of the ﬂange at the head and jambs. Place a bead of sealant
         across the sill except for small gap(s) near the center of the ﬂange. See Figure E. Note: do not seal over ventilation
         holes of Z-bar ﬂange. For proper adhesion, ensure there is full backing support on the wall where the back of the
         ﬂange makes contact. Where wet sealant is used, a small amount of "squeeze out" is favorable to indicate a
         continuous seal. Any "squeeze-out" should be promptly troweled smooth.

2.   Position the window into the opening. Determine if any wood shims are needed to keep the window plumb, square, and
     centered in the opening. See Figure F.

     •   Correctly shimming the new window unit plays a critical role in the operation of the window unit.

     •   Do not over or under shim. Either can cause distortion of the frame.

     •   Shims should be positioned so the window does not vary more than 1/16” from being level.

     •   “Lateral” Shims are often placed between the side jambs and the frame to square the window.

     •   Shims used to establish spacing at anchor points must be penetrated by the anchor. They are trimmed as needed but
         not removed. Install window with FULL support under the entire width of the sill.

3.   For ﬂange (z-bar) and ﬁnless window units, drill holes and install fasteners as shown in the Milgard Fastener Schedule:
     https://www.milgard.com/technical-resources

     Note: When installing screws, do not over tighten them as it will pull the frame out-of-line. Tighten screws just snug
     against the vinyl.

4.   Adjustments may have to be made several times until satisfactory performance is achieved.

5.   In extreme cases, the old window opening might be badly “bowed.” If the adjustments do not solve this problem, wood
     shims will have to be used between the rough opening and the replacement window jambs.
FINLESS INSTALLATION WITHIN WOOD BUCK

Stop Application:
1.   For inside-out block frame replacements, install stops on the exterior of the
     wood buck at the sides and head. The stops provide a surface for sealant and
     create a solid mounting surface the new window unit can be pressed
     against. See Figure G.

2.   The stops are usually made of ½” strips of ¾” wood, ½” quarter round
     molding, or a similar material.

3.   Make sure when choosing stops that they do not impede in the operation of
     the window unit.

4.   Install the stops approximately ½” from the outer edge of the wood buck on
     all four sides.

5.   Apply a liberal bead around the back side of the window at the head and
     jambs. Place a bead of sealant across the sill except for small gap(s) near the
     center. For proper adhesion, ensure there is full backing support on the wall
     where the back of the window makes contact.

6.   Follow steps 2 through 5, under the ﬂange installation recommendations
     listed above.

7.   Place a bead of sealant around the exterior perimeter of the stops, making
     sure the exterior of the stops are sealed to the window condition. Then
     complete exterior ﬁnish per project.

8.   Place a bead of sealant around the interior of the window. Then complete
     interior ﬁnish as required.


CONSIDERATIONS AND CAUTIONS

Important Cautions
•    Use of solvents or acids may damage components of this product and will
     limit rights under the warranty.

•    Stage and store window products with caution. Do not store in the sun or
     lay ﬂat before or during installation.

•    Care must be taken to ensure material compatibility of the window unit and surrounding
     building conditions. Where necessary, steps should be taken to isolate the window from
     reactionary building elements.

Post-Installation Reminders
•    With the exception of logo and NFRC labels, all Milgard applied labels should remain in
     place and not be removed after installation is complete (e.g., AAMA labels, warranty
     labels, warning labels).

•    Milgard recommends a yearly inspection of its products and the surrounding materials,
     inside and outside the home. Upkeep of sealant joints, hardware and weather stripping
     can ensure longevity and proper functioning of the window products.
