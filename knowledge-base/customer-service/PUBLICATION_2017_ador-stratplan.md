 For our FY 2018-2022 plan, ADOR has adopted strategic goals to close the gap                                                 Customers
 between the reality of our current challenges and future state vision (see Figure
 2.) The number of goals, as shown on page 10, and their simplicity bring clarity to
 every aspect of the agency’s work. Every ADOR employee should understand how
 their day-to-day work aligns with the agency’s strategic goals and mission.

 In addition to the goals, ADOR has identified five strategies, also shown in page 10,      CURRENT                                                      AGENCY          FUTURE

 are to be developed as specific projects to resolve the challenges. The outcomes

           Deploy Arizona Management System

 Governor Doug Ducey’s vision is for Arizona to be the number one state to live,
 work, play, recreate, retire, visit, do business and get an education. To achieve this
 vision, Arizona state government is changing how it thinks and does business.

 For the first time in its history, Arizona government is operating as one cohesive
 enterprise within a professional, results-driven management system. Based on
 principles of Lean management, it is a system that focuses on reducing waste from
 business processes while continuously improving our ability to deliver customer
 value and vital mission outcomes for citizens.

 Within the Arizona Management System, every employee at the Arizona

 measures achieved, as reflected in agency scorecards, are now the benchmark by
 which we monitor progress. Employee performance in day-to-day work contributes
 directly to what the agency tracks on our scorecard. Through the cascading of the
 scorecards, employees can see the connection between their own performance,
 the agency’s overall progress, and the governor’s most important goals.

 To be successful, every employee at every level must understand that collectively
 and individually, our job is to do more good for Arizona. To do this, we all must
