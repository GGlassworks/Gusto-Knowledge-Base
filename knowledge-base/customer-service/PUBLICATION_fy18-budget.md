Agency:          RVA    Department of Revenue


Fund:            1520   DOR Unclaimed Property Fund

Justification:          Receipts for unclaimed property are liabilities owed or due to the owners of the unclaimed property with no expiration date or statute of limitations. Since receipts from sale of
                        properties are not true revenues, the activity of the fund does not exist in AFIS. Due to this issue, the transfer to RVA DOR Administrative Fund causes a negative fund balance.
                        For this purpose, the fund reflects a revenue receipt to offset the transfer.

                        For a distribution list of how the disbusements are distributed, see A.RS. § 44-313.

                        The following is the breakout of the "Non-Appropriated Disbursements" category for FY 2016:
                        Refunds to Owners of Unclaimed Property: $54,884.2
                        SMI Housing Trust Fund $2,000.0
                        Housing Trust Fund $2,511.1
                        Transfer to RVA DOR Administrative Fund $24,500.0
                        Transfer to General Fund $65,996.2
                        Transfer to various other funds $1,007.8

         Justification:
          Fund Description

           Source:             This is a holding fund for the Transaction Privilege Tax. There are timing issues with AFIS as to when cash is
                               cleared. This fund is a clearing account.
           Use:                This fund is distributed to the state, counties, and cities (for revenue sharing) and program cities for sales tax. For
                               the most part, all funds deposited to this account are distributed by the fiscal year end.
           OSPB:               This fund receives revenues from collected monies associated with excise and transportation privilege (sales) tax.

          Fund Justification

         Justification:  "Receipts" for Unclaimed Property are actually liabilities owed or due to owners of the unclaimed property with
                         no expiration date or statute of limitations.
          Fund Description

                               a period of time. Arizona law requires the entities to remit the unclaimed funds to the Department.
                               Receipts for Unclaimed Property are actually owed or due to owners of the unclaimed property with no expiration
                               date or statute of limitations.

         Justification:
          Fund Description

           Source:             The funding source is from payments received for income tax liabilities. There are timing issues with AFIS as to
                               when cash is cleared. This fund is a clearing account.
           Use:                This fund is established for the purpose of issuing refunds. Residual revenue is cleared to the general fund at
                               fiscal year end.
           OSPB:               Revenues in the fund are transfers in from the State General Fund and are used to provide income tax refunds.

                               pursuant to contracts authorized is deposited in the special collections account. The department shall pay from
                               the account all fees and court costs provided for in the contracts authorized. Revenues are cleared to the state

                               subsection B, paragraph 3 of this section. The department shall allocate the remainder of the amounts collected
                               under subsection B, paragraph 3 of this section to the state or the political subdivision in the proportion that the
                               monies would have been distributed pursuant to chapter 5 of this title or section 43-206, respectively.

         Justification:
          Fund Description

           Source:             These receipts are not revenues, but liabilities "Due to Others," similar to the Estate and Unclaimed Property
                               Fund number 1520. There are timing issues with AFIS of when receipts are cleared. All receipts in a given fiscal
                               year are allocated back to claimants and the permanent school land fund.
           Use:                The prior year's receipts are deposited the following year to the Permanent School Fund.
           OSPB:               This fund consists of monies from the sale of escheated estates. Property escheats or reverts to the state, after 5
                               years when there is no will to transmit the property and there are no legal heirs to inherit it. The Fund is used as
                               repository for proceeds from the sale of escheated property and hold them in the fund for 12 months, from which
                               payment of claims may be made, before being transferred to the Permanent State School Fund.

IRS Safeguard and OAG Technology Audit Findings
on Infrastructure and Cybersecurity

ADOR relies on federal tax information provided by The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
in many of its functions including the fraud refund prevention and individual income
audit programs. Federal tax information is also used for withholding, corporate income
tax, transaction privilege tax and other audit programs to determine taxpayer income.

The IRS and the Office of Auditor General (OAG) conducted three ADOR audits in
FY 2015-16.

Data Center Facilities

ADOR Data Center facilities are at a high risk/probability of a catastrophic failure
potentially impairing or stopping altogether the department’s tax collection and
distribution operations, severely disrupting the cash flow of the state and local
governments and the public services they provide. The facilities are outdated, no
longer supported by the manufacturer, reside in inadequate/aging facilities that are
not designed to host data-center equipment, and lack disaster recovery required to
ensure zero service interruption. The Data Centers continue to rapidly deteriorate
and require costly/inefficient maintenance.

Solution: Intelligent Printing System

An intelligent print and fax solution will also be implemented to improve the
protection of taxpayer information when they are transmitted for print, fax or email.
This will eliminate the out-of-support, non-integrated, old technology hardware
found in the SWOT analysis and the findings from the IRS and OAG.

                                                             The Department of Revenue’s origins predate Arizona statehood. The State Tax

                                                             law that had established the commission and transferred its powers and duties

 For our FY 2018-2022 plan, ADOR has adopted strategic goals to close the gap                                                 Customers
 between the reality of our current challenges and future state vision (see Figure
 2.) The number of goals, as shown on page 10, and their simplicity bring clarity to
 every aspect of the agency’s work. Every ADOR employee should understand how
 their day-to-day work aligns with the agency’s strategic goals and mission.

 In addition to the goals, ADOR has identified five strategies, also shown in page 10,      CURRENT                                                      AGENCY          FUTURE

 to help overcome challenges that could keep us from closing the gap. The strategies
 are to be developed as specific projects to resolve the challenges. The outcomes

           Deploy Arizona Management System

 Governor Doug Ducey’s vision is for Arizona to be the number one state to live,
 work, play, recreate, retire, visit, do business and get an education. To achieve this
 vision, Arizona state government is changing how it thinks and does business.

 For the first time in its history, Arizona government is operating as one cohesive
 enterprise within a professional, results-driven management system. Based on
 principles of Lean management, it is a system that focuses on reducing waste from
 business processes while continuously improving our ability to deliver customer
 value and vital mission outcomes for citizens.

 measures achieved, as reflected in agency scorecards, are now the benchmark by

 directly to what the agency tracks on our scorecard. Through the cascading of the
 scorecards, employees can see the connection between their own performance,
 the agency’s overall progress, and the governor’s most important goals.

 To be successful, every employee at every level must understand that collectively
