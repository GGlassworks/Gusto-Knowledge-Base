   Governor, State of Arizona
   1700 West Washington Street

   Dear Governor Ducey:

   Please find enclosed one original and one copy of the Arizona Department of Revenue's Executive Budget
   Request for fiscal year (FY) 2022, submitted in accordance with A.R.S. § 35-113.

   The enclosed continuation budget request supports ADOR's mission and the following strategic goals:
       • Optimize Employee Culture
       • Maximize Agency Effectiveness and Efficiency
       • Enhance Services and Automation
       • Legislative Agility

   We ask for your support with the following funding issue:
      • Permanent funding for the E-commerce Compliance and Outreach (ECCO) team that is instrumental
          in administering Arizona's remote seller laws. In FY 2020, the ECCO team helped deliver more than
          $128 million in General Fund revenue - 226% more than expected.

   Additionally, the Department continues planning for the replacement of its aged tax system, having recently
   completed a feasibility study that highlights the grave deficiencies of the current system and provides a
   framework for a replacement. We believe this will vastly improve the customer experience and increase
   voluntary compliance. We look forward to further engaging with your office to develop a proposal and
   funding model that works within a timeframe that best serves the needs of the state, cities and counties.

   Finally, ADOR has revamped its administrative rulings process that offers taxpayers opportunities to provide
   substantive feedback prior to the issuance of rulings. These changes fully implement Senate Bill 1347 from
   the 2020 regular legislative session and ADOR will continue to raise awareness of these changes.

   On behalf of the agency's Executive Leadership Team and all of our employees, thank you for your support
   of ADOR and this Executive Budget Request.

Issue Title: ​E-Commerce Compliance and Outreach (ECCO) Team                                                            Priority: #1



Background

On May 31, 2019, Governor Doug Ducey signed House Bill (H.B.) 2757 into law. This legislation requires those out-of-state retailers,
manufacturers and wholesalers that are remote sellers or marketplace facilitators to begin collecting, filing and paying transaction
privilege tax (TPT) in Arizona for the period beginning October 1, 2019. The law introduced a new economic (dollar-based) nexus
standard for businesses that do not have physical presence in Arizona, based on the following thresholds:

   ●   A ​remote seller has economic nexus if, in the previous year or current year, the gross receipts generated from direct sales of
       tangible personal property into Arizona are more than $200,000 in calendar year 2019, $150,000 in 2020 and $100,000 in
       2021 and beyond.

   ●   A ​marketplace facilitator has economic nexus if it facilitates, for remote seller(s) or its behalf, a gross amount of more than
       $100,000 in sales of tangible personal property into Arizona.

The legislation is the result of a 2018 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in ​South Dakota v. Wayfair​. The decision, one of the most
significant state and local taxation (SALT) rulings in decades, allows states to require out-of-state businesses lacking physical
presence to collect and remit tax on sales from transactions occurring in their state. With the enactment of H.B. 2757, Arizona joined
the ranks of dozens of states that have enacted remote seller/marketplace facilitator laws.

Within four months of approval by the legislature and executive, the Arizona Department of Revenue (ADOR) implemented Arizona’s
economic nexus laws, by completing the following non-exhaustive list of tasks:



                                                                                                                                Page 44
    ●   Develop, program and deploy - from both an agency and Information Technology (IT) standpoint - a separate and simplified
        TPT license application through ​AZTaxes.gov exclusively for remote sellers and marketplace facilitators to file and pay taxes
        through ​AZTaxes.gov​ and approved software vendors;

    ●   Develop, program and deploy reporting codes for exclusive use by remote sellers and marketplace facilitators that simplifies
        filing and payment of TPT and provides critical information enabling policy-makers and state budget offices to understand the
        impacts these sellers have on state and local tax revenue collections;

    ●   Identify, through market research, out-of-state remote sellers and marketplace facilitators that may meet the economic nexus
        thresholds described above to inform them of Arizona’s economic nexus law and help businesses meeting a threshold obtain
        the separate and simplified TPT license described above;

    ●   Identify and assist businesses that obtained a traditional TPT license between July 2018 and September 2019 that would
        qualify as a remote seller or marketplace facilitator under H.B. 27571, by converting their license to the remote
        seller/marketplace facilitator license and having them report under the remote seller/marketplace facilitator reporting codes;

    ●   Provide technical assistance to Arizona-based sellers of other states’ economic nexus laws, including eligibility thresholds,
        licensing, filing and paying requirements and out-of-state points of contact.

The results of ADOR’s rapid and innovative implementation of Arizona’s economic nexus laws are unambiguously successful -
particularly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has markedly shifted consumer retail purchasing activity to e-commerce
platforms - See Figure 1. Without passage of Arizona’s economic nexus law in 2019 and ADOR’s rapid and successful
implementation and administration - via the E-Commerce Compliance and Outreach (ECCO) team - state and local government
budgets would be in far worse shape than they have been.

 ​In the aftermath of the ​South Dakota v. Wayfair​ decision, many online sellers began obtaining TPT licenses without any direction from ADOR to do so, an
experience that occurred in many other states.
                                                                                                                                                        Page 45
Figure 1 - Economic Nexus General Fund Revenue Collections




During eight months of reporting activity, fiscal year (FY) 2020 General Fund revenue collections approached nearly $130 million,
more than doubling the $57 million anticipated in the FY20 budget. The highest collections month was June 2020, normally a
relatively slow month from a retail perspective, but the shift in consumer behavior amid the COVID-19 pandemic to online platforms
has been so pronounced that June 2020 collections exceeded that of January 2020, which is typically the highest month reflecting
Christmas/holiday shopping activity2.




2
  ​It should be noted that July 2020 collections (historically another relative slow retail month) also exceeded Christmas/Holiday sales reflected in January 2020
reporting.
                                                                                                                                                           Page 46
Over that same period, ADOR licensed more than 3,600 remote sellers and marketplace facilitators3, an amount on par with or
exceeding comparably-sized states like Washington, Maryland, Colorado, Indiana and South Carolina.

Critical to the success of ADOR’s implementation and administration of Arizona’s economic nexus laws was the establishment of the
ECCO team. This dedicated team of ADOR subject matter experts assist businesses and tax professionals with questions
concerning correspondence received from ADOR, remote seller and marketplace facilitator licensing, filing and payment assistance,
legal questions concerning physical and economic nexus, and assists Arizona-based businesses better understand and comply with
economic nexus laws of other states.

From late August through the end of FY20, the ECCO team performed the following non-exhaustive list of tasks:

      ●    Established a dedicated phone line (833-AZeSALE) and email address (​azesale@azdor.gov​);

      ●    Responded to more than 4,700 requests for technical assistance from out-of-state and Arizona-based businesses attempting
           to comply with Arizona or other states’ economic nexus laws, earning a satisfaction score of 100% among customer service
           survey respondents;

      ●    Conducted campaigns to identify and contact more than 7,300 out-of-state remote sellers and marketplace facilitators that
           may meet Arizona’s economic nexus thresholds - described above - to inform them of Arizona’s economic nexus law and help
           such businesses meeting a threshold obtain the separate and simplified TPT license described above;

      ●    Identified and assisted nearly 800 taxpayers who registered for a standard TPT license but qualified as a remote seller or
           marketplace facilitators, and converted them to a remote seller/marketplace facilitator license and provided accurate reporting
           codes;

      ●    Reached out to nearly 1,300 remote sellers or marketplace facilitators that had tax returns suspended for improper licensing,
           business codes and other reasons to help them correct the returns and provide education on how to file properly on an
           ongoing basis;

      ●    Issued a Request for Proposals to contract with a vendor to assist the ECCO team, on a contingency fee basis, in identifying
           unlicensed or under-reporting remote sellers and marketplace facilitators.4

1.         Description of issue and how recommending the agency’s request furthers the agency’s mandates:

           Funding for the ECCO team was initially provided through the $2 million in one-time monies appropriated5 to ADOR to
           implement Arizona’s economic nexus laws. ADOR’s FY21 budget proposal included a request for ongoing funding, which
           was included in the Executive and pre-pandemic budget plans from the majority caucuses of both legislative chambers. For
           reasons unrelated to the substance of the budget proposal,6 the requested funding was not ultimately included in the so-called
           “skinny budget for FY21”. This has required ADOR to absorb the costs of the ECCO team in FY21, reducing other efforts and
           initiatives in the agency to continue funding the ECCO team’s critical work.

           In FY21, FY22 and beyond the ECCO team’s responsibilities will be focused on the following activities:

               ●    Continuing to provide technical assistance and customer service to the ever-growing number of licensed remote
                    sellers and marketplace facilitators;

               ●    Conducting training sessions, in partnership with the Arizona Commerce Authority, to raise awareness of states’
                    remote seller laws among Arizona-based businesses and assisting Arizona based businesses complying with other
                    states’ laws, as appropriate;

               ●    Converting hundreds of remote sellers and marketplace facilitators that inadvertently registered under the traditional
                    TPT license to the proper remote seller/marketplace facilitator license;

               ●    Assisting taxpayers and their tax software vendors with suspended returns and errors in reporting and paying (e.g.
                    reporting and paying use tax on transactions, when TPT applies).

           Most critically, the ECCO team, with the support of a data analytics vendor contracted through the aforementioned RFP
           process, will identify and foster voluntary compliance among remote sellers and marketplace facilitators that meet Arizona’s
           reporting thresholds but have yet to license, as well as perform reviews of existing licensees to ensure that the amount and
           distribution among state and local governments is proper. This effort will be unique among states with remote seller laws in
           identifying unlicensed businesses and underreporting among existing licensees, as efforts to date have been mostly passive
           and lack analytical rigor. This activity is expected to accelerate increases in the number of licensed remote sellers and
           marketplace facilitators as well as grow state and local revenue from more robust licensing and reporting. The ECCO team

    ​ADOR reverted​ ​$649,700 from the out-of-state TPT administration special line item back to the Department of Revenue Administrative Fund in FY20.

 ​Similarly ​Senate Bill 1457​, a bill crafted by the Governor’s Office with ADOR’s technical assistance, passed out of the Senate with overwhelming support, but
was not taken up by the House as the session was truncated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
                                                                                                                                                           Page 48
     will continue to provide vital services to the remote sellers and marketplace facilitators that have been vital contributors to
     Arizona TPT revenues, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.


2.   Proposal:

     In order to realize and sustain the policy and fiscal objectives of Arizona’s economic nexus law, ADOR requests that the
     dedicated team described above be funded on an ongoing basis. ADOR’s E-Commerce Compliance and Outreach (ECCO)
     team, currently comprised of existing ADOR staff temporarily assigned to implement and administer H.B. 2757, is designed to
     serve two types of customers: 1) remote sellers and marketplace facilitators that may be subject to Arizona’s economic nexus
     law; 2) Arizona-based taxpayers that may be subject to sales taxes levied by jurisdictions outside Arizona through economic
     nexus laws.

     With respect to the first type of customers, the ECCO team is charged with performing the following tasks:

     Customer Support & Processing

                 ●   Answer phone calls and emails from remote sellers and marketplace facilitators through the dedicated phone
                     line and email address;
                 ●   Provide hands-on licensing assistance to taxpayers requiring additional help;
                 ●   Resolve out of balance and amended returns, conduct account examinations, respond to secure messages
                     and correspondence, monitor reports and assist taxpayers with reporting.

     Tax Research, Analysis and Appeals

        ●   Answer phone calls and written inquiries from businesses, individuals and taxpayer representatives regarding physical
            and economic nexus;
        ●   Respond to private taxpayer ruling requests;
        ●   Provide administrative appeals and litigation support, particularly in light of possible litigation in one or more states
            with respect to burdens placed on remote sellers ;
        ●   Create and modify administrative rules as necessary to administer H.B. 2757 and any subsequent legislation.




                                                                                                                                  Page 49
Education & Compliance

   ●   Perform outreach to remote sellers and marketplace facilitators to notify them of possible TPT licensing and reporting
       obligations;
   ●   Follow up with businesses that do not respond to ADOR notifications;
   ●   Processing voluntary disclosure agreement applications for taxpayers that come into compliance after the deadline to
       do so;
   ●   Manage a vendor that will help the department identify, on a contingency fee basis, remote sellers and marketplace
       facilitators that may be subject to Arizona’s economic nexus law;
   ●   Contact licensed remote sellers and marketplace facilitators to resolve missing returns and tax delinquencies;
   ●   Perform audits of remote sellers and marketplace facilitators;
   ●   Review and process requests for liability relief available to remote sellers and marketplace facilitators under certain
       circumstances.

Strategic Initiatives Affected

   Funding for the ECCO team fits squarely with the second overarching objective of ADOR’s Strategic Plan: ​Maximize
   Agency Effectiveness and Efficiency - Increase Voluntary Compliance​. ADOR strongly believes improving voluntary
   compliance among taxpayers is best achieved through education and technical assistance, electronic self-service options
   and advanced data analytics that allow ADOR to tailor interactions and solutions for taxpayers according to the highest
   probability of success. The ECCO team is a prime example of increasing voluntary compliance through all of these
   means and ongoing funding will support this strategic objective as well as ensure remote seller and marketplace facilitator
   revenues continue to grow in Arizona.



Performance Measures that will be used to evaluate the outcome:

   ●   The number of unlicensed businesses identified and brought into compliance through data analytics-driven outreach
       campaigns and new revenue obtained through these campaigns.
   ●   New revenue obtained from under-reporting of tax by remote sellers and marketplace facilitators identified through
       data analytics-driven outreach campaigns.
   ●   Number of technical assistance requests, including those from Arizona-based sellers, that were addressed by the
       ECCO team
   ●   Customer satisfaction score of ECCO technical assistance, as measured by a customer satisfaction survey.

                                                                                                                         Page 50
3.      Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:


        Before initiating this request, ADOR evaluated whether it could provide the services to remote sellers, marketplace facilitators
        and Arizona-based businesses described above by continuing to borrow the staff engaged in implementing and administering
        H.B. 2757 from their existing work units beyond the current fiscal year. Given the technical, administrative, and legal
        complexity of implementing and administering the most significant SALT reform in decades, ADOR found that attempting to
        provide the level of service H.B. 2757 requires while increasing the workloads of staff within existing work units and requiring
        them to manage within their operating budget and yet meet the high level of service expected by all other Arizona taxpayers
        of those units is both unsustainable and inadequate. To accomplish the State’s goals of H.B. 2757 and meet the expanded
        requirements of serving thousands of online businesses that heretofore had no Arizona TPT reporting obligations and
        providing Arizona-based businesses with information and outreach to help them comply with other jurisdictions’ economic
        nexus laws in a post-Wayfair economy, it is necessary to increase funding to obtain additional permanent resources to
        dedicate to this effort.




        ADOR evaluated three options for funding this request​::
          1) Seek permanent funding for the ECCO team from the General Fund;
          2) Continue to absorb the ECCO team’s costs in the base ADOR budget, as it is doing in FY21;
          3) Discontinue funding the ECCO team and disband it altogether



Why is the recommended option the best option?

     Option 1) is recommended.

     Option 1) is superior, as it recognizes that the administration of Arizona’s remote seller and marketplace facilitator laws is a
     unique and distinct undertaking that requires dedicated staff and funding. In most cases, remote sellers and marketplace
     facilitators licensing with ADOR have never had any interaction with Arizona’s tax authorities, sell solely online and with the
     outcome of ​South Dakota v. Wayfair​ are now having to license, collect, report and pay tax to every jurisdiction that has remote
     seller/marketplace facilitator laws, where previously they had virtually no responsibility to collect and remit in any jurisdiction. The
     ECCO team is unique among states in that it helps remote sellers navigate the post-​Wayfair​ world.



                                                                                                                                      Page 51
     Remote sellers and marketplace facilitators selling into Arizona must report their activities through unique business codes and
     deductions that are separate from Arizona’s traditional TPT retail classification and are able to obtain liability relief that is not
     otherwise available to in-state Arizona retailers. The ECCO team has had to go to great efforts to identify, contact and work with
     remote sellers and marketplace facilitators to get licensed, understand reporting requirements and address licensing and
     suspended returns issues as they arise. The responsibilities of the ECCO team will continue to grow in the coming years as more
     remote seller and marketplace facilitators meet Arizona’s reporting thresholds and the ECCO team, with the support of a data
     analytics vendor, pursue strategies to increase voluntary compliance through targeted non-filer and under-reporting outreach
     campaigns.

     Beyond properly tying expansive new tax administration responsibilities7 with funding sufficient to cover the costs of these new
     responsibilities, Option 1) is superior to Option 2) because the latter option detracts from ADOR’s ability to support existing
     Arizona taxpayers. The department has had to scale back other operations that provide direct support to Arizona taxpayers to
     provide services to a new set of customers.

4.       Impact of not funding this fiscal year:

Out of the 3 options, Option 3) was immediately rejected, as the ECCO team is critical to assisting remote sellers and marketplace
facilitators that generate significant TPT revenue for the state and local governments and will grow in importance as consumers
continue the inexorable shift to retail purchases to online platforms, an existing trend accelerated by the pandemic.

 ​In essence, it is like Arizona created a new tax type with brand new taxpayers and the relatively small ECCO team is the dedicated point of contact for a
customer base quite distinct from any other taxpayer in Arizona.                                                                                           Page 52

7.     Classifications of New Positions:

The Department is not requesting an increase in FTE’s, however we are only asking to provide funding for the 12 positions that the
Department currently has authority to fill. Along with those positions, there are other operating costs that will be needed to assist in
supporting this program to run efficiently.

Issue Title: Eliminate Veterans' Income Tax Settlement Funding and SLI                                     Priority: # 2


1.     Description of issue and how recommending the agency’s request furthers the agency’s mandates:

This fund consists of monies appropriated by the legislature and other monies donated accruing to the fund to pay claims made by
Native American veterans whose military pay improperly had state income tax withheld by the Department of Defense between 1993
and 2006.

Per Laws 2017, 53rd Legislature, First Regular Session, Chapter 215, HB 2158, Section 21B:

Any monies remaining in the fund after the payment of all valid claims by the Department revert to the state General Fund on June
30, 2021.

2.     Proposal:

       Revert all unexpended and unencumbered monies remaining in the fund on June 30, 2021 to the General Fund.

    The Honorable Douglas A. Ducey
    Governor, State of Arizona
    1700 West Washington Street
    Phoenix, Arizona 85007

    Dear Governor Ducey:

    RE: FY 2021 Supplemental: Other Fund Transfers to General Fund

    In an effort to mitigate the GF shortfall, the Arizona Department of Revenue is submitting a supplemental
    request for the transfer of other State Funds to the General fund. The Department has identified available
    dollars within the following funds that are eligible for transfer:

          •   Tobacco Tax and Health Care Fund
          •   IGA and ISA Fund RV2500

    Starting in Q4 FY 2020 and continuing into FY 2021, the Department has worked with the Governor's Office
    to identify fund balances that are available to be transferred to the General Fund in FY 2021. These fund
    transfers are possible because operating costs in Q4 FY 2020 were covered by the Coronavirus Relief Fund.
    Additionally, these fund transfers will have no negative impact on agency operations.

    The Arizona Department of Revenue recognizes that the Governor is focused on maintaining the fiscal
    integrity of the State's General Fund in light of the COVID-19 Public Health Pandemic. Further, the Governor
    is uniquely positioned to collaborate across all departments, identifying and crafting the best solution that is
    appropriate for each. The Arizona Department of Revenue looks forward to working with the Governor's
    Office on these solutions during the development of the FY 2022 Executive Budget.

    Director
