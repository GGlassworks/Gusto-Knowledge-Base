    September 1, 2022



    The Honorable Douglas A. Ducey
    Governor, State of Arizona
    1700 West Washington Street
    Phoenix, Arizona 85007

    Dear Governor Ducey:

    Please find enclosed one original and one copy of the Arizona Department of Revenue's Executive Budget Request
    for fiscal year (FY) 2024, submitted in accordance with A.R.S. § 35-113.

    The enclosed continuation budget request supports ADOR's mission and the following strategic goals:
        • Optimize Employee Culture
        • Maximize Agency Effectiveness and Efficiency
        • Enhance Customer Experience
        • Legislative
            Agility

    Additionally, ADOR is diligently implementing the 22 ADOR impacted bills from the 2022 regular legislative session,
    and will continue to raise awareness of these changes.

    We ask for your support with the following funding issues and concerns:

    1) Appropriation shift from the DOR Administrative Fund to the General Fund: Agency expenditure appropriations
    in the ADOR Administrative Fund (“ADOR Admin Fund”) exceed the mandated revenue of $24.5 Million by $4.1031
    Million due to increased cost obligations outlined below:

        •   10% Salary increase of $1.5 Million
        •   Healthcare cost increase of $1.2 Million
        •   HRIS and AFIS cost increase of $0.44 Million
        •   Increase in payroll costs due to insufficient appropriation increase on other ADOR funds of $.98 Million

    ADOR projects that we will run out of the fund balance in the ADOR Admin Fund to pay for expenses that have been
    appropriated in the FY23 Budget. ADOR is proposing a decrease in the ADOR Admin Fund appropriation of $4.1031
    Million and an increase in the General Fund appropriation by $4.1031 Million. This will enable ADOR to pay for the
    overall Agency appropriation to meet its obligations under A.R.S. § 42-1004.

    2) Salary Increase Reallocation: Per Laws 2022, 55th Legislature, 2nd Regular Session, Chapter 313, HB 2862 Section
    124 a ten percent salary increase for state employees beginning from and after July 8, 2022 was implemented. The
    Arizona Department of Revenue received $4.1803 Million. The budget requires all agencies receiving salary increases
    to transfer the monies in this line item to the relevant Programs, Subprograms and SLI’s where the salary increases
    will be utilized as part of the FY 2024 budget Request submission.

deposited in the fund accounts. Any unused monies at the end of the fiscal year revert to the fund.

          Fund Description

           OSPB:             Created in 2016, the Veterans' Income Tax Settlement Fund consists of legislative appropriations and is used to
                             pay claims made by Native American veterans whose military pay improperly had state income tax withheld by the
                             Department of Defense between 1993 and 2006. Any monies remaining in the fund after the payment of all valid
                             claims by the Department revert to the state General Fund on June 30, 2021.

                                                           FY 2024

Issue Title: Appropriation Shift from DOR Admin Fund to General Fund                                                 Priority: # 1

1.    Description of issue and how recommending the agency’s request furthers the agency’s mandates:

      Agency expenditure appropriations in the ADOR Administration Fund (“ADOR Admin Fund”) exceed the mandated revenue
      by $4.1031 million. Anticipated annual revenue equals $24.5 million, and yet the appropriated expenditure authority is $28.5
      million. The $24.5 million in revenue cannot be increased to match the appropriation of $28.603 million because this would
      require a legislative change, given that the ADOR Admin Fund is capped to a flat $24.5 million deposit per fiscal year from
      unclaimed property monies, pursuant to A.R.S. §§ 42-1116.01(A) and 44-313(A)(3). ADOR projects that we will run out of the
      fund balance in the ADOR Admin Fund to pay for expenses that have been appropriated in the FY23 Budget.

      The appropriation increase described above ($4.1031 million) is necessary to assist the agency in meeting increased cost
      obligations. However, the placement of the increased appropriation within the ADOR Admin Fund makes it structurally
      impossible for the agency to acquire the necessary funds to meet its ongoing cost obligations, given the above-described
      statutory limitations on the revenue that flows into the Admin Fund ($24.5 million). In FY23, the ADOR Admin Fund was
      burdened with a 10% salary increase of $1.5 million, health care cost increase of $1.2 million, and HRIS and AFIS cost
      increase of $0.44 million; the balance of approximately $0.98 million is for staff payroll for the positions necessary to meet
      statutory obligations of the agency. While those adjustments were made to the ADOR Admin Fund appropriation, moving
      them to the General Fund appropriation in future years would be a more sustainable configuration for the agency's funding
      structure.

      The ADOR Admin Fund helps ADOR administer and enforce the state’s tax code under A.R.S. § 42-1004. Further to this duty,
      A.R.S. § 42-1004(A) requires ADOR to: (a) formulate policies, plans, and programs that effectuate the agency's missions and
      purposes; (b) employ personnel and contract advisors, consultants, and aides necessary to the performance of its duties; and
      (c) assist other agencies of the state, local, tribal, and federal governments in furtherance of its purposes, objectives, and
      programs. Meeting payroll for the positions necessary to meet these statutory obligations of the agency would be a serious
      challenge, if the budget structural balance is left unaddressed.

                                                                                                                             Page 57
2.   Proposal:

     A decrease in the ADOR Admin Fund appropriation of $4,103.1 million and an increase in the General Fund appropriation by
     $4,103.1 million will enable ADOR to pay for the overall Agency appropriation to meet its obligations under A.R.S. § 42-1004.

3.   Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:

     Revenue of $24.5 million could be increased to match the expenditure appropriation of $28.603 million. However, this would
     require a change in legislation, given that the ADOR Admin Fund is established solely through a flat $24.5 million deposit per
     fiscal year from unclaimed property monies, pursuant to A.R.S. §§ 42-1116.01(A) and 44-313(A)(3)

4.   Impact of not funding this fiscal year:

     In FY22 ADOR collected and distributed $27.8B to the State, 91 cities and towns, 15 counties, and other entities. Not having
     the funds to pay for appropriated expenses jeopardizes the collection, administration, and distribution of billions of dollars.

5.   Statutory Reference:

     A.R.S. § 42-1004, ADOR's mandate is to administer and enforce the state's tax code, and is required to formulate policies,
     plans, and programs that effectuate the agency's missions and purposes.

       A ten percent salary increase for state employees beginning from and after July 8, 2022. The Arizona Department of Revenue
       received $4,180,300.

2.     Proposal:

       part of the FY 2024 budget request submittals. These submittals will include the reallocation for both FY 2023 and FY 2024.

lncome Tax lnformation Technology - General Fund Appropriation


In FY 2022, the Department of Revenue received $466,300 from the General Fund for lncome
Tax information Technology (lT) costs. This was a One-Time increase of $466,300 from the
General Fund in FY 2022 for one-time costs associated with Laws 2021, Chapter 425, which
created an optional entity-level income tax for partnerships and S Corporations. This increase
will allow DOR to make programming changes to the lT tax system to comply with Chapter 425.

This legislation created an optional entity-level income tax for partnerships and S-Corporations.
The funding increase allowed DOR to make programming changes to the IT tax system to
comply with Chapter 425.
In the Department’s FY 2024 Executive Budget Request submission, the BUDDIES software did
not allow for an estimation of expenditures for FY 2023 and FY 2024. This is due to the removal
of the one time appropriation. The General Appropriation Act footnote, the FY 2022
appropriation is scheduled to lapse on June 30, 2024.
