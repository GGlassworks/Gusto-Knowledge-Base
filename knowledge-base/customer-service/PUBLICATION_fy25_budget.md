       Forecast Methodology

       The fund consists of taxes levied on various tobacco products and interest earned on those monies. According to A.R.S. §
       36-771.F, the legislature may appropriate monies from the fund to the Department of Revenue for the reasonable
       administration and enforcement costs of the department in administering the levy of taxes that are dedicated to the fund
       pursuant to section A.R.S. § 42-3252. The appropriation shall be applied before monies are deposited in the fund
       accounts. Any unused monies at the end of the fiscal year revert to the fund.

       Methodology: Revenue projections are based on the appropriation and expenditure forecast.

Fund:           RV3745       Escheated Estates Fund

    This fund consists of monies from the sale of escheated estates. Property escheats or reverts to the State, after 5 years when
    there is no will to transmit the property and there are no legal heirs to inherit it. Proceeds from the sale of escheated property are
    held in the fund for 12 months for the payment of claims after which they are transferred to the Permanent State School Fund.

Statutory Reference: A.R.S § 42-1004 General Powers and Duties of the Department


Issue Title:   Increasing ADOR Capacity                                    Priority: #1


1.    Description of issue and how recommending the agency’s request furthers the
agency’s mandates:


Summary
The Arizona Department of Revenue (ADOR) is requesting a $2,086,900 appropriation
increase from the State General Fund for 25 additional personnel to support critical
Department operations. Of this total amount, $54,000 is a one-time request to fund the
purchase of equipment for the newly requested positions.

Detail and Background
As outlined in the FY 2022 ADOR annual report, the Department is responsible for the
collection of $27.8 billion in revenue on an annual basis, all of which flows to Arizona’s
cities, towns, and various State funds, including the General Fund. These revenues fund
critical state and local operations like Arizona’s education system, Medicare programs, and
public safety. The Department engages with individuals, businesses, local government,
federal and state agencies, tax professionals, and others to administer over 20 state and
local taxes, employing a dual strategy of educating Arizona taxpayers and assisting them in
complying with Arizona tax law.
Since 2015, Arizona’s population has grown 1.12% per year on average, which has
translated to steady increases in Arizona’s tax base each year. Census data shows that
over this same time period the number of employer establishments grew by 13.5%, or 2.1%
annually. Additionally, changes to Arizona’s tax nexus, including the impacts that resulted
from Wayfair v. South Dakota, have further expanded the state’s tax base, and thus the
responsibilities of the Department.
In recent years, the State has allocated significant resources to the furthering of taxpayer
education and voluntary compliance in response to the expansion of the tax base. In 2019,
the Department spent $15.0 million total on education and compliance activities, with $1.5
million, or 9.9%% of this spending going specifically to taxpayer education and outreach.
Since then, funding for these activities has more than doubled, growing 101.1%, and now
represents over 15% of spending on both educational and compliance activities. However,
despite these gains in resources for taxpayer education, the Department has not received
adequate resources to maintain the department’s general business operations to keep up
with Arizona’s growing economy.




                                                                                           Page 49
In evaluating this need, ADOR performed a brief survey of revenue departments in similarly
situated states, and notes that Arizona lags severely behind these other states in terms of
staffing capacity. Additionally, ADOR notes that accounts receivables, those taxes owed to
the State but not yet paid, have grown significantly in the last few years and is projected to
continue to grow for the foreseeable future. This growth in accounts receivables has
persisted despite significant efficiency improvements spearheaded by the Department, such
as removing non-value added work requirements and using analytics to determine and
invest in high-value activities. Even with these efficiency wins, the Department is still falling
short of its key duties.

ADOR believes additional resources are needed to bring the department up to a level
commensurate with the current size of Arizona’s tax base, and allow the Department to
more efficiently carry out its duties of assisting with compliance and clarification to Arizona’s
tax law and protecting taxpayers from fraud. ADOR anticipates that these additional
resources will also yield benefits to both the State and local governments by improving the
accuracy of tax collections and lowering accounts receivables. The Department estimates
these additional positions could generate as much as $33.5 million in additional gross
revenues annually, with over $11 million of that total going to the State General Fund,
representing a 427% return on the State’s investment.



2.     Proposal:

The Arizona Department of Revenue (ADOR) recommends staffing additional personnel to
balance enforcement functions with the emphasis on education in recent years. We
recommend staffing an additional 25 FTEs at a cost of $2.1 million on an ongoing basis. In
2017 ADOR, through the TPT simplification legislation, was mandated           to         support
fourteen (14) non-program cities without corresponding resources to address the additional
workload. Directing financial resources that leverage additional personnel to support
increasing the scope of collections and audit activity will result in an additional $33.5 million
in revenue.



3.     Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
       Continuing the “status quo” is an option to increase accounts receivable moving
       forward. This option is not ideal, considering our role in funding Arizona’s priorities.


4.     Impact of not funding this fiscal year:

       The impact of not funding 25 additional FTEs this fiscal year (costing $2.1 million):

       ●   Estimated loss of an opportunity to generate an additional $33.5 million in FY 25
           in revenue and $11.1 million projected to the General Fund.
       ●   Estimated increase to accounts receivable from $1.25 billion to $1.42 billion in
           FY24 with similar increases in FY25.
       ●   Will negatively impact customer service reducing required service levels to the 14
           Non program Cities that were added during the 2017 TPT Simplification.




                                                                                               Page 51
      The increase in staffing is ideal because it allows the Department to do what it does
      best, helping fund Arizona’s future through excellence in innovation, exceptional
      customer service, and public servant-led continuous improvement. As of June 30,
      2023, the accounts receivable have increased to $1.25 billion, a 14% increase from
      the prior year. The two largest tax types of transaction privilege tax (TPT) and
      individual income (IND) represent the most significant volume to AR. To reduce this
      growing number, additional staff are needed.

9.     Alignment with agency’s strategic plan or statutory responsibilities:


       Pursuant to A.R.S. § 42-1004, ADOR is charged with enforcing Arizona’s state and
       local tax laws, and formulating policies, plans, and programs to effectuate its
       missions and purposes. Not only is ADOR the sole collector and administrator of
       municipal-level privilege and affiliated excise taxes under A.R.S. § 42-6001(A), its
       duties extend to assisting other departments, agencies, or institutions of the state,
       local, Indian tribal, and federal governments in furtherance of its purposes,
       objectives, and programs. See A.R.S. § 42-1004(A)(4). To accomplish these
       objectives, ADOR must contract and incur obligations relating to program and
       personnel expenditures within the general scope of its activities and operations
       subject to the availability of funds. See A.R.S. § 42-1004(A)(3).


10. Impact on historically underserved, marginalized or adversely affected groups:


       Increased Department capacity will provide the needed resources to help
       underserved communities and improve the educational opportunities for all Arizona
       citizens. As we continue educating our citizens on proper filing and paying, we
       gather intel on improving instructions, guidelines, and communications. We have
       taken feedback from citizens, stakeholders, and tax associations and have begun
       looking for countermeasures to enhance our outreach efforts.


11. How has feedback been incorporated from groups directly impacted by proposal:


       Through our outreach efforts and analysis of taxpayer behavior, we believe the
       citizens of Arizona want to pay their fair share. Tax Statutes can be complicated
       and providing additional guidance and instruction affords citizens the ability to file
       with confidence. Feedback has been incorporated to additional resources and
       training specific to commonly asked questions that our collectors, auditors, and
       customer experience agents utilize daily.


12. Description of how this furthers the Governor’s priorities:



       This supports the Blueprint:
          ● Common Outcome for Change: Collections and Audit are closely aligned with
              account receivables.
          ● Shared Measurement for Data & Analytics: Accounts receivable is a strategic
              priority the past two years and continues to be measured, monitored, and
              discussed bi-weekly and monthly.




                                                                                                Page 53
●   Mutually Reinforcing Activities: Aligning efforts of Collections and Audit will
    create greater synergy of process and ability to impact both teams with
    information and data.
●   Open and Continuous Communication: As a strategic priority, this is updated
    monthly to the organization as a whole, annually in the Strategic Plan booklet.
●   Backbone Coordinating Organization: The emphasis placed on strategic
    priorities ensures a full agency support and engagement. A cross-functional
    agency team currently supports this strategic priority.

Issue Title: Replacement of Critical Infrastructure Needs and Cloud Readiness          Priority: 2


1.    Description of issue and how recommending the agency’s request furthers the
      agency’s mandates:

      The Arizona Department of Revenue’s (ADOR) FY25 budget proposal is requesting $4.2
      million to cover the replacement of critical infrastructure needs and compliance with State
      and ITAC policy and standards. This request will result in an ongoing expenditure of $1.2
      million.

      The Department is requesting to utilize $1.5 million of fund balance from the Department of
      Revenue Liability Setoff Fund towards the support of this funding issue request. The current
      fund balance is approximately $1.6 million. This fund expects to receive between $900,000
      and $1.0 million in annual revenue with an FY24 appropriation of $887,900. There would be
      limited risk allowing the Department to spend these resources. The remaining request of
      $2.7 million is requested to be supported by a General Fund appropriation.


       This request is composed of the four items listed below.

          1)   Oracle Forms Software Replacement                                        $407,250
          2)   Dell Switch Components Replacement                                       $491,152
          3)   On Prem Storage Hardware Replacement                                     $732,398
          4)   Cloud Readiness                                                         $2,561,000
                                                   Funding Issue Request Total         $4,191,800


      Summary

      The stated purchases will support the ADOR business operations and are required to
      maintain application functionality, data security, and to remain in compliance with
      audits/policies. This results in ADOR’s ability to service taxpayers and other government
      stakeholders. The majority of the costs are one-time but recurring costs are specified below
      in section 8. All costs are based on vendor estimates or Gartner expertise and are subject
      to change.




                                                                                          Page 57
     Multiple factors are contributing to the funding issue.

        1)   In FY25, ADOR must replace Oracle Forms software that will reach end of life.
        2)   In FY25, ADOR must replace Dell switch components that will reach the end of life.
        3)   In FY25, ADOR must replace data backup hardware that will reach end of life.
        4)   ADOR engaged Gartner to recommend a roadmap for cloud readiness that aligns
             with the statewide Cloud First/Smart policy. The report has been shared with the
             Information Technology Authorization Committee (ITAC) and Arizona Strategic
             Enterprise Technology (ASET).

2.   Proposal:


        1) Replace end of life Oracle Forms and Report builder software with Oracle Analytics,
           This will allow ADOR to continue maintaining the primary tax system of record, Tax
           Administration System (TAS) supporting ADOR’s business operations.               The
           replacement allows ADOR to remain on a vendor supported solution maintaining the
           current security level and enabling ADOR to remain in compliance with IRS and
           State standards detailed below. Additionally, the replacement is a Business
           Intelligence product and will provide new reporting and analytics to the Department.

        2) Replace end of life Dell switch components to remain on supported hardware
           maintaining the current security level and enabling ADOR to remain in compliance
           with IRS and State standards detailed below. This is critical infrastructure supporting
           ADOR’s business operations.

        3) Replace the end-of-life data backup hardware with a cloud based solution. This
           aligns with the Cloud First/Smart Policy. The cloud solution replacement will result in
           an annual cost. This allows ADOR to remain on a vendor supported solution
           maintaining the current security level and enabling ADOR to remain in compliance
           with IRS and State standards detailed below. This supports ADOR’s business
           continuity plan.

     Applicable IRS and State standards for end of life hardware and software

     This section applies to all 3 end of life items. ADOR is required to operate using supported
     hardware and software to comply with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Pub 1075
     specifications; therefore, all three items must be replaced with vendor-supported options.
     Furthermore, the ADOR CISO had a discussion with Homeland Security on this topic and
     was referred to a State of Arizona standard. The State of Arizona standard requires
     operating on supported hardware and software. SA-22 in S8120-Information Security
     Program Standard reads:




                                                                                        Page 58
      6.3.3.3 [SA-22]

                     a. Replace system components when support for the components is no
                        longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer; or
                     b. Provide in-house support or support from external providers for
                        Unsupported System Components: The Budget Units shall require the
                        developer of the system, system component, or system service to: [NIST
                        800 53 continued support for unsupported components.

      A Risk Acceptance (RA) is required for systems approaching or past end-of-life if you can
      not mitigate the risk. In the RA, please include any compensating controls in place.

      The link to the standard is https://azdohs.gov/file/4287

      IRS Pub 1075 states:

         SA-22: Unsupported System Components a. Replace system components when support
         for the components is no longer available from the developer, vendor, or manufacturer;
         or b. Provide the following options for alternative sources for continued support for
         unsupported components: Extended security support agreement that include security
         software patches and firmware updates from an external source for each unsupported
         component. Supplemental Guidance: Support for system components includes, for
         example, software patches, firmware updates, replacement parts and maintenance
         contracts. Unsupported components, for example, when vendors no longer provide
         critical software patches or product updates, provide an opportunity for adversaries to
         exploit weaknesses in the installed components. Exceptions to replacing unsupported
         system components may include, for example, systems that provide critical mission or
         business capability where newer technologies are not available or where the systems
         are so isolated that installing replacement components is not an option. Systems that no
         longer receive security patches or product updates may receive critical findings during
         Safeguards reviews. For more information on unsupported system components, see the
         Office of Safeguards website.

Compliance with statewide Cloud First/Smart policy

      4) The execution of Cloud Readiness initiatives aligns with Gartner recommendations and
      complies with the Cloud First/Smart policy. ADOR engaged Gartner Consulting to assess its
      IT environment and develop a multiyear cloud migration roadmap.

      Three components make up the FY25 plan. First, develop a hybrid multi-cloud plane
      architecture. Second, select a cloud-managed services provider. Third, implement the cloud
      control plane. This strategy has been prepared in consultation with Gartner and ASET and
      has been distributed to ITAC.




                                                                                       Page 59
3.   Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:

        1) Due to Oracle Forms and Report Builder reaching the end of life, no option other
           than adopting Analytic Publisher is viable. The Oracle environment must be
           maintained to operate ADOR’s system of record, TAS. TAS is the primary
           application supporting ADOR’s business operations.

        2) The alternative to replacing the end-of-life components for the Dell switches would
           be to operate on unsupported hardware, increasing the potential of security events.
           This is critical infrastructure supporting ADOR’s business operations.

        3) The alternative to implementing a Cloud solution would be to replace the end of life
           hardware with new vendor supported on prem hardware which would not align with
           the Cloud First/Smart policy. Data backup and recovery is necessary to restore
           business operations in the event of data loss and is a key component of ADOR’s
           Continuity of Operations Plan. Additional hardware purchases would require an
           exception from ADOA/ ITAC.


        4) The alternative to implementing cloud initiatives recommended by Gartner would be
           maintaining the status quo with on-premises hosted IT systems. This would require
           future hardware purchases to replace end of life equipment and would be
           non-compliant with the Cloud First/Smart policy. An exception to the Cloud
           First/Smart policy would require approval from ADOA/ITAC.


4.   Impact of not funding this fiscal year:

        1) If the Oracle Forms software replacement is not funded, ADOR would have to
           operate on unsupported software. This would increase the possibility of security
           events, impact ADOR’s ability to remain above the state mandated Risk Sense score
           target, cause the department to be non compliant with IRS and State standards,
           restrict the department’s ability to access vendor support, and potentially limit or
           prevent the department’s ability to make application updates necessitated by
           business requirements and legislative changes.

        2) If the Dell switch components replacement is not funded, ADOR would have to
           operate on unsupported critical infrastructure. This would increase the possibility of
           security events and disruption to ADOR’s business operations, impact ADOR’s ability
           to remain above the state mandated Risk Sense score target, cause the department
           to be non compliant with IRS and State standards, and restrict the department’s
           ability to access vendor support.

        3) If the Cloud storage solution is not funded, ADOR would be required to remain on its
           current on prem backup solution in order to stay compliant with IRS and State
           standards as well support ADOR’s business continuity plan. This would require
           future hardware purchases to replace end of life hardware. Additionally, continuing


                                                                                       Page 60
            to operate on the on prem solution would conflict with the state’s Cloud First/Smart
            policy and additional hardware purchases would require an exception from ADOA/
            ITAC.

        4) If the Cloud Readiness strategy is not funded, it will limit or eliminate ADOR’s ability
           to execute the Gartner recommended cloud migration roadmap plans. This would
           necessitate an exception to the Cloud First/Smart policy required by the State and
           supported by ITAC. Deferring, these initiatives to a later fiscal year may result in the
           need to make additional hardware purchases to replace end of life equipment.
           Additional hardware purchases would require an exception from ADOA/ ITAC.

         Pursuant to A.R.S. § 42-1004(A)(4) and (9), ADOR is required to provide an integrated,
         coordinated, and uniform system of tax administration and revenue collection for the state,
         and must contract and incur obligations within the general scope of its activities and
         operations subject to the availability of funds. Further to these duties and responsibilities,
         ADOR is obligated to secure adequate funding for the machinery, equipment, and services
         necessary to support the Tax Administration System’s end-of-life cycles.


10.      Impact on historically underserved, marginalized or adversely affected groups:


         ADOR has not identified any impact upon these groups.


11.      How has feedback been incorporated from groups directly impacted by proposal:


         ADOR’s Mission to collect and distribute revenue is directly impacted by this proposal.


12. Description of how this furthers the Governor’s priorities:


     ●   Backbone coordinating organization: A secure and stable IT environment is fundamental to
         the operations of the Arizona Department of Revenue.
     ●   Mutually reinforcing activities: The agency is required to replace end of life equipment, and
         this additional funding will significantly assist the department to utilize existing funding to
         drive improvement across education and compliance, taxpayer services, and service to our
         city and town partners.
