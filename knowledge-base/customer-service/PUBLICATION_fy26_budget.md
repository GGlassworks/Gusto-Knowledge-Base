    Revenues come from a 16% excise tax applied to adult-use marijuana and marijuana products; application, license, and biannual
    renewal fees; assessments against licensees who violate statute, rule, or other public health standards; private donations; and
    interest earnings. The fund is used to cover administrative costs to agencies that receive funds, enforcement of Prop 207, and
    distributions to community colleges, municipal police and fire departments, the Justice Reinvestment Fund at DHS, and the
    Highway User Fund at ADOT.

Fund:           RV3745       Escheated Estates Fund

    This fund consists of monies from the sale of escheated estates. Property escheats or reverts to the State, after 5 years when
    there is no will to transmit the property and there are no legal heirs to inherit it. Proceeds from the sale of escheated property are
    held in the fund for 12 months for the payment of claims after which they are transferred to the Permanent State School Fund.

Issue Title: Increasing Operational Capacity                               Priority: #1


   1. Description of issue:
      The Arizona Department of Revenue (ADOR) has faced challenges in keeping pace with an
      11% increase in Accounts Receivables (AR). To address this growing caseload, additional
      resources in staffing and tools are needed. With these resources, ADOR could potentially
      impact AR by $91,000,000 annually, with approximately 63.5% ($57,785,000) of
      enforcement revenue benefiting the General Fund. The revenue management process is
      divided into two phases: early-stage and late-stage efforts. In early stage revenue
      management, accounts delinquent over 60 days are processed through the autodialer that
      calls taxpayers with a goal of securing payment. The autodialer tool achieves a 14% connect
      rate, allowing us to educate taxpayers, answer questions, and establish payment
      arrangements. Throughout the year, ADOR maintains between 4,500 to 13,500 active
      payment arrangements, helping businesses continue operations and enabling Arizonans to
      manage their financial obligations responsibly. Late stage revenue management begins at
      90 days delinquency and our agents manage a caseload of 300 accounts. Late stage
      revenue management requires a higher level of engagement with taxpayers, where our
      agents will work with individuals and businesses to help educate and advise on tax statutes,
      as well as secure payments. Our agents are focused on providing exemplary service while
      supporting individuals and businesses in meeting their tax obligations.

      Revenue management is a time sensitive process and delays contacting taxpayers reduces
      the ability and overall success for collecting on debt. Increasing capacity in both early and
      late stage collections will improve results overall for Arizona. Early stage collections allow
      ADOR to educate our taxpayers on obligations, create payment arrangements, and secure
      payments. Late stage collections are more prescriptive and tailored to the taxpayer
      circumstances that have avoided timely payment.




                                                                                          Page 58
                               FY26 FUNDING ISSUE


2. Proposal:
   ADOR is requesting an additional $2,300,000 to support the expansion of staff and
   resources needed to manage the increasing volume of taxpayer accounts and compliance
   efforts. Since fiscal year 2019, ADOR has experienced a 9.5% increase in returns filed,
   alongside a significant improvement in revenue recovery, driven by a 5.4% population
   growth. The growing demands from new taxpayer accounts have exceeded ADOR’s current
   capacity. This funding is essential to maintaining service levels, ensuring compliance, and
   safeguarding the state’s financial health.

3. Alternatives considered:
   Continuing the “status quo” is an option to increase accounts receivable moving forward.
   This option is not ideal, considering our role in funding Arizona’s priorities. At ADOR we are
   focused on how we can better educate the taxpayer on their responsibilities and provide
   tools that can assist compliance.

4. Impact of not funding this fiscal year:
   Utilizing additional funding, to increase ADOR’s collection staffing, will yield increased
   opportunity to reach deeper into our inventory. Utilizing powerful automated collection
   activity to drive tax compliance of Arizona’s, business and individual income taxpayers using
   customer friendly outreach and enforcement as needed. JP Morgan estimates (Aug, 2024)
   it will become increasingly difficult for revenue management with the probability of a
   recession jumping from 35% in 2024 to 45% in 2025. These factors with a soft labor market
   and rising unemployment will inhibit our ability to readily collect tax obligations in Arizona.

5. Statutory Reference: A.R.S § 42-1004

6. Equipment to be purchased, if applicable:
   Cell Phones, Field Pad, Laptops and Monitors.

7. Classification of new positions:
   The department is not requesting additional FTEs. The department has vacant unbudgeted
   FTEs that can be utilized.

8. Annualization(s)
   Ongoing funding: See Budget Table at the end of this narrative.

9. Alignment with agency’s strategic plan or statutory responsibilities:
   This request supports a current Breakthrough initiative on our FY 25-29 Strategic Plan.



                                                                                       Page 59
                               FY26 FUNDING ISSUE


10. Impact on historically underserved, marginalized or adversely affected groups:
    Increased capacity to support enhanced collection efforts will provide the needed resources
    to help underserved communities and improve the educational opportunities for all Arizona
    citizens. Collectors can impact tax types equally and provide the required education and
    training to a diverse group of taxpayers.

11. How has feedback been incorporated from groups directly impacted by proposal:
    As we continue educating our citizens on proper filing and paying, we gather information on
    improving instructions, guidelines, and communications. We have taken feedback from
    citizens, stakeholders, and tax associations and have begun looking for countermeasures to
    enhance our outreach efforts.

12. Description of how this furthers the Governor’s priorities:
    Additional revenues collected will help support one of the Governor's key priorities, an
    Affordable and Thriving Economy, bolstering the many areas impacted by the General fund.
    Additional staff generating revenue will also support our county and city/town partners with
    further TPT collection and audit activity.

13. If requesting GF (General Fund), why is it critical to continued operations?
    In order to enhance our existing capacity to collect revenues to further the Governor’s
    priorities, the need for additional staff is necessary. The team's current capacity is
    over-extended and we are unable to support what is currently available to collect.

14. If requesting GF (General Fund), why can’t existing funding fully or partially meet the
    need?
    Partial funding will reduce our ability to maintain taxpayer compliance and collect revenues
    that are needed to support the Governor’s priorities.

15. If requesting GF (General Fund), why can’t other funds fully or partially meet the
    need?
    Addressing the Accounts Receivable issue requires a consistent focus and effort. Funding
    from the general fund will allow us to face the ongoing economic uncertainty with
    appropriately aligned funding. ADOR does not have any other available fund sources that
    can be utilized to support administrative costs of the department.

Department/Agency: Arizona Department of Revenue
Division/Program: Agency
Contact Person: Robert Woods
Statutory Reference: A.R.S. § 42-1004

Issue Title: Appropriation Shift from DOR Admin Fund to General Fund               Priority: # 2


   1. Description of issue:
      Agency expenditure appropriations in the ADOR Administration Fund (“ADOR Admin Fund”)
      exceed the mandated revenue by $2,890.9 million. Anticipated annual revenue equals $24.5
      million, and yet the appropriated expenditure authority is $27.1 million. The $24.5 million in
      revenue cannot be increased to match the appropriation of $27.1 million because this would
      require a legislative change, given that the ADOR Admin Fund is capped to a flat $24.5
      million deposit per fiscal year from unclaimed property monies, pursuant to A.R.S. §§
      42-1116.01(A) and 44-313(A)(3). ADOR projects that we will run out of the fund balance in
      the ADOR Admin Fund to pay for expenses in the FY27 Budget.

      The appropriation increase described above ($2,890.9 million) is necessary to assist the
      agency in meeting increased cost obligations. However, the placement of the increased
      appropriation within the ADOR Admin Fund makes it structurally impossible for the agency
      to acquire the necessary funds to meet its ongoing cost obligations, given the
      above-described statutory limitations on the revenue that flows into the Admin Fund ($24.5
      million). Moving expenditures to the General Fund appropriation in future years would be a
      more sustainable configuration for the agency's funding structure.

      The ADOR Admin Fund helps ADOR administer and enforce the state’s tax code under
      A.R.S. § 42-1004. Further to this duty, A.R.S. § 42-1004(A) requires ADOR to: (a) formulate
      policies, plans, and programs that effectuate the agency's missions and purposes; (b)
      employ personnel and contract advisors, consultants, and aides necessary to the
      performance of its duties; and (c) assist other agencies of the state, local, tribal, and federal
      governments in furtherance of its purposes, objectives, and programs. Meeting payroll for
      the positions necessary to meet these statutory obligations of the agency would be a serious
      challenge, if the budget structural balance is left unaddressed.

   2. Proposal:
      A decrease in the ADOR Admin Fund appropriation of $2,890.9 million and an increase in
      the General Fund appropriation by $2,890.9 million will enable ADOR to pay for the overall
      Agency appropriation to meet its obligations under A.R.S. § 42-1004.


                                                                                            Page 65
                              FY26 FUNDING ISSUE


3. Alternatives considered:
   Revenue of $24.5 million could be increased to match the expenditure appropriation of
   $27.1 million. However, this would require a change in legislation, given that the ADOR
   Admin Fund is established solely through a flat $24.5 million deposit per fiscal year from
   unclaimed property monies, pursuant to A.R.S. §§ 42-1116.01(A) and 44-313(A)(3)

4. Impact of not funding this fiscal year:
   In FY24 ADOR collected and distributed $28.2B to the State, 91 cities and towns, 15
   counties, and other entities. Not having the funds to pay for appropriated expenses
   jeopardizes the collection, administration, and distribution of billions of dollars.

5. Statutory Reference:
   A.R.S. § 42-1004, ADOR's mandate is to administer and enforce the state's tax code, and is
   required to formulate policies, plans, and programs that effectuate the agency's missions
   and purposes.

6. Equipment to be purchased, if applicable:
   N/A

7. Classification of new positions:
   N/A

8. Annualization(s)
   On-going

9. Alignment with agency’s strategic plan or statutory responsibilities:
   This request will support all four areas of our strategic plan including two breakthrough
   initiatives. Our priorities to Implement a New Tax System, Increase Taxpayer Compliance,
   Improve User Experience, and Improve Role Satisfaction are all tied to our funding and
   ability to execute. Each of these initiatives are directly tied to A.R.S. § 42-1004, ADOR’s
   role to administer and enforce the state tax code.

10. Impact on historically underserved, marginalized or adversely affected groups:
    Supporting appropriate funding sources will provide the needed resources to help
    underserved communities and improve the educational opportunities for all Arizona citizens.
    The ability to collect and distribute revenue is a vital component of supporting the
    underserved, marginalized and adversely affected groups.



                                                                                     Page 66
                                FY26 FUNDING ISSUE


11. How has feedback been incorporated from groups directly impacted by proposal:
    As we continue external efforts to educate taxpayers on proper filing and paying, we gather
    intel on improving instructions, guidelines, and communications. We have taken feedback
    from citizens, stakeholders, and tax associations and have begun looking for
    countermeasures to enhance our outreach efforts.

12. Description of how this furthers the Governor’s priorities:
    The ability to efficiently distribute revenues collected will help support one of the Governor's
    key priorities, an Affordable and Thriving Economy, bolstering the many areas impacted.
    Additional staff generating revenue will also support our county and city/town partners with
    further support the Agency role to collect and distribute revenue.

13. If requesting GF (General Fund), why is it critical to continued operations?
    ADOR's mandate is to administer and enforce the state's tax code, and is required to
    formulate policies, plans, and programs that effectuate the agency's missions and purposes.

14. If requesting GF (General Fund), why can’t existing funding fully or partially meet the
    need?
    ADOR does not have any other available fund sources that can be utilized to support
    administrative costs of the department.

15. If requesting GF (General Fund), why can’t other funds fully or partially meet the
    need?
    ADOR does not have any other available fund sources that can be utilized to support
    administrative costs of the department.

Description:

The Education and Outreach subprogram is responsible for education and compliance through the processes of community
outreach, coordinating tax enforcement and collection with local and state authorities, supervising the processing of voluntary
disclosure agreements and desk audits, and administration of specialty taxes (jet fuel tax, bingo, etc.) The Agency as a whole
is expanding its Education and Outreach subprogram to all Arizonans, specifically working through the Audit and Assessing
and Collections subprograms and with the Arizona cities and towns to further educate individual income and corporate
taxpayers. To this end, the Outreach component is embedded in all that ADOR does and continues to adapt to keep pace
with the customer need – and expectations.

Mission:

Serving Taxpayers!

Description:

The Audit subprogram is responsible for providing an integrated, coordinated and uniform system of tax administration
designed to ensure that taxpayers correctly calculate and report their corporate income taxes, individual income taxes,
withholding taxes and transaction privilege, use and severance taxes. The Audit subprogram provides education to
taxpayers through the process of field audits, desk audits, and developing training for taxpayers. The Audit subprogram
ensures that auditors are versed in analyzing taxpayers’ books and records, arriving at a correct tax calculation based on
application of Arizona laws to each tax type, and explaining how Arizona laws, rules and regulations apply to each taxpayer.
The Audit subprogram is further responsible for training and supervision of municipal auditors and uniform administration of
both state and local transaction privilege and use taxes levied by counties, cities, towns and other special districts. The Audit
subprogram provides services to other agencies (e.g., the Department of Defense regarding claims by Native Americans, or
the Department of Health Services regarding compliance with tax laws by the medical marijuana dispensaries). The Audit
subprogram is further responsible for reviewing refunds submitted by taxpayers and protecting Arizona state revenues by
denying issuing of those refund claims that are fraudulent or unsubstantiated. Following completion of an audit or refund
review, the Audit subprogram continues to provide education and support to taxpayers and agency representatives
necessary to assist with resolution of taxpayer protests and to provide oversight during litigation.

A.R.S., Title 42

Mission:

Serving Taxpayers!

Description:

The Collections subprogram secures the payment of receivables, delinquent taxes and filing of delinquent returns through
correspondence, telephone, and field contacts with taxpayers.

All collection activity is performed under the overview of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights to promote fairness, confidentiality, and
consistency of application of the tax laws. Arizona was the first state to have a Taxpayer Bill of Rights in 1986, and the 1994
updated version again put Arizona in the leadership role of protecting taxpayer rights, while ensuring that all taxpayers pay
their fair share of the tax burden.

The subprogram also works with delinquent taxpayers by entering into payment arrangements and educating them in
compliance (filing obligations) issues. Upon the taxpayer's action to void the agreement, enforcement collections activity is
pursued including filing liens, levies, and seizures of assets.

Description:

The Education and Outreach subprogram is responsible for education and compliance through the processes of community
outreach, coordinating tax enforcement and collection with local and state authorities, supervising the processing of voluntary
disclosure agreements and desk audits, and administration of specialty taxes (jet fuel tax, bingo, etc.) The Agency as a whole
is expanding its Education and Outreach subprogram to all Arizonans, specifically working through the Audit and Assessing
and Collections subprograms and with the Arizona cities and towns to further educate individual income and corporate
taxpayers. To this end, the Outreach component is embedded in all that ADOR does and continues to adapt to keep pace with
the customer need – and expectations.

Description:

The Audit subprogram is responsible for providing an integrated, coordinated and uniform system of tax administration
designed to ensure that taxpayers correctly calculate and report their corporate income taxes, individual income taxes,
withholding taxes and transaction privilege, use and severance taxes. The Audit subprogram provides education to taxpayers
through the process of field audits, desk audits, and developing training for taxpayers. The Audit subprogram ensures that
auditors are versed in analyzing taxpayers’ books and records, arriving at a correct tax calculation based on application of
Arizona laws to each tax type, and explaining how Arizona laws, rules and regulations apply to each taxpayer. The Audit
subprogram is further responsible for training and supervision of municipal auditors and uniform administration of both state
and local transaction privilege and use taxes levied by counties, cities, towns and other special districts. The Audit subprogram
provides services to other agencies (e.g., the Department of Defense regarding claims by Native Americans, or the Department
of Health Services regarding compliance with tax laws by the medical marijuana dispensaries). The Audit subprogram is
further responsible for reviewing refunds submitted by taxpayers and protecting Arizona state revenues by denying issuing of
those refund claims that are fraudulent or unsubstantiated. Following completion of an audit or refund review, the Audit
subprogram continues to provide education and support to taxpayers and agency representatives necessary to assist with
resolution of taxpayer protests and to provide oversight during litigation.

Mission:

Serving Taxpayers!

Description:

The Collections subprogram secures the payment of receivables, delinquent taxes and filing of delinquent returns through
correspondence, telephone, and field contacts with taxpayers.

All collection activity is performed under the overview of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights to promote fairness, confidentiality, and
consistency of application of the tax laws. Arizona was the first state to have a Taxpayer Bill of Rights in 1986, and the 1994
updated version again put Arizona in the leadership role of protecting taxpayer rights, while ensuring that all taxpayers pay
their fair share of the tax burden.

The subprogram also works with delinquent taxpayers by entering into payment arrangements and educating them in
compliance (filing obligations) issues. Upon the taxpayer's action to void the agreement, enforcement collections activity is
pursued including filing liens, levies, and seizures of assets.
