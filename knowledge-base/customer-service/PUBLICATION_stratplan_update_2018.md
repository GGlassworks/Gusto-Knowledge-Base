 Our strategy begins with a comprehensive look at ADOR’s ecosystem as an organization — an ecosystem
 that includes a variety of perspectives and demands that influence our vital mission. We then make an honest
 assessment of our recent past and current reality, including a brutally honest evaluation of our performance. We
 refer to this as the “current state.” The Governor’s vision for the State and the agency’s vision together define           Carlton Woodruff                                 Grant Nülle

 our desired “future state.” It is by analyzing the gap between our current state and future state that we develop
 our plan. ADOR has adopted strategic goals to close the gap between the reality of our current challenges and
 future state vision.

 In addition to the goals, ADOR has identified strategic initiatives to help overcome challenges that could keep
 us from closing the gap. The strategies are to be developed as specific projects to resolve the challenges. The         Tom Johnson                      Derek Beck            Neeraj Deshpande
 outcomes associated with our goals, as supported by our strategies, and as executed through our projects, will      EDUCATION & COMPLIANCE                PROCESSING             TAXPAYER SERVICES
 be measured rigorously by our performance measures.

 The performance measures ADOR has adopted track success through two primary lenses: the return on
 investment that taxpayers demand as an outcome of fulfilling our mission — i.e., delivering the revenue that
 finances Arizona’s future, and customer value in the form of quality service.

                                                                                                                                                          SUPPORT
