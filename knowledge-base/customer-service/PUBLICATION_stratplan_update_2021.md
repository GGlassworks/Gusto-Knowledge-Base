 voluntary compliance, managing data maturity, and initiating a tax system
 replacement.

 The department is challenging itself to build a new and improved culture inside
 and outside the organization.

 For FY 2020, the agency is reinforcing leader standard work, employee development,
 relationships with stakeholders, and education resulting in voluntary compliance.

 The FY 2021 Strategic Plan Update highlights the goals, strategies, and performance
 measures critical to the department’s ongoing success. The four goals that guide
 ADOR in accomplishing its mission are the following:

 Goal 1 - Optimize Employee Culture: Create an environment focused on well-
 being, goal alignment, vision, and purpose from recruitment to retirement. Enable
 a completely functioning remote workforce while remaining connected to staff
 and no disruptions in services to taxpayers.

 Goal 2 - Maximize Agency Effectiveness and Efficiency: Review processes to ensure
 focus on what is required and realistic. Prioritize by impact and frequency with
 financial tools that promote a reduction in time, costs, and resources.

 We refer to this as the “current state”. The Governor’s vision for the state and the
 agency’s vision together define our desired “future state”. It is by analyzing the
