 We have robust internal communications and all-staff meetings bringing all
 employees together in a spirit of shared purpose and collegiality.

 Our goals for FY 2022:
 Optimize Employee Culture: Create an environment focused on well-being, goal
 alignment, vision, and purpose from recruitment to retirement.

 Maximize Agency Effectiveness & Efficiency: Review processes to ensure focus
 on what is required and realistic. Prioritize by impact and frequency with financial
 tools that promote reduction in time, costs, and resources.
