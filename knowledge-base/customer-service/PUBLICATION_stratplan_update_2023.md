                     As we present the fiscal year (FY) 2023 update to the Arizona      tools that promote reduction in time, costs, and resources.
                     Department of Revenue Strategic Plan, we look at how our

                      administering, and distributing revenue with high efficiency.     feedback we receive to improve processes.
                      FY 2022 was a milestone year, as ADOR collected a record $27.8

We’ve also been integral in implementing a new service for businesses to more
easily set up shop in our state. Business One Stop went live and will significantly
benefit Arizona’s business owners and job creators.

Looking forward to the coming year, we are putting a detemined focus on enhancing
customer experience with additional resources for our Call Center Operations. We
are expanding third-party support, hours of operation, and robust training for our
call center. We have already reduced hold times by 65% and are well on our way
to a goal of under 10 minutes’ hold time by December 2022. We will continue to
leverage technology, working towards allowing our taxpayers the ability to self-
service multiple different options 24 hours a day.

Another major effort for our ADOR team is the State Tax Accounting and Reconciliation
System (STARS), a multi-year technology upgrade to a new processing platform that
will give Arizona’s taxpayers a more efficient and smoother experience with our
agency.

Our goals for FY 2022:
Optimize Employee Culture: Create an environment focused on well-being, goal
alignment, vision, and purpose from recruitment to retirement.

Maximize Agency Effectiveness & Efficiency: Review processes to ensure focus
on what is required and realistic. Prioritize by impact and frequency with financial

 organization — an ecosystem that includes a variety of perspectives and demands
 that influence our vital mission. We then make an honest assessment of our recent
 past and current reality, including a brutally honest evaluation of our performance.
 We refer to this as the “current state.” The Governor’s vision for the state and the
 agency’s vision together define our desired “future state.” It is by analyzing the gap         Neeraj Deshpande
 between our current and future states that we develop our plan. ADOR has adopted                 DEPUTY DIRECTOR

 future state vision.

 In addition to goals, ADOR has identified strategic initiatives to help overcome         Kathy Gamboa        Sean Price       Kathy Gamboa

 projects, will be measured rigorously by our performance measures.
