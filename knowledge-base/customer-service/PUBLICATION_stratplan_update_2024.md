FOREWORD :
                      I am pleased to present the Arizona Department of Revenue’s          that will give Arizona’s taxpayers a more efficient and smoother experience with our
                      fiscal year (FY) 2024 Strategic Plan, and share with you our         agency.
                      successes and goals to serve Arizona’s taxpayers and maintain
                      our strong culture.                                                  ADOR is poised for another great year with our focus on providing excellent service
                                                                                           to Arizona’s taxpayers and providing a rewarding workplace for our team members.
                     For FY 2023, Arizona Department of Revenue (ADOR) collected
                     a record $28.4 billion to fund Arizona’s programs and services,       Rob Woods
                     contributing to the state’s healthy economic future. The FY           Director
                     2023 total surpassed the $27.8 billion from FY 2022, which also
exceeded the FY 2021 total of $24 billion. With an appropriation of approximately
$91 million, our agency is an excellent steward of the resources we are given to fulfill
our mission.

For the second year in a row, ADOR has been named one of the Top Companies to
Work for in Arizona, awarded by Best Companies AZ and the Arizona Capitol Times.
This designation is a testament of our team’s culture of caring and the dedication
our people have to continuous improvement and always doing the right thing.

Looking forward to the coming year, for FY 2024, we have set some ambitious and
pivotal strategic goals.

ADOR is defining and developing Talent Career Mobility options for our team
members, creating processes, and identifying resources to take our team into the
future and make us more robust than ever.

We retain our strategic goal to reduce the Transaction Privilege Tax Accounts
Receivable (AR) Balance. This includes defining the percentage collectable by tax
type, measuring balance cyclicality and variance, and looking at the collections
cycle plan.

We will enhance internal and external stakeholder relationships, enhancing our
collaboration, and ensuring we effectively engaging with the community we work
with and serve.


In the near term, a key priority for the Department is timely implementing the Senate
Bill 1734 AZ Family Tax Rebate passed by the legislature and signed by Governor
Hobbs, as per statute.

We are also continuing our work to implement the State Tax Accounting and
Reconciliation System, a multi-year technology upgrade to a new processing platform

 organization — an ecosystem that includes a variety of perspectives and demands
 that influence our vital mission. We then honestly assess our recent past and
 current reality, including a brutally honest evaluation of our performance. We refer
 to this as the “current state.” We develop out plan by analyzing the gap between
 our current and future states. ADOR has adopted strategic goals to close the gap            Neeraj Deshpande
