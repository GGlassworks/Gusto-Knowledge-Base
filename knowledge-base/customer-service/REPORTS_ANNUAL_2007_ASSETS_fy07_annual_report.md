    Phoenix, Arizona 85007
    Dear Governor Napolitano and the Taxpayers of Arizona:

    Fiscal year 2007 was another milestone year in that we collected more than $14 billion as an agency.
    Total taxes collected by the department during fiscal year 2007 exceeded $14.4 billion, including more
    than $8.7 billion that was deposited directly into the state General Fund. Included in this total is $585.9
    million that was collected through the department’s tax enforcement efforts. By collecting $585.9 million
    through the audit, license compliance, and collections programs, the department exceeded the $461
    million target set at the beginning of the year, performing at 126% of goal.

    One area to highlight this year is the Audit division’s “Nexus” program. The Nexus Program assists
    businesses involved in multi state commerce to voluntarily resolve potential state sales/use tax and/or
    income/franchise tax liabilities where nexus is the central issue. Taxpayers benefit by resolving
    potential Arizona tax disputes before being assessed with prior year audits of taxes, interest and
    penalties. Between identifying nexus candidates and administering the Voluntary Disclosure
    Program, the Nexus Unit collected over $40M in taxes for fiscal year 2007. This was quite an
    accomplishment for the two person unit!

    Another noteworthy highlight is that the Department processed over 1.3 million electronically filed
    income tax returns during the last tax season. Interest in alternatives to paper filing has increased over
    the past few years and DOR’s commitment to provide further opportunities has grown accordingly.

    The Department’s major revenue contributions were achieved while still performing other services at
    high performance levels and working through the continuing implementation of the Business
    Reengineering/Integrated Tax System (BRITS) project. Information Technology’s focus continues to
    be on support for data conversions to the new BRITS platform and ongoing maintenance of Legacy
    and BRITS systems. The successful conversion of the corporate tax system to BRITS occurred in
    September. Department resources are already actively working on the conversion of the income tax
    system to BRITS, which will occur in fiscal year 2008.
    As we go forward, we will continue to address our three core goals as outlined in our strategic plan:
       • To increase our return on investment; we focus on issues of increased productivity and cost
           effectiveness throughout the agency.
       • To increase customer and stakeholder satisfaction; we focus on customer feedback to learn
           what we are doing well and where we need improvement so we can target our process
           improvement efforts appropriately.
       • To increase employee satisfaction; we focus on our employees and their job performance and
           satisfaction.
    We hope you enjoy reading our Annual Report and find it informative. If you have any questions or
    comments, please feel free to contact me.
    Sincerely,



    Gale Garriott

USE TAX
A 5% use tax is imposed on the purchase price of
tangible personal property when a transaction privilege
tax equal to or greater than the Arizona rate was not
paid. A use tax collection responsibility is imposed on
retailers whose activities in the state are insufficient to
require them to pay transaction privilege tax but are
nonetheless substantial enough to fall outside the
protective umbrella of the United States Constitutional
provision governing interstate commerce. Firms
without nexus may also voluntarily collect use tax for
the benefit of their customers.

BINGO
The tax on state licensed bingo operations is based on a multi-tiered licensing structure. There are three
classes of bingo licenses, each of which has a different tax rate.
Each licensee’s tax rate is based on bingo receipts. Class A licensees, whose gross receipts do not exceed
$15,600 per year, are taxed at 2.5 percent of their adjusted gross receipts. (Adjusted gross receipts are the
monies left after paying prizes.) Class B and Class C licensees are taxed on their gross receipts. Class B
licensees, whose gross receipts do not exceed $300,000, are taxed at 1.5 percent of their gross receipts.
Class C licensees, whose gross receipts exceed $300,000 per year, are taxed at 2 percent of their gross
receipts from bingo.
All taxes collected are deposited in the state general fund. A total of $ 619,387 was deposited in fiscal year
2007 (Refer to Table 39).

ESTATE TAX
Arizona’s Estate Tax was effectively repealed January 1, 2005, following the IRS’s elimination of the Federal
State Death Tax Credit. No Arizona estate tax is owed on the estate of a person who dies after 2004 and there is
no requirement to file an Arizona Form 76. We will continue to receive late original returns and amended tax
returns for decedents with a date of death prior to 2005 as it can take years to settle a complicated estate.
The Arizona estate tax is a tax on the transfer of property or interest in property that takes effect upon the
owner’s death. The estate tax is imposed on the net taxable estate before distribution, differing from the
inheritance tax, which is imposed on the portion of the estate received by a beneficiary. Arizona does not
impose inheritance or gift taxes. Estate taxes are deposited into the state general fund. (Refer to Table 40.)
The Special Taxes Unit of the Arizona Department of Revenue is responsible for the collection of estate taxes
and the processing of estate tax returns and reports of personal representative of decedent.
Only estates that are required to file a federal estate tax return are required to file an Arizona Estate Tax return.
The Arizona estate tax for an Arizona resident decedent is an amount equal to the federal credit for state death
taxes. If the decedent owned real or tangible personal property located in another state, the Arizona tax is
reduced by either the amount of death tax paid to the other state or a prorated share of the federal credit,
whichever is less.
The Arizona estate tax for a nonresident decedent is a prorated share of the federal credit, based on the value of
real property and tangible personal property having actual situs in Arizona this year.

LUXURY TAX
Arizona’s luxury tax applies to cigarettes, other tobacco products, and alcoholic beverages. The department is
responsible for issuing tobacco licenses and stamps and collecting taxes on tobacco products and alcoholic
beverages. The department also investigates and confiscates contraband tobacco products. During the 2007 fiscal
year, over $421 million was received in luxury tax collections.

Of the monies collected per the Tobacco Products Referendum (Prop 303), $60.2 million was distributed to the
Prop 204 Protection Account, $38.7 million to the Medically Needy Account, $28.7 million for Emergency
Health Services, $7.1 million for Health Research, and $2.9 million for Health Education. Due to the passage of
the Tobacco Tax and Health Care Initiative in November 1994, $71.6 million was allocated to the Medically
Needy Fund, $23.8 million to the Health Education Fund and $5.2 million to the Health Research Fund. The
Corrections Fund, established by the Legislature in 1984 to pay for prison construction, received $28.7 million,
and the Arizona Wine Promotional Fund received $35,965. The Drug Treatment and Education Fund received
$8.3 million, and the Corrections Revolving Fund received $3.3 million due to the passage of Proposition 200 in
1994. The Smoke Free AZ fund received $1.8 due to the passage of Proposition 201 in 2006. The Early
Childhood Development and Health Fund received $74.4 million due to the passage of Proposition 203 in 2006.
The remaining $65.9 million was deposited into the state general fund. (Refer to Table 41)

UNCLAIMED PROPERTY
Responsibilities of the Unclaimed Property Program include the collection, safekeeping, and disposition of
abandoned property and escheated estates.
The Unclaimed Property staff establishes and maintains records of these types of funds along with other
personal property that is presumed to be abandoned. This property is received from business associations,
banking and financial institutions, insurance companies, utility companies, fiduciaries, state courts, and
governmental agencies.
The most common examples of unclaimed property are:
•   Payroll checks written to employees not cashed after one year.
•   Utility deposits not claimed in two years.
•   Contents of safe deposit boxes on which rent has not been paid for three years.
•   Government and Court property not claimed in three years.
•   Stock or other equity interest in a business association or financial institution with no activity for three
    years.
•   Checks written to vendors or customers not cashed after five years.
•   Bank or credit union accounts with no activity for five years.
•   Cashier and other official checks not cashed in five years.
•   Money orders not cashed in seven years.
•   Traveler’s checks not cashed in fifteen years.
There is no statute of limitations for filing a claim for unclaimed property. Owners may recover their
property at any time with proper documentation.
ESCHEATED ESTATES
In addition to their Unclaimed Property responsibilities, staff members also establish and maintain records
of Escheated Estates. An Escheated Estate is created when a person dies without leaving a will and has no
known heirs. When this condition exists, his or her property reverts to the state as the original and ultimate
proprietor after seven years. Funds received from escheated estates are deposited into the permanent school
fund. (Refer to Table 42.)
