    Dear Governor Brewer:

    Here is your Department of Revenue’s 2012 Annual Report.

    In an effort to better serve you and the citizens of Arizona, we spent some time in fiscal year 2012
    assessing our resources, focusing on our core business processes and planning for the future. Our
    recent strategic planning sessions helped us identify key issues to address in order for us to continue
    to be successful. We also plan to work closely with your new Government Transformation Office to
    make your Department of Revenue more efficient and effective.

    Some key information is that total taxes collected by the department during fiscal year 2012 exceeded
    $13.0 billion, including more than $7.1 billion that was deposited directly into the state General Fund.
    Included in this total is over $484 million that was collected through the department’s tax enforcement
    efforts. By collecting over $484 million through the audit, license compliance, and collections
    programs, the department nearly met its $501 million target set at the beginning of the year;
    performing at 97% of goal.

    In addition to these milestones in tax administration, Department of Revenue employees achieved
    several noteworthy accomplishments in fiscal year 2012 including: processing over 5.6 million tax
    documents; processing over 40,000 new business licenses, and receiving, processing and depositing
    4.1 million payments. You can view more of these accomplishments by division in the “Division
    Highlights” section of this report.

    Additionally, we, as a Department, continue to focus on our three core goals:

           To increase our return on investment.
           To increase customer and stakeholder satisfaction.
           To increase employee satisfaction.

    Thanks to the esprit de corps and hard work of our employees, the department continues to provide
    superior tax administration services to Arizona.

    Thank you for your leadership.

    Please contact me if you require any additional information.


    Sincerely,



    John Greene
    Director

Field Collections
If an Office Collector determines that a case cannot
be resolved by phone and that a field (on-site)
approach is warranted, the case is referred to the
Field Collections section.
Field collectors are assigned a territory (by ZIP
code) and are responsible for all types of tax cases
(mostly large balance business cases) in the
territory. Field collectors use a combination of
telephone and field visits. In addition to
recommending lien and levy action, Field collectors
may subpoena records, investigate Offers-in-

writing off cases if they are determined to be

to reach closure in the least intrusive manner.

deposited directly to the state general fund (Refer to

general fund.
USE TAX
A 6.6% use tax is imposed on the purchase price of
tangible personal property when a transaction privilege
tax equal to or greater than the Arizona rate was not
paid. A use tax collection responsibility is imposed on
retailers whose activities in the state are insufficient to
require them to pay transaction privilege tax but are
nonetheless substantial enough to fall outside the
protective umbrella of the United States Constitutional
provision governing interstate commerce. Firms
without nexus may also voluntarily collect use tax for
the benefit of their customers.

BINGO
The tax on state licensed bingo operations is based on a multi-tiered licensing structure. There are three
classes of bingo licenses, each of which has a different tax rate.
Each licensee’s tax rate is based on bingo receipts. Class A licensees, whose gross receipts do not exceed
$15,600 per year, are taxed at 2.5 percent of their adjusted gross receipts. (Adjusted gross receipts are the
monies left after paying prizes.) Class B and Class C licensees are taxed on their gross receipts. Class B
licensees, whose gross receipts do not exceed $300,000, are taxed at 1.5 percent of their gross receipts.
Class C licensees, whose gross receipts exceed $300,000 per year, are taxed at 2 percent of their gross
receipts from bingo.
All taxes collected are deposited in the state general fund (Refer to Table 39).

ESTATE TAX
Arizona’s Estate Tax was effectively repealed January 1, 2005, following the elimination of the Federal State
Death Tax Credit by Congress. No Arizona estate tax is owed on the estate of a person who dies after 2004 and
there is no requirement to file an Arizona Form 76. We continue to receive late original returns and amended
tax returns for decedents with a date of death prior to 2005 as it can take years to settle a complicated estate.
Only estates that are required to file a federal estate tax return are required to file an Arizona Estate Tax return.
The Arizona estate tax for an Arizona resident decedent is an amount equal to the federal credit for state death
taxes. If the decedent owned real or tangible personal property located in another state, the Arizona tax is
reduced by either the amount of death tax paid to the other state or a prorated share of the federal credit,
whichever is less.
The Arizona estate tax for a nonresident decedent is a prorated share of the federal credit, based on the value of
real property and tangible personal property having actual situs in Arizona this year.
The Arizona estate tax is a tax on the transfer of property or interest in property that takes effect upon the
owner’s death. The estate tax is imposed on the net taxable estate before distribution, differing from the
inheritance tax, which is imposed on the portion of the estate received by a beneficiary. Arizona does not
impose inheritance or gift taxes. Estate taxes are deposited into the state general fund. (Refer to Table 40.)
The Special Taxes Unit of the Arizona Department of Revenue is responsible for the collection of estate taxes
and the processing of estate tax returns and reports of personal representative of decedent.

LUXURY TAX
Arizona’s luxury tax applies to cigarettes, other tobacco products, and alcoholic beverages. The department is
responsible for issuing tobacco licenses and stamps and collecting taxes on tobacco products and alcoholic
beverages. The department also investigates and confiscates contraband tobacco products. During the 2012 fiscal
year, over $388 million was received in luxury tax collections.

Of the monies collected per the Tobacco Products Referendum (Prop 303), $39.8 million was distributed to the
Prop 204 Protection Account, $25.6 million to the Medically Needy Account, $18.9 million for Emergency
Health Services, $4.7 million for Health Research, and $1.9 million for Health Education. Due to the passage of
the Tobacco Tax and Health Care Initiative in November 1994, $46.9 million was distributed to the Medically
Needy Fund, $15.4 million to the Health Education Fund and $3.4 million to the Health Research Fund. The
Corrections Fund, established by the Legislature in 1984 to pay for prison construction, received $28.5 million.
The Drug Treatment and Education Fund received $8.8 million, and the Corrections Revolving Fund received
$3.5 million due to the passage of Proposition 200 in 1994. The Smoke Free AZ fund received $3.0 million due
to the passage of Proposition 201 in 2006. The Early Childhood Development and Health Fund received $129.4
million due to the passage of Proposition 203 in 2006. The remaining $56.4 million was deposited into the state
general fund. (Refer to Table 41)

UNCLAIMED PROPERTY
Responsibilities of the Unclaimed Property Program include the collection, safekeeping, and disposition of
abandoned property and escheated estates.

The Unclaimed Property staff establishes and maintains records of these types of funds along with other
intangible and tangible personal property that is presumed to be abandoned. This property is received from
business associations, banking and financial institutions, insurance companies, fiduciaries, state courts, and
governmental agencies.

Common examples of unclaimed property are:

      State warrants not cashed after six months.
      Payroll checks written to employees not cashed after one year.
      Contents of safe deposit boxes on which rent has not been paid for three years.
      Government and Court property not claimed in two years.
      Stock or other equity interest in a business association or financial institution with no activity for three
       years.
      Bank or credit union accounts with no activity for three years.
      Cashier and other official checks not cashed in three years.
      Checks written to vendors or customers not cashed after three years.
      Money orders not cashed in three years.
      Traveler’s checks not cashed in fifteen years.

There is no statute of limitations for filing a claim for unclaimed property. Owners may recover their property
at any time with proper documentation.

ESCHEATED ESTATES
In addition to their Unclaimed Property responsibilities, staff members also establish and maintain records of
Escheated Estates. An Escheated Estate is created when a person dies without leaving a will and has no known
heirs. When this condition exists, his or her property reverts to the state as the original and ultimate proprietor
after seven years. Funds received from escheated estates are deposited into the Permanent State School Fund.
(Refer to Table 42.)
