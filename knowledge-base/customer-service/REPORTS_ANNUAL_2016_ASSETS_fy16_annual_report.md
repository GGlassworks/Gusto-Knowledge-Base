ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE
 FISCAL YEAR 2016 ANNUAL REPORT
Directors Message
Upon my arrival, among the first activities we took was to align our core programs with the
agency’s budget, which immediately helped to stabilize department expenditures and reduced
the number of operating divisions from nine to four. We improved key support functions by
overhauling our information technology and budget offices and establishing a professional
communications presence for enhanced dialogue with our customers and employees.

During FY 2016, we set the foundation for landing the first phase of statutorily required reforms
of the state’s Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT) system, enabling hundreds of thousands of
businesses to register, file returns and make TPT payments via a central online portal with
prompt and accurate tax distribution and reporting to appropriate municipalities.

We also instituted a standard, disciplined approach to manage the department’s performance
using tools such as scorecards and monthly business reviews to align our mission priorities with
those the governor has set for the state. These activities are a featured component of the
intentional, results-driven management system Arizona is adopting throughout state
government. Our efforts are focused on delivering customer value and tangible mission
outcomes that taxpayers expect of their state workforce. Today we are professionally managing
the department’s operations by eliminating waste and inefficiencies through an exhaustive
review of our processes, and every DOR employee understands the importance of being
responsive to customer needs and expectations.

The need to modernize and develop technical and operational excellence in our workforce is
crucial if we are to operate at the speed of business, as the governor intends. In addition to the
organizational improvements mentioned earlier, we have begun taking steps to ensure we
build capacity to deliver desired performance by making investment in core infrastructure a
departmental priority.

FY 2016 was one of the most exciting and productive years in my 30-year career of public
service for the citizens of Arizona. I’m proud of the changes we are making to radically
transform how DOR thinks and does business for Arizona taxpayers. As you read through
our record of fiscal year successes, I hope you will think so, too.

Director
Arizona Department of Revenue
Who We Are
Our History
The Department of Revenue’s origins predate Arizona statehood. The State Tax Commission, established
in 1912, consisted of a three-member, non-partisan board elected for a six-year term. In 1974, the
Arizona Legislature repealed the law that had established the commission and transferred its powers
and duties to the newly created Arizona Department of Revenue (ADOR) and the State Board of Tax
Appeals. That same year, on July 1, ADOR began operations with three divisions overseeing Property and
Special Taxes; Income, Luxury, Sales and Estate Taxes; and Administration.

Today, ADOR comprises four divisions aligned with its operating budget and strategic goals: Taxpayer
Services, Education and Compliance, Processing, and Support. It operates with offices in Phoenix and
Tucson with a presence in the Phoenix Metro East Valley area. ADOR delivers core business processes
entailing efficient tax processing and collection, timely enforcement of tax laws, and accurate valuation of
property. In addition, it also oversees 15 county assessors in the administration of state property tax laws.

Miscellaneous Tax
Bingo Collections

The tax on state licensed bingo operations is based on a multi-tiered licensing structure. There are three
classes of bingo licenses, each of which has a different tax rate.

Each licensee’s tax rate is based on bingo receipts. Class A licensees, whose gross receipts do not exceed
$15,600 per year, are taxed at 2.5 percent of their adjusted gross receipts. (Adjusted gross receipts are
the monies left after paying prizes.) Class B and Class C licensees are taxed on their gross receipts. Class
B licensees, whose gross receipts do not exceed $300,000, are taxed at 1.5 percent of their gross
receipts. Class C licensees, whose gross receipts exceed $300,000 per year, are taxed at 2 percent of
their gross receipts from bingo.

All taxes collected are deposited in the state general fund (Refer to Table 39).

Miscellaneous Tax
Estate Tax Collections

Arizona’s Estate Tax was effectively repealed January 1, 2005, following the elimination of the Federal
State Death Tax Credit by Congress. No Arizona estate tax is owed on the estate of a person who dies
after 2004 and there is no requirement to file an Arizona Form 76. We continue to receive late original
returns and amended tax returns for decedents with a date of death prior to 2005 as it can take years to
settle a complicated estate.

Luxury Tax Collections

Arizona’s luxury tax applies to cigarettes, other tobacco products, and alcoholic beverages. The

department is responsible for issuing tobacco licenses and stamps and collecting taxes on tobacco

products and alcoholic beverages. The department also investigates and confiscates contraband tobacco

products.


Of the monies collected per the Tobacco Products Referendum (Prop 303), $40.3 million was distributed

to the Prop 204 Protection Account, $25.9 million to the Medically Needy Account, $19.2 million for

Emergency Health Services, $4.8 million for Health Research, and $1.9 million for Health Education. Due

to the passage of the Tobacco Tax and Health Care Initiative in November 1994, $47.5 million was

distributed to the Medically Needy Fund, $15.6 million to the Health Education Fund and $3.4 million to

the Health Research Fund. The Corrections Fund, established by the Legislature in 1984 to pay for prison

construction, received $30.1 million. The Drug Treatment and Education Fund received $9.2 million, and

the Corrections Revolving Fund received $3.7 million due to the passage of Proposition 200 in 1994. The

Smoke Free AZ fund received $2.9 million due to the passage of Proposition 201 in 2006. The Early

Childhood Development and Health Fund received $126.2 million due to the passage of Proposition 203

in 2006. The remaining $58.2 million was deposited into the state general fund. (Refer to Table 41)

Unclaimed Property Collections and Distributions
Responsibilities of the Unclaimed Property Unit include the collection, safekeeping, and disposition of
abandoned property and escheated estates.

The Unclaimed Property staff receives and maintains records related to unclaimed funds along with
other intangible and tangible personal property that is presumed to be abandoned. This property is
received from business associations, banking and financial institutions, insurance companies, fiduciaries,
state courts, and governmental agencies.

Common examples of unclaimed property are:

    •   State warrants not cashed after six months.

    •   Payroll checks written to employees not cashed after one year.

    •   Contents of safe deposit boxes on which rent has not been paid for three years.

    •   Government and Court property not claimed in two years.

    •   Stock or other equity interest in a business association or financial institution with no activity for
        three years.

    •   Bank or credit union accounts with no activity for three years.

    •   Cashier and other official checks not cashed in three years.

    •   Checks written to vendors or customers not cashed after three years.

    •   Money orders not cashed in three years.

    •   Traveler’s checks not cashed in fifteen years.

There is no statute of limitations for filing a claim for unclaimed property. Owners may recover their
property at any time with proper documentation.

ESCHEATED ESTATES

In addition to their Unclaimed Property responsibilities, staff members also establish and maintain
records of Escheated Estates. An Escheated Estate is created when a person dies without leaving a will
and has no known heirs. When this condition exists, his or her property reverts to the state as the
original and ultimate proprietor after seven years. Funds received from escheated estates are deposited
into the Permanent State School Fund. (Refer to Table 42.)
