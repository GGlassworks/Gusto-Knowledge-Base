Directors Message

Fiscal year 2017 continued to be a period of transformation for the Arizona Department of Revenue
(ADOR) marked with successes as demonstrated in the 2017 Annual Report.
With our mission of “Serving Taxpayers!”, and vision of funding Arizona’s future through excellence in
innovation, customer service and continuous improvement, ADOR is continuing to identify new ways to
deliver better, faster and more cost-effective services for Arizonans.
Following Governor Ducey’s call to deliver services at the speed of business, the Annual Report outlines
the agency’s drive to achieve its mission, and strategic steps being taken to address key pressure points
and continue to make the Department of Revenue increasingly user friendly. This included the fact 535
ADOR employees processed 6 million tax documents and collected more than $15.6 billion in fiscal year
2017 for key Arizona programs and services.
The Arizona Department of Revenue has taken decisive and deliberate actions to respond to the ever
changing needs of Arizona taxpayers and to deliver more efficient and effective services.
ADOR is moving forward with e-solutions that better serve taxpayers, including automated processing of
millions of tax returns and payments and expanding electronic filing and payment for all tax types to
increase efficiency.
The Department is also challenging itself to accelerate processing returns for all major tax types faster
than ever.
ADOR has delivered on its commitment to fully implement the state’s transaction privilege tax (TPT)
system with the onboarding of the 14 remaining Arizona cities on Jan. 1, 2017, bringing the total to 91
municipalities. Under TPT, business taxpayers are able to register, file one return for all taxing
jurisdictions and make TPT payments via AZTaxes.gov, no longer having to file two or more TPT returns.
The Arizona Department of Revenue has placed a renewed emphasis on education and outreach
through expanded partnerships with stakeholders, such as county and municipal governments, tax
professionals and various taxpayer-represented associations.
Our focus remains on deploying results-driven management, called the Arizona Management System
(AMS), which is all about delivering better, faster and more cost-effective service for Arizonans. This
ambitious program, which eliminates waste and inefficiencies throughout the system, is a top priority
across the Agency.
We have moved forward with an IT modernization project to improve our Department’s information
technology infrastructure. The need to modernize, develop technical and operational excellence in our
workforce is critical in enhancing our tax systems and the security of confidential taxpayer information.
FY 2017 was a year of ongoing transformation and growth for the Arizona Department of Revenue, but,
we know the journey is far from over on behalf of our customers, Arizona taxpayers. I am confident that
we are up to this challenge and totally committed to improving ADOR each day.

Bingo Collections

The tax on state licensed bingo operations is based on a multi-tiered licensing structure. There are three
classes of bingo licenses, each of which has a different tax rate.

Each licensee’s tax rate is based on bingo receipts. Class A licensees, whose gross receipts do not exceed
$15,600 per year, are taxed at 2.5 percent of adjusted gross receipts. (Adjusted gross receipts are the
monies left after paying prizes.) Class B and Class C licensees are also taxed on gross receipts. Class B
licensees, whose gross receipts do not exceed $300,000, are taxed at 1.5 percent of their gross receipts.
Class C licensees, whose gross receipts exceed $300,000 per year, are taxed at 2 percent of gross
receipts from bingo.

All taxes collected are deposited in the state general fund (Refer to Table 39).

Luxury Tax Collections

Arizona’s luxury tax applies to cigarettes, other tobacco products and alcoholic beverages. The
department is responsible for issuing tobacco licenses and stamps and collecting taxes on tobacco
products and alcoholic beverages. The department also investigates and confiscates contraband tobacco
products. As of August 2017, all tobacco filing payments, stamp orders and required reports are
performed 100 percent electronically.

Unclaimed Property Collections and Distributions

Responsibilities of the Unclaimed Property Unit include the collection, safekeeping and disposition of
abandoned property and escheated estates.

The Unclaimed Property staff receives and maintains records related to unclaimed funds along with
other intangible and tangible personal property that is presumed to be abandoned. This property is
received from business associations, banking and financial institutions, insurance companies, fiduciaries,
state courts and governmental agencies.

                                                                                             15 | P a g e
Common examples of unclaimed property are:

    •   State warrants not cashed after six months;
    •   Payroll checks written to employees not cashed after one year;
    •   Contents of safe deposit boxes on which rent has not been paid for three years;
    •   Government and Court property not claimed in two years;
    •   Stock or other equity interest in a business association or financial institution with no activity for
        three years;
    •   Bank or credit union accounts with no activity for three years;
    •   Cashier and other official checks not cashed in three years;
    •   Checks written to vendors or customers not cashed after three years;
    •   Money orders not cashed in three years;
    •   Traveler’s checks not cashed in fifteen years;
There is no statute of limitations for filing a claim for unclaimed property. Owners may recover their
property at any time with proper documentation.




ESCHEATED ESTATES

In addition to their Unclaimed Property responsibilities, staff members also establish and maintain
records of Escheated Estates. An Escheated Estate is created when a person dies without leaving a will
and has no known heirs. When this condition exists, his or her property reverts to the state as the
original and ultimate proprietor after seven years. Funds received from escheated estates are deposited
into the Permanent State School Fund. (Refer to Table 41.)




Waste Tire Fee Distributions

The Arizona waste tire fee is a fee applied to the sale of new motor vehicle tires. The fee is to be
collected quarterly at a rate of two percent of the purchase price not to exceed two dollars per tire.

During fiscal year 2017, the department collected $9,679,319 and distributed 3.5% to the Arizona
Department of Environmental Quality with the remainder being distributed to the counties based on the
number of motor vehicles registered in the county (Refer to Table 42).

The distribution is performed quarterly.
