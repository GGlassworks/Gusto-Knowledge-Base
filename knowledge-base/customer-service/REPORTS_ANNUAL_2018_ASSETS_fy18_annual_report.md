Director’s Message

The Arizona Department of Revenue’s (ADOR) Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Report showcases the agency’s
ongoing mission of Serving Taxpayers! A vision based on excellence in innovation, customer service and
continuous improvement.

I am very proud to report this past fiscal year saw 6.4 million tax documents processed and a record
$17.9 billion collected, which then went back into Arizona’s many programs and services.

Four main goals continued to guide ADOR last fiscal year: optimizing taxpayer services, accelerating
processing, maximizing taxpayer education and compliance, as well as supporting and championing the
agency.

By staying true to these overarching goals, the department’s dedicated staff found new ways to
eliminate waste and drive efficiencies, which resulted in a number of achievements that enhanced
customer service.

The Arizona Department of Revenue remains focused on customer service as it administers the State of
Arizona’s tax system. Through a forward-leaning approach, the department will continue to evolve as it
identifies new ways to deliver better, faster and more cost-effective service for Arizonans.

Miscellaneous Taxes

Bingo Collections

The tax on state licensed bingo operations is based on a multi-tiered licensing structure. There are three
classes of bingo licenses, each of which has a different tax rate.

Each licensee’s tax rate is based on bingo receipts. Class A licensees, whose gross receipts do not exceed
$15,600 per year, are taxed at 2.5 percent of adjusted gross receipts. (Adjusted gross receipts are the
monies left after paying prizes.) Class B and Class C licensees are also taxed on gross receipts. Class B
licensees, whose gross receipts do not exceed $300,000, are taxed at 1.5 percent of their gross receipts.
Class C licensees, whose gross receipts exceed $300,000 per year, are taxed at 2 percent of gross receipts
from bingo.

All taxes collected are deposited in the state general fund. (Refer to Table 40.)




                                                                                                             19 | Page
Miscellaneous Taxes

Luxury Tax Collections

Arizona’s luxury tax applies to cigarettes, other tobacco products and alcoholic beverages. The
department is responsible for issuing tobacco licenses and stamps and collecting taxes on tobacco
products and alcoholic beverages. The department also investigates and confiscates contraband tobacco
products. As of August 2017, all tobacco filing payments, stamp orders and required reports are
performed 100 percent electronically.

Unclaimed Property Collections and Distributions

Responsibilities of the Unclaimed Property Unit include the collection, safekeeping and disposition of
abandoned property and escheated estates.

The Unclaimed Property staff receives and maintains records related to unclaimed funds along with
other intangible and tangible personal property that is presumed to be abandoned. This property is
received from business associations, banking and financial institutions, insurance companies, fiduciaries,
state courts and governmental agencies.




                                                                                                              20 | Page
Common examples of unclaimed property are:

       State warrants not cashed after six months;
       Payroll checks written to employees not cashed after one year;
       Contents of safe deposit boxes on which rent has not been paid for three years;
       Government and Court property not claimed in two years;
       Stock or other equity interest in a business association or financial institution with no activity for
        three years;
       Bank or credit union accounts with no activity for three years;
       Cashier and other official checks not cashed in three years;
       Checks written to vendors or customers not cashed after three years;
       Money orders not cashed in three years;
       Traveler’s checks not cashed in fifteen years;
An owner may file a claim to recover property within thirty-five years after the final day of the fiscal year
in which the department received said property.




Escheated Estates

In addition to their Unclaimed Property responsibilities, staff members also establish and maintain
records of escheated estates. An escheated estate is created when a person dies without leaving a will
and has no known heirs. When this condition exists, his or her property reverts to the state as the
original and ultimate proprietor after seven years. Funds received from escheated estates are deposited
into the Permanent State School Fund. (Refer to Table 42.)




Waste Tire Fee Distributions

The Arizona waste tire fee is a fee applied to the sale of new motor vehicle tires. The fee is to be
collected quarterly at a rate of two percent of the purchase price not to exceed two dollars per tire.

During fiscal year 2018, the department collected $9,874,138 and distributed 3.5% to the Arizona
Department of Environmental Quality with the remainder being distributed to the counties based on the
number of motor vehicles registered in the county. (Refer to Table 43.)

The distribution is performed quarterly.
