Director’s Message

Fiscal year 2019 was another milestone year for the Arizona Department of Revenue (ADOR) as the
agency collected a record $19.3 billion, which was then distributed back to Arizona cities, towns and
counties, as well as the State General Fund. Fiscal year 2019’s record revenue collection surpassed the
$17.9 billion from fiscal year 2018.

Other key fiscal highlights from the Annual Report include the following:
   • More than 6.4 million tax documents were processed;
   • Over 2 million individual income tax refunds were issued to taxpayers; and
   • Collections from transaction privilege tax remained strong in 2018-2019 at $11.7 billion

The growth of electronic filing, which is more secure and more efficient, continued last fiscal year (FY)
with approximately 83 percent of the 3.4 million individual tax returns being e-filed. For this past tax
season, refunds from e-filed tax returns took an average of eight days to process compared to 23 days
for paper return refunds.

ADOR’s emphasis on increasing education and awareness among all tax types remained a priority with a
collaborative outreach program with municipal and county governments, as well as stakeholders across
Arizona. This partnership approach resulted in the continued growth in the number of tax education
workshops.

The Department of Revenue’s Unclaimed Property program again returned millions of dollars to the
rightful owners of these assets. In FY 2019, $48.4 million was given back to heirs of the property, many
unaware of the abandoned funds that the agency had been safeguarding.

Under our overarching mission of Serving Taxpayers!, ADOR’s positive revenue story could not have
been achieved without the dedicated efforts of Department of Revenue employees who continued to
eliminate waste and drive inefficiencies out of everyday processes, which are cornerstones of the
Arizona Management System’s commitment to delivering better, faster and more cost-effective service
for Arizonans.

With a vision based on excellence in innovation, customer service and continuous improvement the
Arizona Department of Revenue remains focused on responding to the ever-changing needs of our
customers as it administers the state’s comprehensive tax system.

Thank you,

Carlton Woodruff
Director

Miscellaneous Taxes

Bingo Collections

The tax on state licensed bingo operations is based on a multi-tiered licensing structure. There are three
classes of bingo licenses, each of which has a different tax rate.

Each licensee’s tax rate is based on bingo receipts. Class A licensees, whose gross receipts do not exceed
$15,600 per year, are taxed at 2.5 percent of adjusted gross receipts. (Adjusted gross receipts are the
monies left after paying prizes.) Class B and Class C licensees are also taxed on gross receipts. Class B
licensees, whose gross receipts do not exceed $300,000, are taxed at 1.5 percent of their gross receipts.
Class C licensees, whose gross receipts exceed $300,000 per year, are taxed at 2 percent of gross receipts
from bingo.

All taxes collected are deposited in the state general fund. (Refer to Table 40.)

Luxury Tax Collections

Arizona’s luxury tax applies to cigarettes, other tobacco products and alcoholic beverages. The
department is responsible for issuing tobacco licenses and stamps and collecting taxes on tobacco
products and alcoholic beverages. The department also investigates and confiscates contraband tobacco
products. As of August 2017, all tobacco filing payments, stamp orders and required reports are
performed 100 percent electronically.

                      Monies collected and distributed from luxury tax:

Unclaimed Property Collections and Distributions

Responsibilities of the Unclaimed Property Unit include the collection, safekeeping and disposition of
abandoned property and escheated estates.

The Unclaimed Property staff receives and maintains records related to unclaimed funds along with
other intangible and tangible personal property that is presumed to be abandoned. This property is
received from business associations, banking and financial institutions, insurance companies, fiduciaries,
state courts and governmental agencies.



Common examples of unclaimed property are:

    •   State warrants not cashed after six months;
    •   Payroll checks written to employees not cashed after one year;
    •   Contents of safe deposit boxes on which rent has not been paid for three years;
    •   Government and Court property not claimed in two years;
    •   Stock or other equity interest in a business association or financial institution with no activity for
        three years;
    •   Bank or credit union accounts with no activity for three years;
    •   Cashier and other official checks not cashed in three years;
    •   Checks written to vendors or customers not cashed after three years;
    •   Money orders not cashed in three years;
    •   Traveler’s checks not cashed in fifteen years.
An owner may file a claim to recover property within 35 years after the final day of the fiscal year in
which the department received said property.




Escheated Estates

In addition to their Unclaimed Property responsibilities, staff members also establish and maintain
records of escheated estates. An escheated estate is created when a person dies without leaving a will
and has no known heirs. When this condition exists, his or her property reverts to the state as the
original and ultimate proprietor after seven years. Funds received from escheated estates are deposited
into the Permanent State School Fund. (Refer to Table 42.)



                                                                                                           19
Waste Tire Fee Distributions

The Arizona waste tire fee is a fee applied to the sale of new motor vehicle tires. The fee is to be
collected quarterly at a rate of two percent of the purchase price not to exceed two dollars per tire.

During fiscal year 2019, the department collected $10,004,703 and distributed 3.5 percent to the
Arizona Department of Environmental Quality with the remainder being distributed to the counties
based on the number of motor vehicles registered in the county. (Refer to Table 43.)

The distribution is performed quarterly.
