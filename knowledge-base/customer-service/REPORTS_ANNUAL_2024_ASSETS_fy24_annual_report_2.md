 As the Legislature enacts new tax laws each session, ADOR must implement
 them accurately, efficiently, and within a concise time frame. Despite the often
 monumental requirements, this agency excelled at implementing the Arizona
 Family Tax Rebate. The Department issued over 739,000 rebates totaling
 approxiately $273,749,600. That puts money back into Arizona families’ pockets.

 ADOR is ready for another great year with our focus on providing excellent service
 to Arizona’s taxpayers and providing a rewarding workplace for our team members.
