1            COMPANY INFORMATION



1.1 Hire Quest History
Hire Quest was formed in June of 2002 with the combined assets of the predecessor, Productivity Partners
International, Inc., and its 2 subsidiaries, Productivity Partners Franchising, Inc. and Efficiency, Inc. They were
the outgrowth of a reorganization of several Florida corporations that were, directly or indirectly, franchisees of
Labor World, a competing temporary staffing company. The first group of Trojan Labor offices opened in 1999
as a successor of American Labor and Productivity Partners.

We improved our original expansion plan back in 2002 to handle rapid growth by placing proper controls to
ensure remote locations were operating according to our standards. We also redirected our efforts from com-
pany-owned offices to franchised outlets with owner-operators who have a vested interest in the success of their
business.

From 2003 to 2004, our revenue grew 51% after our branch acquisitions from Ready Staffing became fran-
chised, mostly to the very same Ready Staffing employees who ran them. In 2005, we implimented our own
“plug and play” branch operating software to all of our franchised branches. Franchise owners enjoyed record
profits as they were able to concentrate more on new sales and effortlessly expand into new markets. Hire Quest
was named in the Charleston Business Journal as the #3 fastest growing company in the region for 2005 and
looks forward to continued growth in the years to come.

1.2 HQ WebConnect
HQ WebConnect is our operating software developed in 2004 by Hire Quest LLC and an outside computer pro-
graming company. The easy-to-use branch operating software is crucial for the sales field to understand. Hire
Quest offers free training and ongoing support.

1.3 Industry Information
There is a large current demand for Temporary Labor since 90% of all companies use temporary help. And
the staffing industry is growing. In fact, U.S. staffing firms employed an average of 2.6 million temporary and
contract workers per day more in the first quarter of 2005 than in the same period last year. Because more and
more firms now restrict the number of full-time employees to a small core and include temps, part-timers, and
independent contractors in their strategic planning the industry will continue to grow.

Temporary staffing helps businesses meet challenging needs in a cost-effective way by enabling them to:
      • get help on short notice when emergencies arise or someone calls in sick
      • address fluctuations in their personnel needs
      • avoid having to use highly skilled employees for mundane but necessary work
      • hire the right person with the right skills for special needs when they arise
      • “try out” personnel on a short term, no commitment basis to see if that person fits 				
        into the company for a long-term or full time position.
      • avoid a lot of expensive and time consuming red tape by hiring personnel that have              		
        already been screened, trained, and pre-qualified.

1.4 Product Knowledge and Understanding
The industry has some good websites to look at periodically to keep up with the changing market that our com-
pany falls in. www.americanstaffing.net and www.sireport.com.

1.5 Glossary of Terms
Please review the Glossary of Terms most commonly used in the temporary staffing industry located in the Re-
source Guide.

1.6 What is Acrux and What is Trojan Labor?
Acrux and Trojan Labor are temporary staffing services specializing in providing temporary employees primar-
ily in the industrial sector throughout the United States. We provide temporary employees ranging from skilled
to semi-skilled to unskilled laborers to companies every day.

Acrux is a weekly or long-term assignment based office where employees typically range from semi-skilled to
skilled and are paid weekly. These employees are dispatched over the telephone after extensive interviewing
and confirmation of their skills and abilities.

Trojan Labor is a daily work, daily pay operation that typically has skilled, unskilled and general laborers avail-
able on a day-to-day basis. Orders placed with Trojan Labor between 5:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. are normally
filled within one hour. Trojan Labor employees are dispatched from the branch in person every day.

1.7 Why use temporary staffing?
When the cost of hiring and retaining permanent staff is broken down (see the components of cost below), ap-
proximately 55% beyond one permanent employee’s payroll is spent by the employer. In other words, it costs
prospect customers 155% of that permanent employee’s payroll to hire, retain, provide benefits for and pay one
employee. When companies use temporary staffing, they pay ONLY for time worked- no benefits, no pay-
roll taxes, no retention costs and no advertising costs. As the legal employer of temporary staff, Trojan Labor
handles and administrates all of these charges and cuts through all of the red tape for customers. Is there any
real surprise as to why companies are turning to temporary staffing? Moreover, what are the tangible and intan-
gible costs of providing poor customer service due to being understaffed? Trojan Labor helps customers meet
their deadlines and keep their customers satisfied.

1.9 Trojan Labor Guarantee
  1.     We will save the customer money: Salaries and wages are only a small part of the cost of recruiting and retaining an employee.
  We help manage costs because we are responsible for providing each of the items listed below to our employees. Other costs include
  workers compensation insurance, payroll taxes, vacation / holiday / sick days, training costs, cost of payroll processing, health insur-
  ance, advertising and recruiting, and regulatory compliance
  2.     We will enhance the customers productivity: We open our offices at 5:30 am to ensure that we have the people available to work
  for you when the customer needs them.
  3.     We will treat the customer like a partner: We will tailor our services to meet their needs, not ours. That means we can provide
  the customer with customized training, drug and alcohol testing, skill testing, background checks, or pretty much, whatever other
  services they may need.
  4.     The customer’s satisfaction is guaranteed: If the customer is displeased with one of our workers, they can just call our office and
  will not be charged. This is a guarantee they can’t get with their own staff and one we can make because we are confident our service
  is the best in the industry. We guarantee it!

1.10 Features and Benefits
Features are facts about our company that distinguish us from our competitors. Benefits give the Prospect
reason to buy from us. People buy because they are convinced that what you are offering is beneficial to them.
Through proper preparation and investigation, you will know which feature / benefits to present. What the
Prospect tells you during the sales call is not your only source of information. You may know of service prob-
lems with a competitor. This information is very important in addressing the Prospect’s unstated needs, and
reinforces the need for preparation. There are numerous features / benefits from which to choose. Below is a
partial list:
1.       Direct Dispatch
And this means to you, the customer… we see the Employees before they come to see you. We are reasonably
certain that, if they wake up and come to our office, they are interested in working for the day.
2.       Multiple Offices
And this means to you… we exchange proven service ideas between offices. Should you need help elsewhere
   |   sales manual

in the United States, your account is already established saving you time and money.
3.      Guarantee
And this means to you… if, for any reason, you are dissatisfied with one of our Employees; notify the office
within the first four hours and all charges will be cancelled. If possible, we will replace the Employee(s) imme-
diately. This is a guarantee of your satisfaction.
4.      Open at 5:30 a.m.
And this means to you… if you get to work at 7:00 a.m. and you find you are short-staffed, you can call our
office and get immediate response. No waiting until 8:00 or 9:00 a.m. for the office to open and then get on the
telephone to recruit. The Employees are here and ready to go.
5.      Temp-to-Perm
And this means to you… that you can “try before you buy.” If you need to fill a permanent position, you can
work the employee through us for an agreed upon period of time, then, after you know the working and atten-
dance habits, go ahead and make the permanent hire.
6.      Pre-training
And this means to you… that we will help minimize the traditional “ramp up” time for new hires by pre-train-
ing employees before they get to the job site. This may take many forms using the customer safety videotapes,
to written forms where the employee reads rules, etc., and then signs off.
7.      Pay Only for Hours Worked
And this means to you… that, when factors like vacations, holiday pay, break time, and sick pay are included,
you are paying full-time employees for nonproductive time. When calling us, you pay only for hours worked,
saving you money.
8.      Satellite Offices
And this means to you… our service capabilities afford you not only convenience, but timesaving. We have
recruiting advantages, drawing from several different areas.
9.      Delivery of Temporary Employees
And this means to you… that your Employees will be where you want them, when you want them.
10.      24 Hour Service
And this means to you… if you have a three-shift operation, that we will provide you Employees for all three
shifts.
The features / benefits list can be added to continually. Features are the basis from which you construct benefits.
A feature becomes a benefit when you answer the question, “What does that mean to me?”

1.11 Competition
Knowing your competition is very important in the staffing industry. Using the local phone book’s Yellow
Pages and searching for company web sites are two ways to familiarize yourself with competition locally and
nationally. Calling the competition and learning their pay rates and bill rates is also highly recommended.

1.12 The Sales Connection and The Trojan Star
Hire Quest isses two newsletters throughout the year. The Sales Connection is designed to help sales people un-
derstand different aspects of the business and to create new ideas for sales campanies in all offices. The Trojan
Star is the quarterly company newsletter that brings news and upcoming events to each office from Hire Quest.

1.13 Web Sites
Our websites are designed for customers as well as our own staff. www.trojanlabor.com and www.acruxstaff-
ing.com have explanations of the services we offer and directories of locations for potential customers to view.
The Customer Web Portal is available for current customers to access their invoices and a lot more via the
internet. www.hirequestllc.com is designed to explain our franchise model along with an extensive internal use
section for branch staff to use at their convenience.

2            OPERATIONS



2.1 Daily Operations and Office Assistance
Trojan Labor’s open office hours are 5:30 AM to 6:00 PM. Understanding how the office runs is important
to know. You may refer to the Operations Manual in the office to learn more about how the Dispatching and
Payout processes are done. Observing daily operations of your office is also an important step in training as an
effective sales reprensentative since this knowledge can be the make or break in differentiating our company
from the competition for a potential customer. Assisting in the office may also be one of your job responsibili-
ties as a sales representative.

2.2 Quality of Workers
As you observe operations of Trojan Labor, you will soon realize that the product you are selling (temporary
employees) is what it is. It is very important to remember not to oversell this product, by making unobtainable
promises. It is also important to remember that non-skilled work is our niche. Semi-Skilled and Skilled labor is
more difficult to fill orders and collect payment.

Additionally, Trojan Labor does not initially screen employees- our screening is based on the employee’s past
history with our company. Drug Testing, Background Checks, and Skill testing can be done upon request by the
customer after it has been established who will be responsible for the cost.

2.3 Recruiting
Recruting is another important aspect of our business. Ideally, sales representatives should make 1 to 2 recruit-
ing calls each day in order to support the new sales you are bringing into the office.

2.4 Workers Compensation
Workers Compensation is part of the cost of employment. The workers comp code assigned and the rate as-
sociated with the code effect the overall profit received for each customer. You can use the SCOPES manual to
assign correct comp codes to each customer based on their main source of business. There are some restricted
codes that our insurance carrier has prohibited service in. Please see Apendix B for restricted and prohibited
workers comp codes.

Since we value saftey of our jobs very highly, Jobsite Inspections should be done on all new accounts. Addi-
tional safety procedures are discussed on our website and in our Resource Guide to promote safety.

2.5 New Customers or Jobsites
Upon the order for a new customer or jobsite, it is important to get directions to the job and obtain a customer
map for the dispatcher.

On the first day of service, sales representatives should make contact with the customer either by a personal visit
or a phone call to ensure all of their expectations were met by our company. Be there within the first 4 hours
to confirm good service! A happy customer will continue to use when they have needs, whereas a dissatisfied
customer will not only stop our service, but may also be troublesome to collect payment from.

2.6 Payrolling Systerm
Various types of business can be valid prospects for the Payrolling system. Reasons for utilizing payroll
services vary from the desire to avoid collective bargaining agreements to probationary periods prior to
hire, and many times generally considered to be high turnover, no benefits with low wages. Businesses
with large swings in hiring due to seasonal jobs are also prime candidates for the payroll system.
Before pricing can be addressed and a presentation of our proposal made, the prospect must first be
qualified. This is a good time to read the sales qualification section of your sales manual as the process is
very similar. This phase of the sales process is devoted to learning about the prospect and his business.

Trojan Labor does not wish to assume collection risks, and therefore requires certain minimums to be
met in order to qualify for the Payrolling system.
> A minimum of 800 payroll hours or $5,000.00 payroll dollars weekly
> The customer must also be prepared to “Exchange” checks- one check from the customer covering the
payroll plus the service charge in exchange for the employee payroll checks. This can be accomplished
through direct transfer of funds from the customer to Trojan Labor accounts.

During the qualification you will gather information which will allow Trojan Labor to present the best
possible approach to secure the business. The payrolling system does not include activities or cost of
advertising, screening, testing, dispatching, processing of daily payroll, etc. With the “Payrolling system,
we simply write payroll checks for employees who have been recruited, screened and found acceptable
by the customer. The “Payrolling” customer has both the job and the individual to do perform the task.
Since all we do is write the payroll for the employees, we can perform this service for less than our stan-
dard markup provided that there are no unusual circumstances or hazards.
The pricing will be approved by the Branch Manager prior to presenting a proposal, and will take into
account the following variables:
>Risk Management--our exposure to workers compensation liability. If Trojan Labor assumes the
employer responsibilities of a high risk or unsafe portion of a company’s payroll, the problem becomes
ours.
>Our pricing costs consist of state unemployment, federal unemployment, workers compensation, FICA,
liability insurance and our service charge.
All this must be considered before determining a rate. Our service charge takes into account the custom-
er requirements stated during the qualification process, and translating that into the amount of work that
will be require to service their needs. Other considerations are the number of locations to be serviced,
required payroll reports, requested turnaround time, and the represented volume of business. After a total
rate is determined our price quote is always a percentage of payroll and never an hourly rate.

Once all the facts are gathered, and pricing is determined, the Branch Manager or Staffing Consultant
will be ready to present our proposal. It would again be prudent to review the sales manual section
entitled “Making The Presentation”. At this time we present not only our proposed rate, but must also
address the prospect concerns and overcome any objections raised. The customer has much to gain with
the payrolling system. Almost every firm that uses our payrolling system does so for one and mostly
more than one of the following reasons. For all employees under the system, the customer pays no fringe
benefits, ie: vacations, sick days, retirement or profit sharing benefits. It provides the customer a means
of retaining loyal and valuable employees after compulsory retirement. Out of city/state companies
that have a short term job in the area where they don’t want to set up payroll procedures and become
involved with worker compensation, state unemployment and liability insurance are prime candidates
for Payrolling. Perhaps a company has an individual they want to hire for a temporary assignment, but
company policy prevents hiring additional personnel on a permanent basis, for a short period of time.
We are therefore asked to place the individual on our payroll. It may well be that the addition of one ore
        	                                                                                         | 13

more employees to the staff of a firm will require that firm to begin making unemployment compensation pay-
ments for the employee. In some states when a firm has less than four employees it does not have to make these
payments. In order to keep away from these payments and the handling of related unemployment claims reports,
our Payrolling System may be considered. Some forms are not licensed to do business in a particular state and
Trojan Labor may be. Perhaps it would allow us to payroll their employees. Even the employment of a single
individual in a state can require a great deal of reporting to various state agencies and departments.
At this time it is valuable to complete a payroll cost analysis sheet which will actually show the prospect what
he/she is now spending to process the payroll. With this in hand closing will be easy. When presenting, it is vital
that the persons in attendance are in fact the decision makers. With few exceptions, a formal presentation is
conducted within the structure of an appointment call. When setting the appointment, gain assurance the parties
that make the decision will at the meeting. Only with them in attendance, will the closing or obtaining a com-
mitment be possible. If all of the preparations have been completed, closing will be the easiest part of the sales
process.
At closing we need to explain our service agreement and the pertinent schedules attached. We are getting the
customers’ commitment to fulfill his/her end of the deal, and will actually need to sign the service agreement
and which delineates the billing rate percentage.

2.7 Service Calls
Service calls are personal visits or phone calls to an already existing customer. Don’t ignore them after making
the sale. Routined service calls should be made as follows:




2.8 Calculating a Bill Rate
Discussion of Direct Costs:
Average Direct expenses we incur as a percentage of payroll:
        Social Security			                  7.65%
        State Unemployment			               2.70% (approximate number)
        Federal Unemployment		              0.80%
        Workman’s Compensation		            7.00% (approximate number)
        Liability Insurance			              0.50%
        Royalties			                      +13.00% (8% of sales)
        TOTAL			                           31.65%
		              (Pay Rate) X 1.3165 = Direct Costs
The above shows that on the average a 31.65% markup in order to cover direct costs. This is sometimes re-
ferred to as your “Burden.”
14 |   sales manual

EXAMPLE:
Assume that the Bill Rate is $9/hr and Pay rate is $6/hr, the total Burden (Direct Costs) is $7.89. This leaves
$1.11/hr or 12.33% of the bill rate as the profit contribution to cover fixed expenses.

Discussion of Markup vs. Margin
There are two types of ways to quote bill rates for potential customers.

Markup is the additional amount added to a bill rate to cover overhead, profit, excess costs, etc. With Mark-
ups the base is always equal to 100 percent of payroll + burden + a minimal of 10% profit contribution.
* Markup is calculated by: Bill Rate / Pay Rate = Markup

Margin is the difference between net sales and the cost of goods sold, expressed as a percentage of net sales.
Gross Profit Margins should be in the range of 36-45% for an average sale.
       * Margin is calculated by: [(Bill Rate) – (Pay Rate)] / (Bill Rate) = Gross Profit Margin

WARNING: a 35% markup is not the same as a 35% margin! Be careful when discussing markup and margins
with prospects to ensure you are both talking about the same thing.

EXAMPLE:
Assume that the Bill Rate is $10 and Pay Rate is $6, and a burden of 31.65% of payroll, then:

      $10 / $6 = 66.66% Markup
      66.66% Markup - 31.65% burden= 35.01% Profit Contribution
      ($10 - $6) /$10 = 40.00% Gross Profit Margin		
						                                          			
EXAMPLE
Assume that the Bill Rate is $9 and Pay Rate is $6, then the Markup is 50% and the Gross Profit Margin is
33.33%. This margin is unacceptable if we want to realize a significant profit.

2.8 Collections
Collections is another very important aspect of the temporary labor industry. When landing an account, it is
imporartant that the potential customer understands and agrees to the bill rate, the skill level, and overtime com-
pensation. Sample Collection Letters to help in the collection process can be viewed in Apendix C.

3            SALES



3.1 Six Points to Every Sale
In the sales process, six steps should be taken whether selling a commodity, product or service:

A.     Preparation
B.     Introduction / Rapport
C.     Investigation
D.     Features / Benefits
E.     Close
F.     Follow-up

Let us explore each of these independently.

A. Preparation
It has been said that a successful sales interview is ninety-percent preparation. Teddy Roosevelt cautioned
friends that the only sure way to overcome trouble is to be ready for it. Boston sales executive George C. Ran-
dolph agrees. “In selling,” he says, “the highest reward goes to the persistent planner.”

Being prepared before a sales call means several things. It means having your business card and collateral
materials ready. It means having something on which to write or to take notes. It can mean that you know
something about the company where you are calling. For example, if you are calling on Colgate-Palmolive, you
know that they manufacture toothpaste and soaps. You will know by looking at the facility if there is a ware-
house. You may see many, many truck dock doors. You may note that there are hundreds of cars in the parking
lot, indicating a large employment base. The company sign may tell you something about what the company
does. For example, “Robert Bosch Company - Brake Shoe Component Facility”.

If you can answer, “yes,” to the following questions, you are likely prepared when you make the sales call:

•      Do you always have a well-defined idea of the Prospect’s specific needs in advance?
•      Do you know exactly what you will do and say to respond to those needs?
•      Are you familiar with your competitor’s qualifications and counter-response?
•      Do you anticipate possible Prospect objections and know how you will reply in response?
•      Do you try to get as much information about Prospects as you can ahead of time?
•      Do you have a plan to help sustain interest during the course of the interview?
•      Do you always pinpoint the Prospect decision-maker?
•      Do you usually have a good idea how and when you will close the sale?

So you see preparation can take on many meanings. The simple fact is that you must be prepared, and set an
objective for the call before you enter the building or site. The objective can be very simple, such as “I am go-
ing to find out who orders extra help when they need it,” or “I am going to find out what they do here.” Setting
a simple objective will help you get past the rejection that is a natural part of any sales experience. You can feel
good about accomplishing your simple objective, even if the rest of the call goes poorly.
18 |   sales manual

B. Introduction / Rapport
When making the sales call, you will most likely not see the decision-maker right off the bat. There could be a
receptionist, a switchboard operator (in the case of telephone calls), or possibly an intercom. After a pleasant
greeting, clearly state who you are, the nature of our business and your purpose for the call.
        “Good afternoon, my name is Mary Wilson, with Trojan Labor.  We supply temporary personnel.”
This would be a good start to any sales call. You can then move toward building rapport with a friendly com-
ment.
        “I can’t believe how good that soap smells.  Is that from the manufacturing process here?”
You are building rapport as well as beginning to get into the investigative part of the call.
        “Can you tell me who is responsible for ordering the temporary help for the plant?”
This is the logical next question, and may be changed to suit the circumstance. For example:
        “Can you tell me who is responsible for calling for extra people when your production peaks?”
There are literally hundreds of questions you may ask, but in this portion of the call process, get to the decision
maker and/or ask for a business card so you will be prepared for your follow up with good information!

1.      Collateral Materials
Many times, you may utilize a collateral piece to visually reinforce your feature / benefit statement. Available
collateral pieces include:

•      Scratch Pads
•      Carpenter Pencils
•      Ink Pens
•      Brochures
•      Testimonial Letters
•      Lists of Customers
•      Cost Worksheet

You may wish to use only one piece per call, leaving you a reason to recall. Remember that it is always wise
to have a reason to recall a Prospect. Recognize that their time is valuable. Do not make the mistake of say-
ing, “I just stopped by…” Rather, “I came by today to tell you about…” Having a handout will often give you a
reason to call. Perhaps there has been something about our industry in the newspapers, or something about the
Prospect’s business. You may have a copy of your newspaper-recruiting ad to show them, or perhaps simply a
copy of your time ticket.

2.     Mailers
Adding letters, postcards and other mailers to the sales campaign completes the process. A regular campaign
of a personal call, mailer, and telephone call - on a regular frequency will generate sales fastest. You can form
your own database of prospects and customers or purchase labels from a commercial source, such as American
Business Information, available on the internet at listbazaar.com.

C. Investigation
Once you know who is responsible for making the decisions about who to call for industrial temporary Employ-
ees, attempt to see that individual. You may have to set an appointment. If so, try to set the appointment while
you are at the facility rather than having to make a call back by telephone. Remember to be prepared, and have
your calendar so you can make the appointment and keep it!

Face-to-face sales are always the best. You may make an occasional sale by telephone, but most of our sales are
generated by personal calls. People buy from people they trust, and they buy from people they like. It is easier
for them to believe what you say and to trust you can deliver on what you say if they look you in the eyes as
        	                                                                                         | 19

they hear you say it.

Questioning techniques will evolve over your life in sales. It is generally believed that one should always ask
open-ended questions, beginning with general questions (e.g., “This is a large plant. Are there other facilities
like this in the United States?”), then leading toward more direct, specific needs questions (e.g., “Can you tell
me about how many temporary Employees you use to staff this line?”). During this process, you will determine
if the Prospect uses temporary labor, why they use, when they use, etc. The good questions to ask in this phase
are those which answer the questions: Who? What? When? Where? Why?

Ninety-percent of your time should be spent LISTENING. Ask the questions and be prepared to take notes as
the Prospect answers. Always ask permission to take notes. This shows you are interested in what the Prospect
says, and implies that you think the responses are important. If you ask the proper questions, the answers will
provide the information you will need to proceed with the sales.

Overcoming Objections
You will most likely encounter objections during this part of the sale process. Handling objections can be con-
fusing. If you are not careful, you may be caught up in “countering” your Prospect’s objections and end up in
an argument! Obviously, this is not a great way to start a business relationship. One way to avoid the confusion
is to follow a simple, organized process for overcoming objections.

1.     Restate the Objection
2.     Clarification
3.     Feature / Benefit
4.     Acceptance

1.      Restate the Objection
This is the simplest step. It follows along with the rapport stage. Repeat what your Prospect said to you.
Prospect:      “Temporaries are all alike”
You:           “Temporaries are all alike?  Or “All alike?”
Restate what the Prospect has said. If you repeat it in question form, you will force him to respond to your
question, and perhaps hint at the real, hidden objection.

2.       Clarification
This is where we sometimes run into trouble. We actually assume that the first objection stated is the true objec-
tion. Most often, it is not. There are many reasons why your Prospect may avoid the real objection. Perhaps he
is loyal to his current supplier and is just interested in putting you off and getting you out the door. When you
clarify the objection, you make sure that you understand what the true objection actually is. You can to this by
asking him if there are any other objections. Simply ask, “Anything else?”

You may end up with several objections. In order to get to the true objection, you must ask the Prospect to pri-
oritize his concerns.
You: “You have given me a few reasons why you would no use temporaries.  Can you tell me what the biggest
reason is?  Really, what is the bottom line as to why, above all else, you would not use temporaries?”
Prospect:  “Because I do not know why I should pay more money for one of your people.  They are more expen-
sive.”

Unless the Prospect returns to previous objections or brings up new ones, you can assume that you have deter-
mined the true objection.
You: “Do you feel that temps are too costly compared to your full-time people or your part-time people?”
Prospect:      “To my core staff of employees.”
20 |   sales manual

You have clarified that your Prospect is concerned that temporary Employees cost more than do full-time em-
ployees. Now is the time to handle the objection with a feature / benefit statement.

3.      Feature / Benefit
Once you have identified the true objection, you then move to the feature / benefit statement.
You: “When you call us, you pay only for hour worked.  When you factor in vacations, time off for breaks,
sick days, etc., you can see that calling us for those short term needs would actually save you money.”
Remember that a feature is something unique about us. A benefit answers for the Prospect the question, “And
that feature means to me…?”An example would be:

Feature: We open at 5:30 a.m.      That begs the question, “What does that mean to me?”
Benefit: We dispatch Employee by 6:00 a.m. so they can be to your location, ready to work by 7:00 a.m.

Always use a feature about us that meets the Prospect’s true objection. Then, continue with the benefit state-
ment.

There are perhaps ten common objections to overcome. Treat objections as questions and you will find them
much easier to deal with. For example, you may hear, “All temporary help is the same.” You could rephrase
that to read, “How are you different from all the others?” Turning an objection into a question is a valuable
exercise, one that should be practiced frequently in role-plays. The most common objections are:

•      You are all alike.
•      We are satisfied with our current service.
•      I am not happy with the quality of temporary help.
•      Your price is too high.
•      We work our people overtime when we need more production.
•      We only have a few employees.
•      We do not have much business and are cutting back.
•      Your service costs more than does XYZ Temps.
•      I have had bad results with your company before.
•      I have to order ten to get five who will show up.

You must deal with objections as they arise. It takes practice to become skillful in overcoming objections and
is, therefore, important that you are able to view the objections as questions and work through role plays when-
ever possible.

4.      Acceptance
Once the feature / benefit statements are presented, you must gain acceptance from the Prospect that what you
have said is agreeable. Does the Prospect acknowledge or believe what you said is true? Do they accept that
we can meet or exceed their temporary labor needs? Without this acceptance, you chances of getting the order
are slim. A good call will have balance of content. You want to avoid overuse of questions or agreement state-
ments, and allow the Prospect to say, “yes,” and give you the order.

A couple of cautions! The first is this: questions might appear to be objections, but most questions need to be
handled as questions. That is, answer them. Never delay answering a question or your Prospect may become
defensive. Second, if you are put off by a Prospect who has made an appointment to see you, simply suggest
another time. This is not an objection. Third, watch for Prospects who like to vent their philosophies on life
and our industry. They like to ramble on and on to anyone who will listen.

This four-step process of handling objections is a communication too! Your biggest task is to continually ask
           	                                                                                         | 21

questions to pull out of your Prospect their true feelings, needs, wants, and desires. If you are doing most of the
talking, then you are not listening nor asking enough questions.

D.      Feature / Benefit
The fourth step in the sales process is a series of feature / benefit statements that respond to the Prospect’s stated
objections. It is best to stick to the facts and address how you can get the job done. This step cannot be taken
until you have a thorough understanding of the Prospect’s needs. It is not necessary to bring up every feature
you can think of if that feature does not directly impact the Prospect. FEATURES ARE FACTS ABOUT OUR
COMPANY THAT DISTINGUISH US FROM OUR COMPETITORS. BENEFITS GIVE THE PROSPECT
REASON TO BUY FROM US. See Chapter One for more Features/Benefits.

People buy because they are convinced that what you are offering is beneficial to them. Through proper prepa-
ration and investigation, you will know which feature / benefits to present. What the Prospect tells you during
the sales call is not your only source of information. You may know of service problems with a competitor.
This information is very important in addressing the Prospect’s unstated needs, and reinforces the need for
preparation. There are numerous features / benefits from which to choose.

The features / benefits list in chapter one can be added to continually. Features are the basis from which you
construct benefits. A feature becomes a benefit when you answer the question, “What does that mean to me?”

E. Close
The fifth step in the sales process is the close - getting the order. This is perhaps the most difficult part of the
sales process for “rookies.” Knowing when to stop selling and ask for the order takes training and experience.
Objections can actually be buying signs. If a Prospect asks questions about your service, attempt to close. Any
sign of interest can be interpreted as a buying sign and you should take advantage of the situation to ask for the
order. There are many different methods of closing. However, most closes have at least two core elements:

•      Summary of features / benefits that relate to the Prospect’s needs
•      Ask for the order

Until you learn to ask for the order, your chances for success are diminished. Asking for the order can take the
form of a direct, closed-ended question. For example:

       “Can I send you one person at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow?”
Alternatively, you can try the presumptive close in which you state your close more like this:
       “Would it be better for our person to start this Monday, or next?”

You will choose the closing style with which you are most comfortable. In closing, remember: if at first you do
not succeed, try, try again! Ask for the order, ask again, and ask again!

F.       Follow-up
Follow-up is the final piece in the sales process. Follow-up or lack thereof can be the difference between get-
ting the order, and being shut out. Follow-up must be carefully planned, and it should build upon the positive
aspects of the call. As stated earlier, have a reason to call back, to follow-up. You may choose to use the first
call as an informal, information gathering call, with a defined call back scheduled. Alternatively, the Prospect
may ask a question that requires some research on your part. With a valid reason for the follow-up, you will
find the Prospect receptive and more open to what you have to present.
22 |   sales manual

Before leaving your call, set a specific time and date for follow-up. Even if the Prospect states that he/she is
happy with a current supplier, you might say:
“In today’s competitive business world, it is important for us all to keep our options open.  Sometimes things
beyond our control change and you may need to have an additional or alternate supplier.  I would like to stay
in touch with you monthly, for five minutes or so, to let you know of changes within our organization.  Can I do
that?”

If a Prospect tells you that he/she will call you next need, follow-up, and remind him of that. You could use a
pump call to say:

“When we met, you mentioned that you would call for your next need.  We have several Employees who meet
your qualifications here now.  Can I send you one?”

Many times, you will not be able to see the decision-maker on your first call. A telephone call to set an appoint-
ment may be required. Persistence is the key to contacting your Prospect. When you do go out on a recall,
begin the call with a recap of the previous call. This will show the Prospect that you are genuinely interested
in his business, that you paid attention. Psychologically, this is a positive buying influence. It shows that you
care.

Once you have the order, the sale begins. You must nurture that new Customer as you would a newly planted
fruit tree. The tree needs water, fertilizer, light and care. It occasionally will have broken branches or bruised
fruit, just as you may occasionally have a “bad apple” in your group of temporary Employees. After all, people
are people. They will let you down from time to time. However, as long as you are honest with your customers
- honest about the quality, numbers, availability and response time - you will foster long-term relationships.

FOLLOW-UP IS IMPORTANT. ACCORDING TO AN UNKNOWN SOURCE 80% OF SALES ARE MADE
AFTER THE FIFTH CALL BUT 80% OF SALESPEOPLE QUIT AFTER THE SECOND CALL!

3.2 Telephone Etiquette and Procedure
The telephone is an important point of contact. There is more business done via the telephone than is done face
to face. Good telephone etiquette and communication skills are habits of customer service experts and success-
ful businesses.

A.    Answer the phone promptly
Answer the phone within three rings. If the phone rings any longer the perception may be:

•      If they can’t pick up the phone on time, how can they service my account in a timely manner?
•      They must be so understaffed that they would be incapable of handling my needs.
•      This company obviously does not care about my business.
•      Is this company still in business?

1.     Your Greeting
Your greeting is the entry point to your business. Remember these basics; state the company name and your
name; ask how you may help.

Example: “Good afternoon, Trojan Labor, this is Joe. How may I help you?”

2.     Putting Someone on Hold
How we put a customer on hold is very important. We do not want to upset them, or make them feel unimport-
ant. Use the following basic rules when putting someone on hold:
        	                                                                                          | 23

•      Explain to customers why you need to put them on hold.
•      Give a time frame for how long they will be on hold.
•      Ask customers if you may put them on hold
•      Wait for a response.

3.     Transferring a Call
As with putting a customer on hold, there are basic rules to follow when transferring a customer.
•      Explain why the caller is being transferred and to whom.
•      Ask the customer if they want to be transferred.
•      Make sure someone is there to pick up the call before you hang up.
•      Tell the person to whom you are transferring the call.

Trojan Labor/Acrux is one of the very few temporary labor services in this area that performs a selection pro-
cess when filling your orders. Our unique system allows us to send you the best person we can find – not the
first person we find with the required skills. Do you see where this selection process can dramatically improve
the quality of the workers you receive?

Quality is the basis of Trojan Labor/Acrux’s reputation for excellence. Our quality control system begins when
an applicant registers with us and continues throughout their employment with us. Trojan Labor/Acrux can fill
orders more consistently because we have one of the largest applicant pools available. We have offices strategi-
cally located in ______________ and______________. This alone makes us very qualified to fill your tempo-
rary needs. Wouldn’t you agree?

Our service is outstanding – and hearing everything you‘ve said today – that would be important to you
– wouldn’t it? As one of the largest temporary labor services in ______________, we can provide you with the
kind of quality service you deserve. Do you have any questions about Trojan Labor/Acrux’s ability to supply
you with dependable workers?

I want you to understand that our overall goal is to become your primary supplier, and we want to earn you con-
fidence. In order to do that, I would like to start working on an order for you right away.

You are comfortable that we provide you with some unique services that your current supplier can’t aren’t you?

       IF YES: I will be calling you on ________ to secure your orders for next week – will morning or after-
noon be better for you?
       IF NO: We have agreed that Trojan Labor/Acrux can supply you with quality temps quickly and that we
provide some special services to our clients – yet you still seem hesitant – is there something we didn’t cover?

        IF NO: Let me suggest the following. Isn’t it your intention to secure the best services available for
your company, and it is always in the best interest of your company to upgrade the quality of your suppliers. I
believe the most profitable action in this situation would be to set up a comparison between Trojan Labor/Acrux
and your present temp service by alternating orders during the next 90 days. Having your current service send-
ing the best workers they have available, which they will because they are being evaluated, and us sending our
best workers for every order would certainly benefit you, don’t you agree? How many workers do you need this
week?

3.4 Territory Management
Since, time is a salesperson’s most valuable asset, territory management is crucial. Lost hours mean lost sales
and lower earnings. Poor territory management leads to missed opportunities and meager results. The appropri-
ate alignment of sales resources across well-defined territories is the key to peak efficiency in any sales opera-
tion. Territory management allows you to structure your daily sales effort into territories. You can optimize
        	                                                                                       | 25

4            SALES MATERIAL & FORMS



4.1 Credit/Customer Application
As seen below, this agreement is to be completed by any potential client for agreement upon bill rates and to
perform any sort of credit or background check before doing business with any given customer. Please see Ap-
endix D for a copy of the Customer Application.

4.2 Sales Brochure
See Apendix E for a sample sales brochure.

4.3 Business Cards
Upon being hired, business cards should be ordered by your superior. Your business card should include the lo-
cal branch information in addition to your e-mail address and other contact information.

4.4 Marketing Giveaways
In our business, the most commonly used marketing giveaways are the Trojan Labor scratch pads and carpenter
pencils. Other giveaways are ordered on an as needed and per request basis.

4.5 Work Orders
Sales reps often take work orders while they are talking to
new customers who are ready to use Trojan Labor. The pa-
per that is used can be seen to the right. This form helps to
ask all of the necessary information that the dispatcher will
need in order to meet all of the customers expectations.

4.6 Car Box
As a sales representative, you will learn that it is wise to
always be prepared to present your company to a poten-
tial customer. The idea of a car box is to keep a supply of
Customer Applications, sales brochures, business cards,
marketing giveaways, and work orders in you car for those
unexpected sales calls. It is also a good idea to include a
hard hat to put on when approaching some jobsites and a
sales call sheet to record any notes on for these stops.

4.7 Sample Letters
Hire Quest has devoloped a group of sample sales and col-
lection letters to help assist branches in sending anything
from thank you notes to final warning letters for non-pay-
ment. A sample proposal is also included in the sales let-
ters. These are located in Apendix F.

5            REPORTING REQUIREMENTS




5.1 Daily Sales Activity Reporting
The Daily Sales Activity Reprot was designed to help sales representatives keep track of their sales made on a
daily basis. Each sales and service call should be recorded on this form as a record of what sales activity has
been accomplished on any given day for both the sales representative and the branch manager to refer to at any
given time. A copy of this report should be turned in to the branch manager on a regular basis.

Hire Quest and Trojan Labor staff have developed a few alternative reports for sales representatives to use for
recording their daily sales activity.
        • The Cold Call Report is merely a place to record customer information and notes throughout each day.
        • The Detailed Daily Sales Report is a more detailed way to track daily sales activity. This report is
        designed to help you ask all the necessary questions of a first visit cold call.
        • The Daily Sales Report to Manager (or something similar) may be a requirement in your office for
        management to track your daily activity simply by number of calls made each day and actual sales
        made.

5.2 Top 50 Prospects
The idea of keeping a Top 50 Prospects is something to consider and or may be required in your office as well.
The list should be constantly changing as a result of multiple visits to prospects. Prospects who are more likely
to use a large volume should be high on the list, while smaller prospects who are less likely to use should be low
on the list. Updating this list is a good practice to keeping and following up with good leads each week.

5.3 Customer/Prospect File
The Customer/Prospect File is a paper filing system used to keep track of customers and prospects in a note-
book. A separate form is filled out for each customer/prospect with contact information and any notes pertain-
ing to the contact. There are several computer programs that work in this same manner.

5.4 ACT Database
The ACT! database software is the most commonly used computer software within Trojan Labor and Acrux
Staffing. It serves the same point as the Customer/Profile files only it is digital. It also has additional schedul-
ing features to make setting and keeping appointments simple.

5.5 Sales Meetings
It is wise to meet on a regular basis with the branch manager to review sales progress and critique. The fre-
quency of these meetings may vary in different locations, but the objective of improving sales should always be
the end goal.

**All reports mentioned in this section may be viewed in Apendix G.

RE: Invoices ___________________ Total Due _______________


Dear Mr. Doe:

When your account with us was opened, we agreed to provide quality temporaries and you agreed to our
payment terms Net Due Upon Receipt. We ask for payment upon receipt of the invoice for the simple
reason that our temporary employees are paid up to two weeks before you receive your first bill for their
services. We have kept our part of the agreement. Why haven’t you kept yours?

The amount shown above is still carried as open on our records. We have made every effort to service
your needs in seeing that the bill is correct.

(Outline prior contact, attaching copies where needed and being sure to note the dates of calls, etc.)
Service Calls
Copies sent or hand delivered
Corrected invoices delivered and confirmed as correct
Phone Calls
Etc.

We are concerned about your lack of response to our requests for payment and would truly like to know
how to reach a mutually satisfactory solution. Please send your full remittance by return mail, tell us
when we may stop by and pick up a check, or contact us to explain what has delayed payment of this
seriously past due amount.

We look forward to hearing from you within the next week.

Sincerely,

Mr. Jones
Trojan Labor

________________________________________________________________
Under order given by: _______________________________________________
Florida law describes the serving of this notice and restricts your right to make payments under your
contract in accordance with section 713.06 and 255.05, Florida statutes. If there is a payment bond,
then this notice will advise you that we intend to look to the applicable payment bond for payment of
the foregoing items. Within ten (10) days of receipt of this notice, you are required by Florida Statutes
Section 713.23 and 255.05 to furnish notice of the existence of such payment bond and a copy of said
bond. Please note: This is not a lien, cloud, nor encumbrance upon title to your property, nor is it a

Important information for your protection
Under Florida laws, those who provide materials or work on your property and are not paid have a
right to file their claim for payment against your property. This claim is know as a Construction Lien.
If your contractor fails to pay sub contractors or material suppliers or neglects to make other legally
required payments, the people who are owed money may look to your property for payment even if you
have paid your contractor in full.
Protect yourself
Recognize that this Notice To Owner may result in a lien against your property unless all those supply-
ing a Notice To Owner have been paid. Learn more about the Construction Lien Law, Chapter 713, Part
1 Florida Statutes, and the meaning of this notice by contacting an attorney or the Florida Department
of Agriculture & Consumer Services, Division of Consumer Services.

Dear Mr./Ms./Mrs. __________:

As you know from your past experience with Trojan Labor, unfilled orders are an exception. Our goal is
to meet all the servicing needs of our customers on a continuing basis. However, if we cannot fill your
assignment with a qualified individual, we prefer not to send anyone at all. We don’t sacrifice quality
just to secure an order.

At Trojan Labor, we take pride in providing dependable temporary employees to all of our customers.
Unfortunately, at the time you placed your order, we were unable to find an employee with the qualifica-
tions you requested and we did not feel that it would be in your best interest to send a candidate that was
under-qualified.

We look forward to working with you and ( name of client company ) in the future and sincerely apolo-
gize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused you.

3.3 Cost of Permanent Hiring Letter

City, State, Zip

Dear Mr./Ms./Mrs.__________:

Recruiting, employee benefits, and payroll processing costs are skyrocketing. Are you hiring full-time
permanent employees needlessly? Do you consider hiring permanent staff the only solution to handling
your excess workflow?

Trojan Labor offers you an alternative to the increasing costs of permanent staffing. Utilizng temporary
employees can save your company money. By permanently selecting a temporary worker, you pay only
for actual time worked. You are not responsible for recruiting costs, payroll costs, or benefits. As the
temporary workers’ legal employer, we take care of those things for you.

If you still feel the need to find a permanent employee, and you find that one of our employees suits your
permanent staffing needs, we have a temp-to-perm program available. If not, Trojan Labor can help you
fill in the gap so you can take time to make the right hiring decision. With Trojan Labor, your workflow
won’t be disrupted and your schedules and deadlines are maintained.

I will call on you during the next few days so we can discuss a plan to help keep your hiring costs down.
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

3.9 The Lincoln Letter

June 20, 2006

(Individual Name)
(Individual Title)
(Company Name)
(Company Address)
(City, State, Zip.)

Dear Mr./Ms./Mrs. _________:

During the American Civil War, General George B. McClellan was commanding the Union Army and
conducting a “waiting campaign.” He was waiting because he was afraid to make a mistake, so he did
not do anything. Finally, President Lincoln was forced to write McClellan a letter:

		              “My Dear McClellan:
		              If you don’t want to use the army, I should like to borrow it for a while.
		              Yours respectfully,
		              A. Lincoln”

That’s what temporary staffing is all about. Not everyone has his own army, but the efficient manager
should know where to find one when it is needed.

That’s our job. Whether you are looking for one person, several people, or even a platoon, we can pro-
vide the temporary staff necessary to get the job done. At Trojan Labor, we don’t pretend to be all things
to all people. We cannot and will not attempt to find you a qualified secretary. We pride ourselves on
serving industries just like yours all over the country. Unlike the majority of our competition, we do not
treat blue-collar placement as a sideline to our main source of business. We are experts at what we do
and have been for many years.

One important thing to remember: when direct and indirect costs are tallied, the actual hourly cost for
our staff will probably be less than what you pay your own permanent staff – without the advertising.

Remember the Trojan Horse? Whether you need one person for one day or an army of people for sev-
eral months, call in the experts. Call Trojan Labor.


Sincerely,

3.10 Bid Proposal
64 |   sales manual




A LEADER SINCE 1991

Trojan Labor was founded in Miami in 1991 by Richard F. Hermanns. Over 9 years of experience have
given us the ability to provide your company with the highest level of service in the temporary labor
industry.

A NATIONAL COMPANY BUILT ON LOCAL SERVICE

Trojan Labor is a privately owned, nationwide network of branch offices located in principal cities
throughout the United States. We currently have 26 offices nationwide and are in the process of opening
many additional locations within the next three years. Our customers can depend on us to provide them
outstanding local service backed by standardized policies and procedures that are proven effective across
multiple offices.

Trojan Labor assumes all the responsibility for our temporary employee’s wages, payroll deductions,
contributions, unemployment and worker’s compensation, in the same manner as any other employer.

OUR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS

Our service delivery system is designed to consistently provide workers for general and semi-skilled la-
bor positions. The flexibility built into our system provides us the opportunity to service many different
industries on short notice – warehouse, construction, assembly, hospitality, and recycle/waste manage-
ment.

We open early so you don’t have to. All our branches open at 5:30 AM. We perform all daily orienta-
tion, screening, and assignment prior to the start of business of most of our customers so they get the
workers they need when they need them. This combined with our direct dispatch system allows us to
respond to customer requests on short notice. During peak times we respond routinely within one hour.

Trojan Labor Recruiting and Retention Programs

The majority of our workers are attracted to Trojan Labor because of our reputation as a leader in our
industry. Over 40% of our prospective employees are referred by present or former Trojan Labor em-
ployees, as well as by our customers. We also actively recruit applicants from proven reliable recruiting
sources such as military recruitment centers and churches.

Trojan Labor offices participate in numerous local recruiting programs. Our offices also set up short-
term recruiting centers to reach candidates in a given local area. These efforts generate a large number
of temporary employees that have the ability and willingness to do a good job for you.

Effective retention programs such as performance bonuses, employee recognition, and special events to
say thank you for a job well done are initiated for retention purposes.

Trojan Labor maintains competitive pay rates. Like any good employer, we will grant pay increases, at
your request, based on performance and length of service.
 	                                                                                        | 65




Our full-time staff establishes a rapport with our employees in order to understand their needs and their
qualifications. This, combined with our service system, is Trojan Labor’s most important retention
source. Our temporary employees are certain they will be given assignments that match their abilities.

Trojan Labor Ordering Process

Our ordering process is thorough. By finding out exactly what you need, when you need it, and for how
long, we can provide you with a temporary employee who will match your needs.

When you call Trojan Labor to place an order for a temporary employee, we will ask you a number of
questions concerning the type of work the employee will be doing and the type of equipment, if any, that
will be used. The more accurate the job description is, the better able we will be to fill your order. The
questions we ask are designed to ensure that we understand what your expectations are and that we com-
municate those expectations to the assigned worker.

Trojan Labor Assignment Process

Based on the information we receive during the order process, we identify and select the employee who
best matches your needs. We contact these employees to verify their availability, describe the assign-
ment, and ask for their commitment. Our assignment process assures you Trojan Labor employees who
will perform to your satisfaction. It also assures you will get a worker on your team that understands
your needs and the requirements of the job.

All Trojan Labor employees will report to your location well groomed and in uniform upon your request.
In short, the assignment process assures that Trojan Labor will provide you with men and women who
are properly groomed and willing to work. We expect our employees to adhere to all rules and conduct
themselves in the same manner you expect of your employees.

Trojan Labor Quality Control Process

Our quality control process assures you of our commitment to consistent, high quality service. During
the assignment we will contact you by telephone and in person on a regular basis to ensure that the work
is progressing well and to address any other needs or concerns that you might have.

We also ask that you evaluate our employee’s work. This review helps us troubleshoot, and evaluate the
quality of service we are providing. Your comments are very valuable and important to us. We always
appreciate our customer’s input.

Professional Full Time Staff

Trojan Labor’s full-time staff members are professionals who are trained to assist you with all of your
temporary labor needs. Training is an ongoing process at both the corporate and local levels. Our staff
is a highly competent work force dedicated to providing you with the highest level of service in the tem-
porary labor industry.

CUSTOMER PROTECTION

Unconditional Guarantee

We guarantee your total satisfaction. You must be completely satisfied with the work performed by
Trojan Labor’s temporary employees. If you notify your Trojan Labor office within 4 hours of a Trojan
Labor employee’s arrival that you are not satisfied with that employee’s performance, any corresponding
charges will be cancelled immediately.

Insurance

Our temporary employees are the direct employees of Trojan Labor. Unlike some of our competitors,
our employees ARE NOT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. Therefore, we assume all employer
responsibilities. A copy of our Certificate of Insurance is available upon request.

Invoice Handling

To help expedite your invoice processing, invoices may be mailed to any location, department, or person
you designate. We also have special systems available, such as invoices itemized by employee name or
by date, and separation of job sites. All invoicing is done on a weekly basis to ensure consistent review
and approval of our service system.

One Trojan Labor Contact

In order to ensure a better ongoing understanding of your needs, our branch managers serve as the pri-
mary contact for account coordination. Although other staff members in our office will be familiar with
your needs, you will have the convenience of dealing with one person who is responsible for the local
services we provide.

Payroll Transfer

On occasion, Trojan Labor temporary employees receive offers of full-time positions from our custom-
ers. Due to the expense and the amount of time we invest in recruiting, we generally require the tempo-
rary employee to remain on our payroll a minimum of 400 hours before transferring them to your pay-
roll. We also request that you contact us directly about hiring any temporary, prior to extending an offer
of full-time employment to them.

Additional Services

We can also provide additional services such as drug screening, background checks, skills testing, pre-
training of employees, or uniforms depending on your specific requirements.

Just let us know what you need. We will cater our services to meet your needs.
 	                                                                                             | 67
