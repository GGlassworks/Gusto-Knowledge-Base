FIRST GOLDEN RULE

 A CUSTOMER IN NEED
IS A CUSTOMER INDEED
     When there is not much
difference between your product
      and the product of your
competitor, there needs to be a
 BIG difference in the quality of
     service you provide your
            customer.
SECOND GOLDEN RULE

  HIRE PEOPLE WITH
  GOOD CUSTOMER
   SERVICE SKILLS
  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

T -- 20
                         Attitude
T -- 20
                          equals
I -- 9
                         100%.
T -- 20
U -- 21
D -- 4
          ATTITUDE IS A LITTLE THING
E -- 5    THAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE
       HOW TO HIRE GREAT
           EMPLOYEES:

 Seek out the great employees who already
  work for you. Interview them, find out what
   makes them tick. Write profiles of great
employees. Find out what qualities they have
in common. Then look to hire people with the
                same qualities.
THIRD GOLDEN RULE

    TRAIN YOUR
EMPLOYEES ON STORE
     POLICIES
BE THE EXAMPLE FOR
YOUR EMPLOYEES TO
EMULATE.

DON’T ASK YOUR
EMPLOYEES TO DO
SOMETHING YOU
WOULDN’T.
       EXAMPLE POLICIES
• Visit with customers
• No whispering
• Walk the customer to product
• Don’t get in the customer’s way when
  working in the aisles
• 10 ft rule – Greet the customer
• 2 is company but 3 is a crowd – more than
  two in line call for help
• 3 sacks = mandatory carry out
• Thank the Customer no matter what
FOURTH GOLDEN RULE

 CROSS TRAIN YOUR
    EMPLOYEES
  Provide opportunities for employees
to learn.
 The kind of employees you want are the
kind who want to learn. Good workers
improve their skills in many areas of work
and life. They can either do it on their own,
and be more inclined to go elsewhere for
continued challenge and learning, or they
can learn under your auspices, and
develop close ties to your organization
while they do.
• Communicate the task. Describe exactly what
  you want done, when you want it done, and
  what end results you expect.
• Furnish context for the task. Explain why the
  task needs to be done, its importance in the
  overall scheme of things, and possible
  complications that may arise during its
  performance
• Determine standards. Agree on the standards
  that you will use to measure the success of a
  task's completion. These standards should be
  realistic and attainable.
FIFTH GOLDEN RULE

    TRAIN YOUR
EMPLOYEES HOW TO
BUILD RAPPORT WITH
  THE CUSTOMER
  Teach your employees how to create
   excellent customer service through
           human interaction
• All customers are greeted politely and
  courteously.
• Create an atmosphere of friendliness
  throughout each customer interaction.
• Professionalism is displayed through word
  and deeds.
• Show empathy and understanding for a
  customer with a problem
• All customers are treated fairly in every
  interaction with the store
• Conduct yourself with tact
 SIXTH GOLDEN RULE

KNOW YOUR CUSTOMERS
 NAMES AND USE THEM
   Use the following to build positive
   relationships with your customers
• KIDS NAMES
• ACHIEVEMENTS
• HONOR ROLL
• MARRIAGE
• NEW CAR
• HAIR STYLE CHANGE

**STAY AWAY FROM PERSONAL
  SENSITIVE SUBJECTS
EVERYONE HAS AN INVISIBLE
SIGN HANGING FROM HIS OR
  HER NECK THAT READS
“MAKE ME FEEL
 IMPORTANT,”
NEVER FORGET THIS WHEN
 WORKING WITH PEOPLE.
SEVENTH GOLDEN RULE

     TRAIN YOUR
  EMPLOYEES HOW TO
   ASK OPEN ENDED
     QUESTIONS
 Open-ended questions are questions
  that encourage people to talk about
whatever is important to them. They help
       to establish rapport, gather
        information, and increase
understanding. They are the opposite of
              closed-ended
questions that typically require a simple
   brief response such “yes” or “no.”
       Examples of open-ended
             questions:
• How can I be of help?
• · Would you tell me more about ___?
• · Could you help me understand ___?
• · What are the good things and the less good
  things about ___?
• · What do you think you will lose if you give up
  ___?
• · What have you tried before?
• · What do you want to do next?
                           Affirmations
Affirmations are statements and gestures that recognize client
strengths and acknowledge behaviors that lead in the direction of
positive change, no matter how big or small. Affirmations build
confidence in one’s ability to change. To be effective,
affirmations must be genuine and congruent.

Examples of affirmation statements:
· Thank you for …
· I really like the way you …
· That was a very creative how you …
· You showed a lot of self-control in the way you …
· It may not seem like much, but I think it was very impressive
how you …
· You have a real gift for …
“TO GIVE REAL SERVICE YOU MUST
  ADD SOMETHING WHICH CANNOT BE
  BOUGHT OR MEASURED WITH
  MONEY, AND THAT IS SINCERITY AND
  INTEGRITY”
                -Donald A. Adams
EIGHTH GOLDEN RULE

  INSTILL A SENSE OF
 URGENCY IN HELPING
     CUSTOMERS
WHAT DO THESE CUSTOMERS
    HAVE IN COMMON?
     EDUCATE YOUR EMPLOYEES
      ON FIVE PRINCIPLES OF A
         GOOD EMPLOYEE
   • URGENCY
   • OWNERSHIP
   • LEARN-BY-DOING
   • LIFELONG LEARNING
   • MOTIVATION
Customers don’t expect you to be perfect. They do expect
you to fix things when they go wrong
NINTH GOLDEN RULE

   TRAIN YOUR
EMPLOYEES HOW TO
  HANDLE ANGRY
   CUSTOMERS
NEVER ARGUE WITH A
    CUSTOMER.
     LISTEN!

CLOSE YOUR MOUTH
   AND LISTEN!!

WHEN THAT DOESN’T
   WORK…….
  Saying I’m
  sorry will
 often times
reduce anger.
  Apologies
even if it was
not your fault.
 Defusing Angry Customers using
     the LARSON approach
• Listen let them vent. Empathize, take notes
• Agreement find areas of agreement
• Repeat/Restate use the customers words for
  clarification of issue
• Seek Resolution Ask what can be done to
  resolve the problem
• Offer a sincere apology We’re sorry this
  happened and if were responsible we will
  make it right
• Now solve the problem immediately
       THE FOUR R’S
• REPEAT
• REVIEW
• RESPOND
• RESOLVE
TENTH GOLDEN RULE

DON’T LET AN ANGRY
 CUSTOMER LEAVE
   YOUR STORE
         10 WAYS TO BUILD
        CUSTOMER LOYALTY
1. Take ownership of your customer’s problem.
   Even if you are not the cause of it.
2. Follow up with every customer who was upset
   or had a difficult problem.
3. Ask yourself with every customer interaction
   you have, “If this were me, what would I want?”
4. Thank your customers and co-workers every
   chance you get!
