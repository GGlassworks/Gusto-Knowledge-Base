Transaction Privilege Tax Changes and News
TPT 2025 ELECTRONIC ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX PAYMENT
Annual estimated tax payment of transaction privilege, telecommunications services excise, and county
excise taxes are required if:
  • Combined tax liability for transaction privilege, telecommunications services excise, and county excise
    taxes in the preceding calendar year was $4,100,000 or more.

Deadline
The statutory due date for the annual estimated tax payment is June 20.
  • When filed electronically via www.AZTaxes.gov, it must be received by the department no later than
    Monday, June 30.

How do I calculate my payment?
There are two methods available to calculate your June estimated payment:
  • One half of the actual tax liability from the month of May, or
  • The actual tax liability from June 1 through June 15.

Electronic payments
  • Taxpayers required to pay electronically may be subject to penalties for payments made by check or cash.
  • To file and pay online, a business must be registered on AZTaxes.gov and use ACH debit, e-check, or
    credit as a payment method to comply with electronic funds transfer (EFT) payment requirements.


ADOR AUTO-RENEWS 2025 STATE TPT LICENSES
Renewals were due on January 1, 2025. Businesses that did not renew will receive letters for overdue renewal
fees.

Taxpayers can no longer manually renew online, but they can still pay the license fee liability at AZTaxes.gov.
Prompt compliance online can save both time and money.

Taxpayers who have closed their business must cancel their existing Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT) license
through AZTaxes.gov or submit a Business Account Update form with a cancel effective date. This will ensure
your account remains in good standing and avoids additional penalties and interest.

Keep your mailing addresses and account information up-to-date to ensure letters, notices, and billings go
to the correct address. Please note, there is a unique address for all renewal forms, correspondence, and
payments:
Arizona Department of Revenue
Attn: License and Registration
PO Box 29082
Phoenix, AZ 85038-9082



 (602) 255-3381 or toll-free at (800) 352-4090                www.azdor.gov             APPLY | FILE | PAY
                                                                                                   June 2025 | Page 1
                                       TPT Newsletter
Renewal forms, correspondence, or payments sent to any other address will delay processing.

As a reminder, operating without proper licensing may be a class 3 misdemeanor.

Once a business has renewed their TPT license and paid the license in full, the information is validated and
the new TPT license certificate is generated to be sent to the mailing address on file with ADOR.


AMENDING A TPT RETURN
To amend a previously filed Form TPT-2, you must mark the “Amended Return” box. The amended return
will replace the previously filed return. Complete the return with the corrected numbers only. Include all lines
present on the original return, even if there are no changes to those lines.

An amended return that results in a refund or credit must be filed within four years of the original return due
date or four years from the date the original return was filed, whichever date is later. A taxpayer may not use
an amended return to change the application of a claimed estimated tax payment.

There may be times that you file your return but submit a payment at a later date. Make payments online for
quicker service. Please do not submit your return again with a paper payment. Instead, include your transaction
privilege tax license number, EIN, or SSN in the memo with the previous filing period to match the return.


GUEST CREDIT/DEBIT CARD PAYMENT OPTION
AZTaxes allows secure access for taxpayers to make individual income tax payments 24 hours a day/7 days
a week.

Businesses can make a transaction privilege tax (TPT)/use tax credit or debit card payment as a Guest
using the Quick Links menu on the AZTaxes homepage. Businesses need to know their license number and
business mailing zip code.

Businesses are not required to log in to their AZTaxes account to make a quick payment. Please note: Only
registered business users can make an e-check payment. Service charges may apply.


DEDUCTION REJECTION
TPT returns are commonly rejected or held due to deduction errors. Deductions listed in the Schedule A of the
TPT return must be complete and must match the Transaction Detail deductions to be allowed. Please ensure
calculations are correct and that all information has been included.

  • The city or region code listed on the Transaction Detail page matches the city/region codes on the Schedule
    A deduction details.
  • The deduction code claimed on the return is applicable to the business code reported. Deductions can
    only be claimed for an allowable business class activity.
  • The Schedule A deduction amounts equal the amount entered on the Transaction Details page.
  • The deduction code matches the deduction description on Schedule A.

If you receive a notice indicating information is missing or not matching on the return, please submit an amended
return with necessary corrections. Otherwise, please pay the balance indicated on the correspondence by
the due date to avoid additional penalties and interest.

         (602) 255-3381 or toll-free at (800) 352-4090                                          www.azdor.gov
                                                                                                    June 2025 | Page 2

return errors.

page.


TPT FILING FACTS
  • Sending returns without payment generates a bill. ADOR recommends sending returns with all applicable
    fees and payments to avoid receiving a bill.
  • An estimated TPT payment is due if the business’ anticipated tax liability is $4,100,000 or more in 2025.
  • There are two different types of AZTaxes users: Primary and Delegate. For assistance on primary and
    delegate access see the AZTaxes User Access web page.
  • If your business is adding a location to an existing license, file a Business Account Update form.
