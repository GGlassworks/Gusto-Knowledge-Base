                                TRAINING MODULE: CUSTOMER SERVICE

Customer service is the act of taking care of the customer’s needs by providing professional, helpful quality
service and assistance before, during, and after the customer’s expectations are met. A customer can be
both internal and external to the organization. This can include patients/residents, visitors, team members,
medical staff, volunteers, and more. Customer service is something most people don’t consider or
appreciate until there is a problem. Customer service experiences can change the entire perception a
customer has on an individual or even the entire organization that an employee represents. It can be an
important factor in making your organization the healthcare facility of choice for the people in your service
area. Good customer service will improve customer satisfaction and cooperation, and improve outcomes.

MEETING CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS

Customers expect certain things when they walk into a healthcare facility, and the facilities with the highest
level of customer satisfaction know how to identify these expectations and meet them. Some of the most
common expectations that customers have for healthcare facilities are similar to other businesses. These
include fast, efficient and accurate service, friendly and helpful staff, prompt responses to questions,
trained team members that can handle their immediate questions without being transferred or placed on
hold, and attentiveness to a customer’s problems or complaints. The best way to determine how well you
met your customers’ expectations is to simply ask the question. Your organization may also provide a
formal customer satisfaction survey. The goal of both is to discover ways to improve your customers’
experiences. Remember, customers are savvy enough to take their business elsewhere if they are not
receiving the service and attention they seek.

MEETING AND GREETING

       Your customer will make early decisions about you and perhaps the organization based upon your
        appearance, attitude, body language, facial expressions, what you say and especially tone of voice.
       Making a strong, positive first impression will help you develop a good customer relationship.
       Be sure to make eye contact, display a nice warm smile, provide a friendly greeting, give the
        customer your undivided attention and listen to their needs and questions with empathy and
        compassion.
       The words you use will set the hospital apart as well. Using words such as “May I” instead of “Can
        I”, and “Yes” instead of “Yup” as well as avoiding absolute extremes such as “every”, “all”, “never”
        and “always” will help.

POSITIVE ATTITUDE

Good customer service begins with a positive attitude. It is not just what a person says; it is how they say it
and how they behave while they are saying it. Your tone of voice and behavior speaks loudly to those we
serve. It reinforces your competence and commitment to providing excellent, quality care towards the task
at hand.

       To display a positive attitude pause, take a deep breath and think before you speak.
       Self-talk can also have a dramatic affect both positively and negatively. You have a choice about
        what you say to yourself.
       Positive words include “I can do it”.
       Negative words limit our potential and are self-defeating. Choose to be positive.
       Be flexible and adapt to new challenges.
       Providing customer service is not easy but with making good choices about one’s thoughts,
        anything is possible. Sharing negative thoughts about your job, the organization, or other team
        members with the customer leads to doubt, anxiety and a negative experience for the people we
        serve. Avoid sharing these thoughts as many times we invite the type of behavior that we show to
        others.

ACTIVE LISTENING

Hearing is not the same as listening. Active listening displays a concerned attitude, enhanced understanding
and better customer satisfaction. It allows for greater productivity with fewer mistakes. Information that
the customer provides is vital. You may even want to take notes. Active listening takes focus, energy, and
attention. To do this you must recognize and remove physical barriers (such as turning off screens that
could distract you), minimize internal barriers (such as allowing your mind to drift or make assumptions),
use nonverbal encouragers (such as eye contact and head nods), and verbal encouragers (such as hmm, oh,
ah…) to show that you are paying attention, ask open-ended questions, listen with purpose, and recap your
understanding of the issue. Everyone can overcome these obstacles. Remember, listening is not passive, it
is active. Stay alert and be energetic about listening, if not you may miss important information.

HANDLING CUSTOMER SERVICE STRESS

Many people allow events to shape how they feel and what they do. However, events can only control your
attitude if you allow it. When providing customer service, it is important to not allow stressful events to
govern your attitude. If you are unprepared and unfocused when providing customer service, you may be
caught off guard and perceive the event as a threat. Your natural reaction will be to respond to the threat
either by fighting or running (also known as the fight or flight stress response). Most of the customer
service events that you experience at work are not life threatening and therefore you must change your
perception of the encounter.
      Good customer service does not include fighting with the customer or running away by making
        excuses or prematurely ending a conversation.
      Your primary role in a stressful customer service encounter is to keep the situation under control
        and prevent things from getting worse.
      Always take into consideration the customer’s frame of mind at the time of the event.
      Disarm a difficult customer with a greeting and an invitation to help.
      Smile even if the event takes place over the phone.
      Respond by conveying the truth and invite the customer in a two-way discussion with words like “I
        understand, I see, or I hear what you are saying, etc.”.
      You are not in control of every event but you are in control of your own behavior and response to
        these events.
      There is no place for anger in customer service. Choose to stay calm.
      Be prepared. Pause, take a deep breath, slow down your pace of speech, allow the customer to
        vent, take notes, listen actively, be emphatic, think rationally and focus on what you can control.
        Remember, the real problem is whatever is causing the customer to behave that way, not the
        customer’s behavior.
      The root cause of the behavior must be fixed in order to meet the customers’ expectations.
INTERNAL CUSTOMER SERVICE

We often think of the importance of customer service in regards to individuals who visit our organization
such as patients/residents and visitors. However, those you serve internally should be provided the same
consideration. While all of the principles previously discussed can be applied, there are additional concerns
when servicing those who work for the organization.

WORKPLACE CONFLICT

Workplace conflict is a normal and natural part of any workplace and can occur when there is a
disagreement or opposition of interests or ideas. It has been estimated that managers spend at least 25
percent of their time resolving workplace conflicts. By learning to constructively resolve conflict, we can
turn a destructive situation into an opportunity for creativity and enhanced work performance.

There are many causes of conflict in a work setting including ineffective communication, differences in
values and interests, scarce resources, personality clashes, and poor performance. Sometimes what we are
trying to communicate gets lost in translation despite our best intentions. These conflicts can be resolved
through active listening, asking the appropriate questions, and making sure both parties are understood.
      The failure to accept or understand one another’s differing values can lead to conflict.
      The way a person views or addresses a situation is not wrong just because it does not match your
         own. You may have differing interests as well.
      Sometimes an individual’s personal goals can be at odds with your goals or even the organization’s
         goals.
      This conflict can be addressed by finding a common ground and negotiating goals that work for
         everyone.
      Scarce resources can make employees feel they have to compete for available resources in order
         to do their job.
      This can be alleviated by teaching prioritization of time and resources, as well as ways to negotiate
         with one another.
      Personality clashes can cause conflict. All organizations are made up of different personalities and
         team members must strive to understand and accept each other’s approach to work and problem-
         solving.
      Conflict can also occur when team members are not contributing their share of effort or not
         performing at the expected level of quality.
      This can cause extra work and frustration for others. This issue can be resolved by their manager
         through coaching, feedback and evaluation.
      Arriving at a positive resolution to conflict is always the ultimate goal.
      In resolving conflict, it is important that you clearly state the cause of the conflict and why and how
         you recommend it being resolved. It is best to address conflict face-to-face and stick to the issue at
         hand.
      Sometimes our emotions may interfere with arriving at a resolution. If this happens, take a time-
         out and continue resolving the conflict at another designated time.
      Avoiding conflict is often the easiest way to deal with it; however, it does not make it go away.
      By actively resolving conflict when it occurs, you can create a more positive work environment for
         everyone.
WORKPLACE BULLYING

Workplace bullying refers to any repeated, intentional behavior directed at an employee with the purpose
of degrading, humiliating, embarrassing, or otherwise undermining their performance. Bullying can come
from team members, supervisors, or management, and is a problem for workers at all levels. By learning to
recognize and address workplace bullying behavior, you can help to create a healthier, more productive
environment for yourself and your co-workers.

      Bullying is more than a simple misunderstanding or personal disagreement.
      Workplace bullying may include shouting, whether in private, in front of team members, or in front
       of customers, name calling, belittling or disrespectful comments, excessive monitoring, criticizing,
       or nitpicking someone’s work, deliberately overloading someone with work, undermining
       someone’s work by setting them up to fail, and excluding someone from staff room conversations
       and making them feel unwelcome.
      If you feel singled out unfairly, or feel you are being picked on, form a plan to stop the bullying.
      Never escalate the bullying.
      Shouting counter insults or yelling back might end up making the situation worse.
      Use a calm and collected tone of voice and tell the person to stop.
      Keep a record of the bullying including specific times, dates and locations.
      Ask co-workers if they will serve as witnesses to bullying incidents.
      Set up a meeting with your supervisor or human resources representative.
      Bring your written evidence, your witnesses, and present your case in a calm manner.
      If the bullying continues, you have the right to go to higher management.
