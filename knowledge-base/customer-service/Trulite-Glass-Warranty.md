This Limited Warranty shall continue for a period of ten (10) years (the “Limited Warranty Period”) from the date of shipment. This
Limited Warranty shall be conditioned upon and subject to the installer, general contractor, architect of record or owner’s (each a
“Customer”) determination that the Products are suitable for and compatible with the Customer’s intended use, and such determination
shall be the sole responsibility of the Customer.

this Limited Warranty signifies that the Customer has voluntarily and knowingly consented to all terms, including the waivers and
limitations contained within this Limited Warranty.

THE CUSTOMER’S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY:

If a Product is proven defective within the Limited Warranty Period, then as the Customer’s sole remedy, Trulite either will: (A) replace
the defective Product without charge, FOB to the Trulite location nearest to the place of installation or; (B) at Trulite’s option, refund the
purchase price of the defective Product. Trulite will not be liable for any other expenses involved in the removal of such Product,
installation of a replacement Product, or any other incidental or consequential damages, including, without limitation, attorney’s fees,
transportation costs or labor. The warranty for any replacement Product shall be limited to the terms and conditions of this Limited
Warranty and shall continue for a period of time equal to the remainder of the Limited Warranty Period provided in this Limited
Warranty.

THE CUSTOMER’S WARRANTY IS NON-TRANSFERRABLE:

For multiple business reasons, including the duty to care and maintain the Product appropriately, this Limited Warranty (unless Trulite
agrees, in a written agreement signed by Trulite, with the Customer to amend this provision): (i) is limited to the Customer to whom the
Product was sold and is nontransferable, nonassignable and cannot be extended by operation of law or otherwise beyond the
Customer; (ii) replaces all previous warranties; and (iii) applies only to purchases and installations within the United States on or after
September 1, 2016.

FILING A CLAIM:

To file a claim under this Limited Warranty, the Customer must contact us, in writing, within fifteen (15) calendar days of the discovery
of an alleged manufacturing defect in a Product, at Trulite Glass & Aluminum Solutions LLC, Attn: Technical Services Department, 403
Westpark Ct. Suite 201, Peachtree City, GA 30269, although Trulite may change this address by written notice to the Customer as
provided on Trulite’s website. Proof of purchase from the Customer must be submitted with any notice of claim. We have the right to
physically inspect an installation site and obtain samples from that job installation and of the Products used in that installation before we
determine the validity of the Customer’s claim. The Customer’s claim must be received and evaluated by us before any repair or
replacement work is performed; otherwise, this Limited Warranty will be null and void. For additional information regarding our warranty
policy, please refer to our website at www.trulite.com.

THIS WARRANTY IS GOVERNED BY GEORGIA LAW:

In providing this Limited Warranty, Trulite and the Customer agree that Georgia law governs this Limited Warranty, including Title 11,
Official Code of Georgia Annotated, § 11-2-101, et seq. This Limited Warranty shall be governed by and interpreted according to
Georgia law, without giving effect to conflict of law principles. Except as provided above, any action or claim arising out of or relating to
this Limited Warranty may be brought, if at all, in a federal or state court in Atlanta (Fulton County), Georgia having subject matter
jurisdiction over the matter, and the Customer irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of that court and waives any objection that the
court in Atlanta is an inconvenient forum. At Trulite’s sole election, any dispute arising out of or related to this Limited Warranty shall be
submitted to binding arbitration in Atlanta, Georgia in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any award
ordered in such arbitration shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.
