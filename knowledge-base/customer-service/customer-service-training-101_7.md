W
               ith so much competition in today’s global economy, providing
               exceptional customer service is no longer an added benefit; it is a
               necessity. Customers who are not satisfied with the way they are
treated can easily take their business elsewhere.
    Whether your business is a multimillion dollar enterprise or a one-person
operation, customers pay attention to how they are treated. They are buying
more than your product. Consumers will often pay more, drive farther, and in-
convenience themselves to do business with a company that appreciates them.
Providing exceptional service will build the bond that keeps customers coming
back time and time again. Customers may first come into your business because
of your product, but they will decide to come again based on how well they are
treated. If they are not treated properly, they will go elsewhere.
    Providing exceptional customer service is accomplished by positively inter-
acting with customers through effective communication and relationship build-
ing. Learning how to treat your customers exceptionally well will bring about an
unexpected result: your customers will become a marketing tool for your busi-
ness. People talk. Whether you provide great customer service or poor customer
service, the people with whom you do business are going to tell others how they
are treated. When people hear good things about your business, they are more
likely to do business with you as well.
    Your customers will benefit from this training. They will come away from
their transaction with your business feeling they have been treated exceptionally
well. They will feel they have been treated fairly and professionally. Most impor-
tantly, they will feel that you and your employees appreciate them.
    Your employees will benefit from this training. They will take more respon-
sibility for their customers and for their work. They will care more about their
jobs and about their company. They will gain more job satisfaction and feel good
about coming to work. Absenteeism and turnover may even be reduced.
    You will benefit from this training. After you and your employees complete
this training, you will become more focused. Your employees will know how to

                                                                                     1

               However, customer service training will only go so far. Your employees must
           also know how to handle your customers’ requests. Before beginning this train-
           ing, make sure your employees understand their job duties. Make sure they know
           how far they can go when trying to satisfy customers. Specific methods and pro-
           cedures that apply to your business should be taught and clearly understood be-
           fore beginning these lessons. Doing so will make it easier and also more logical
           for your employees to incorporate these customer service techniques into their
           daily routine. Doing so will enable your employees to provide an exceptional
           experience for each customer.
               Why is this book important? The answer is simple: Providing great customer
           service costs much less, in dollars and sense, than providing poor service. It costs
           more to gain new customers than it does to maintain existing ones. Customers
           will be more loyal to your business when you treat them well. Simply put, a sat-
           isfied customer is more likely to maintain an ongoing business relationship than
           a dissatisfied customer.
               Finally, the most important benefit of customer service training is increased
           productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness. It is cheaper and faster to do the job
           right the first time. Satisfying an unhappy customer costs a lot more, both in
           dollars and cents, than satisfying a customer on the first try.

T
        raining, even if you have never done it before, can be a fun and positive
        experience for both you and your employees. The key to holding a suc-
        cessful training session lies in preparation. Preparing before you begin
will help you feel comfortable and confident and will take the guesswork out of
what to expect. Preparation includes identifying your training needs, defining
learning outcomes, planning your teaching method, establishing time frames for
training sessions, preparing yourself for the training, setting up the room, and
following up after the training.



Identify Your Training Needs
To identify your training needs, answer this question: Why did you decide to
conduct customer service training? Your immediate response might be “because
we need it,” but to answer this question reflectively you must first analyze and
identify what needs to be improved from both your business and your employees’
perspectives.
    Think about your business. Make a list of your customer service training needs
as they specifically relate to the type of work you do and what your customers

                                                                                     3

 SERVICE   expect from you. If you have trouble identifying them, read through each chapter
TRAINING
           of the book; as you read, relate the material to your customer situations. For ex-
   101
           ample, when reading the chapter on telephone contacts, you may have the “ah-ha”
           moment when you realize that your employees answer the phone in a non-
           professional manner.
               Next, focus on your employees’ needs. Make a customer service learning out-
           come list for each employee and note strengths, areas of improvement, additional
           technical or job skills training needed, and any behavioral issues (such as a poor
           attitude toward customers) that need to be addressed.
               After completing the lists, you will be able to . . .



           Define Learning Outcomes
           Review the needs you identified and develop a list of realistic learning outcomes.
           What skills should all of your employees demonstrate at the end of the training
           session? You might want to identify learning outcomes by making a list of each
           chapter title and writing down the skills in which your employees should be
           proficient after they complete the training sessions.
               Using the example of employees answering calls in a nonprofessional man-
           ner, one learning outcome for that chapter could be: Answer the telephone as ABC
           Company, then (employee’s first name). Listing specific outcomes before you be-
           gin training will enable you to measure how well your employees are using their
           new skills.
               If you identified behavioral issues, you may want to make a separate list for
           those employees. This will help you focus on those items throughout the train-
           ing sessions and follow up afterward.
               Now that you have identified your learning outcomes, you will be able to . . .



           Plan Your Teaching Method
           Instructing a group of employees is beneficial both for you and your employees
           because you can have immediate discussions to clear up problem areas. Training
           employees self-paced can be beneficial because your employees can work through
           the material at their own pace, uninterrupted. If you choose self-paced training
                                                                                      5
                                                                                   TIPS FOR
sessions, follow up with group discussion meetings to make sure everyone has         THE
                                                                                   TRAINER
the same understanding of the learning outcomes.

Some suggestions for instructor-led training are:

➔ Vary your delivery by reading out loud to the students, having them take
  turns reading out loud and also reading to themselves.

➔ After reading the material, follow up with group discussions related to your
  business.

➔ Hold group brainstorming sessions to solve problems. Ask a question, and
  note all ideas and suggestions on a flip chart. Discuss which ones will work
  for your business.

➔ For some chapters, divide the group into pairs. Assign a customer service
  related problem that needs to be solved to each pair. Specify a time period to
  come up with a solution. Each pair will then present the problem and their
  solution to the group.

➔ Divide the group into role-play pairs. Give each pair a customer service sce-
  nario and some additional details to help them get into their roles. For ex-
  ample, for one pair, the customer is upset with your company, and the
  employee has a condescending attitude; for another, the employee does not
  listen well. Have one student play the role of the customer and another play
  the customer service employee. First have them role-play the contact doing
  it incorrectly, and then again using the correct skills they are learning.

➔ To energize the class, play a game related to the material. For example, after
  completing a session, have the group close their books and call out the key
  points for the chapter they just completed.

Some suggestions for self-paced training sessions are:

➔ Before beginning, briefly review the book with your employees. Explain how
  you want them to work through the material.

➔ If they are to work through the entire book, tell them to check with you
  periodically (after each part or chapter, for instance).
   6

   101     ➔ Explain how you are going to handle the brainstorm topics.
           ➔ Tell them to write down any items they want to discuss in a group meeting.
           ➔ Check on the employees periodically.
           ➔ Plan on meeting with the employees—either group or individually—on
             completion to review the material and practice lessons.

           Before you begin, write an introduction to kick off the training. Make your
           introduction short and stick to the basics. When you meet with your employees
           explain why you are conducting this training and discuss the learning outcomes.
           Keep in mind that you will have everyone’s undivided attention—during the first
           few minutes of speaking! Use this to your advantage and develop a strong intro-
           duction. Whether you tell a story, ask a question, or begin with a warm-up exer-
           cise or game, make sure these first few minutes grab your employees’ attention.
           Also discuss house-keeping items such as breaks and whether they can have food
           or a beverage in class.
               After planning the training and writing your introduction, you are ready to . . .



           Establish Time Frames for Training Sessions
           Now that you have reviewed the training material and planned your teaching
           method, you can establish time frames. What will be the most cost effective and
           efficient means to conduct the training?
                Think about your hours of operation, busy periods, and employee coverage.
           You already know whether you are going to lead the training class, schedule your
           employees to work through the training in a self-paced manner, or combine the
           two methods. Decide whether to work through the entire book in one session or
           to cover the material in multiple sessions.
                Read through the book again, noting the amount of time it takes you to com-
           pletely work through each chapter. When scheduling your employees, add a little
           extra time to your estimate to make sure your employees will not feel rushed.
                Write a schedule to which you can conform.You will lose credibility with your
           employees if you schedule a class and then cancel. Give this training priority. If
           it is important to you, it will be important to your employees.

Prepare Yourself for the Training
When you train, establish an open and relaxed atmosphere that encourages dis-
cussion by maintaining a positive attitude, keeping focused, remaining neutral,
staying relaxed, encouraging everyone to participate, and focusing on the end
goals.
    Rehearse and practice your presentations—both the general introduction
and how you plan to handle each chapter. It is perfectly normal to feel nervous,
particularly if training is not part of your routine responsibilities. Being well pre-
pared will help manage your nerves. Practice may not make perfect, but it will
help you gain confidence and feel more assured. Here are some tips for training
others:

➔ Focus on your students rather than on yourself.
➔ Keep in mind the importance of the material.
➔ Stay on track by making good notes—and using them.
➔ Try to stick to the allotted time, but be sure you plan enough time to be
  thorough. Do not rush against a time clock. It is better to adjust the time than
  the material.
➔ When you speak, make eye contact with your students, switching your gaze
  from one person to another in a pace that is comfortable, not staged.
➔ Vary your voice tone and inflection.
➔ Be yourself. Act naturally.
➔ If you become nervous, take slow, deep breaths to calm yourself.

You are almost ready to begin the training. The last thing to do is . . .



Set Up the Room
Plan a setting conducive to training. First, find a suitable room or area that is free
from distractions and noise.
   8
CUSTOMER
 SERVICE       If you are training a group, a U-shaped, rectangle, or round table works well.
TRAINING
           This way all the students can face each other for discussions, and you will be able
   101
           to move easily within and around the group. If you will be using an easel or chalk-
           board, make sure that all students can see it.
               If you are conducting individual training, find a quiet place where the student
           can work at a desk or table. If the training is self-paced, check on the employee
           frequently to answer questions.
               Whether you train a group or your employees work on their own, think of
           ways to energize them. Look for signs of tiredness or boredom—yawning, fidg-
           eting, or a glazed-over look. Here are some tips for energizing your group:

           ➔ Schedule short breaks every hour or two.

           ➔ Take stretch breaks.

           ➔ If you provide food for class, choose high-energy foods like nuts, raisins, and
             fruit juices.

           ➔ Pass out a piece of candy for a quick afternoon pick-me-up.

           ➔ Vary the class activities.

           ➔ Hold frequent discussions to break things up.

           Now, let the training begin. Make this a positive and fun experience. When you
           have completed the training sessions, your job is not quite through. To guarantee
           training success, it is imperative that you . . .



           Follow Up After the Training
           Spend time with your employees to observe their customer contacts. Try to catch
           them “doing it right”. When they do, acknowledge good performance by giving
           feedback that is specific to the behavior you observed. Rather than saying, “you
           did a great job,” be more specific by saying, “I really liked the way you handled
           Mrs. Johnson when she was upset. The way you explained our delivery schedule was
           right on target and you made sure she understood completely. Great job.” Now your
           employee knows exactly what was done right, and the behavior is more apt to be
           repeated.

ees, but it is never acceptable to discuss poor performance in public. When you
hear an employee handling a customer poorly, take that employee aside to dis-
cuss the incident.
    Recognize your group’s efforts by commending them, by awarding total team
efforts, and by reading customer commendations at meetings.
    Most importantly, be consistent with your team. Recognizing good behavior
yesterday but ignoring it today will confuse your employees. Make sure customer
service is important to you every day; then it will be important to your employees
every day, as well.

      Kris begins a new job working in a gift shop. She enjoys stocking
      shelves and arranging merchandise in the display cases and window.
      She gets along well with the other employees. At work, she and her
      coworkers joke around and have a good time. They have an inside
      joke about their customers: it would be nice if customers did not
      bother them. When a customer comes in, they busy themselves with
      their “real work,” ignoring the customer until they are asked for help,
      then making jokes about who got stuck handling the customer.

                 and have more time to joke around.
                      One day their manager has a meeting. She tells the employees that
                 she cannot understand why their sales have been declining, but with-

                      Kris is upset. She liked working in the gift shop because it was so
                 much fun. Kris is upset for the wrong reason. She does not under-
                 stand the most important rule of working in the customer service
                 field: it is the customers, not the company, who pay the wages.

                          CUSTOMERS = REVENUE = WAGES = EMPLOYEES


               Customer service training is important because customers have many choices.
           If they are not happy with the way they are treated, they can take their business
           elsewhere, just like the customers in the scenario above.

                          CUSTOMERS ARE THE REASON YOU HAVE A JOB.


               If Kris and her coworkers had learned this simple principle, they would have
           treated their customers differently.

       ter what the employees are doing. Because the manager explained
       the importance of customers, Kris and her coworkers understand
       that their customers are the reason they have jobs.
           The manager holds weekly group meetings. She keeps the group
       up to date on sales revenue data, consistently discusses the impor-
       tance of customers, and rewards exceptional behavior.
           Kris enjoys working in the relaxed atmosphere, where everyone
       works to achieve the clearly stated company goals. Kris finds tremen-
       dous job satisfaction working in the gift shop.

    Finally, customer service training is important because your customers are
important. Without customers, customer service employees are not needed.
    As you work through this training, you will learn how to handle different types
of customers in different situations. Taking the time to prepare for your training
sessions will help you make the most of the material. Preparation includes iden-
tifying your personal needs and defining learning outcomes, getting ready for
training sessions, working through the book, and following up after training.


Identify Your Personal Needs and Define Learning Outcomes
Think about your typical customer contacts. Which types of customers or cus-
tomer interactions are you uncomfortable handling? For example, are you unsure
how to talk to customers who are upset and confront you in an angry tone? Make
a list of any areas in which you need improvement or guidance.
     Now, think about your job from a technical standpoint. What must you learn
to do your job effectively? Make a list of those areas in which you need additional
training. Before you begin your customer service training, give this list to your
manager and ask for technical training first. You need to feel comfortable with
your job duties before you can feel comfortable helping your customers.
     Finally, think about what you want to gain from training. Make a list of learn-
ing outcomes. Turn your areas of improvement into learning outcomes by re-
  14
CUSTOMER
 SERVICE   phrasing them as positive statements. For example, not knowing how to deal with
TRAINING
           customers who are angry could be written as a learning objective: turn irate
   101
           customers into satisfied ones.


           Get Ready for the Training Session
           Being in a training class means being in a different routine. When you are used
           to interacting with customers, staying alert when you sit, read, and work through
           a book can be difficult. Make the most of the training sessions by:
           ➔ Getting enough sleep the night before training
           ➔ Eating a healthy breakfast
           ➔ Knowing what to expect during the class
           ➔ Taking deep breaths when you feel drowsy
           ➔ Standing and stretching when you feel sleepy
           ➔ Taking a short walking break when you feel ready to nod off


           Work Through the Book
           As you work through each chapter, relate what you are reading to the type of cus-
           tomer interactions you have.You and your manager may decide to focus on a spe-
           cific customer scenario for each chapter. If you do, use the blank pages found in
           Part II to write down a typical customer request. You can refer to this scenario
           when answering the practice lesson questions and refer to your answers in group
           discussions.
               Each chapter follows a similar format:
           ➔ General chapter information
           ➔ Scenario handled in a less than satisfactory manner




           ➔ Overview of the key points that will be covered in the chapter
           ➔ Each key point is explained step-by-step in an in-depth manner, with a re-
             take of a portion of the scenario

➔ Scenario handled correctly




➔ Summary of key points and steps

➔ Interactive training lesson

➔ Quick quotations for memory joggers

In addition, each chapter contains handy tips and topics for group meeting
brainstorming sessions.




   Read through a chapter. Review the key points and steps. If you feel comfort-
able with the material, work the practice lesson. If not, reread the chapter. Make
sure you understand the material before moving on to the next chapter.Write down
any questions you want to ask your manager or bring up in a group meeting.



Follow Up After Training
Review the learning outcomes you listed before you began. Did you learn how
to handle each one? If not, review the relevant chapters again. If, after reading
through the material a second time, you still feel uncomfortable or unsure, let
your manager know. Your manager can work with you to turn this area of im-
provement into a strength.
   Review your list of questions with your manager. Discuss answers and
solutions.
   Finally, enjoy your job. Your customers depend on you to be your best.

Taking Baby Steps:The Basics
               ALWAYS REMEMBER,THE CUSTOMER
                 IS THE REASON YOU HAVE A JOB.




W
               hat is happening to customer service? More
               often than not customers are met with bore-
               dom, indifference, and even rudeness or con-
descension. When they are greeted with a friendly smile
and a helpful attitude, they are thrilled. They may even tell
their friends. They feel grateful when they get good service. Customers should
never have to feel grateful for being treated well. Being treated well should be the
standard.
   Take off your customer service provider hat for a moment and put on your
            customer hat. Think about your own interactions as a customer. In
              the past few days, how many times were you a customer? Did you go
                     to the grocery store or run into a convenience store? Go to the
                     mall? How about visits to the post office, doctor’s office, bank,
dry cleaners, or your child’s school? How many times did you eat a meal out? Did
you call a company to place an order or ask a question or did you visit a Web site
and order products online?
   As a customer, you have many choices. How many restaurants are nearby?
How many stores are in your mall? How many doctors are in your phone book?


                                                                                         21

CUSTOMER
 SERVICE   If you are not happy with the service at one business, you have options. You can
TRAINING
           go somewhere else.
   101
               As a customer service employee, remember that your customers also have
           choices. If they are not happy with the way you treat them, they can go some-
           where else.
               How you treat your customers does matter. Think again, about your own
           interactions as a customer. Which ones stand out in your mind? You are likely
           to remember service that is outstanding or awful. Mediocre service is soon
           forgotten.



                        What Kind of Service Do You Give Your Customers?
           Ready to begin? We are going to start with the basics because:

                         THE BASICS ARE THE BASIS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.


           You begin providing customer service the moment a customer comes into your
           business, calls you on the telephone, or E-mails you. When customers physically
           walk through your door, they take a mental snapshot of you and your surround-
           ings. Without even thinking, they form a first impression. First impressions are
                               also formed over the telephone and through online contact.
                               How you speak, how well you listen, the words you choose, and
                               how you write and respond using E-mail contribute to first
                               impressions. If a customer’s first impression is favorable, you
                               have laid the foundation for providing great customer service.
           If the first impression is not favorable, you will have to dig deeper to build your
           foundation.
               Being courteous promotes a positive first impression. Customers appreciate
           courteous treatment. As young children, we learned basic courtesies: to say please
           and thank you; to pay attention and not to interrupt when other people speak;
           to treat others with respect; to play fairly; to say I’m sorry. As
           adults, we sometimes forget how important these words and
           actions are. Courtesy words, phrases, and behaviors contain
           powerful messages. They show you care.
               Your attitude can also foster a positive first impression.
           Customers appreciate a positive attitude. A great attitude
                                                                                          23
                                                                                        TAKING
can help overcome a poor first impression. Similarly, a negative attitude can de-        BABY
                                                                                         STEPS:
stroy a favorable first impression.
                                                                                       THE BASICS
    By combining a favorable first impression, courteous treatment, and a posi-
tive attitude, you form the basis for a strong customer service foundation. Add
effective communication skills, and you will be on your way to building long
lasting relationships with your customers. Once you master these customer serv-
ice basics, learn how to effectively communicate, and develop skills to build strong
relationships, you will confidently handle any customer in any situation.



                                                  PICTURE
                                                  THIS

       Sally drives to Bob’s Electronic Store to look for a new television set.
       She walks in and spots two employees stocking CDs on a display rack.
       They are laughing and joking with each other as they work. Neither
       looks at her. Neither asks if she needs help. She asks if they carry
       television sets.Without looking up, one of the employees says, “yeah,
       they’re over there,” pointing as he answers. She wanders over to the
       television sets. With so many new types from which to choose, she
       does not know what she wants. Neither of the employees asks if she
       needs help. She makes a mental note of the prices, leaves that store
       and drives to JB Appliances. A friendly young man greets her at the
       door. He looks directly at her, smiles, and says hello. She explains that
       she is looking for a new television, but does not know specifically
       what she wants. He assures her he can help, walks her to that area
       of the store, describes the different type sets, and takes the time to
       answer all her questions. She leaves the store with a new television.
       Even though the sets are priced higher at JB Appliances, Sally does
       not care. She likes the courteous way she is treated, so they get her
       business.

What Went Wrong?

Sally did not form a favorable first impression of the employees at Bob’s Elec-
tronic Store. Neither stopped what they were doing to help her. Neither were cour-
teous. They could have changed her first impression, but they did not project the
  24

TRAINING
           was treated, so she left and did business with another store.

           When you work with customers continuously, it is easy to begin taking them for
           granted. Remember what happened when Kris and her coworkers took their cus-
           tomers for granted? It is crucial that you not take your customers for granted.
           When you do, you stop caring about how you treat them. Eventually, you may
           view customers as though they are intruders who take you away from your work.
           This is the view Bob’s employees and Kris and her coworkers projected. When
           you do not treat your customers well, you may soon have no customers.
               Customers, on the other hand, have been conditioned to expect mediocre
           service. Customers who are given mediocre service will have mediocre attitudes
           about the business. When customers are valued and treated with courtesy and
           respect, they are more apt to do repeat business with you. Remember the im-
           portant lesson you learned as a child: Always treat others the way you want to be
           treated. Treat others well, and they will treat you well.
                                                                                        25

                STEP 4: Doing the Right Thing: Ethical Issues


If Bob’s employees treated Sally better, she would have had no reason to drive to
JB Appliances. She left because they did not value her as a customer. They did not
lay a foundation for giving great customer service.

In answer to the questions above, you may have answered something like this:

   How do you think Sally felt as a result of her treatment at Bob’s Electronic
   Store?
      Invisible.
      Her business did not matter to them.

   How do you think Sally felt as a result of her treatment at JB Appliances?
     They cared about her as a customer.
     They made her feel valued.
  26
CUSTOMER
 SERVICE
TRAINING              STEP 1:     First Impressions Matter
   101

                irst impressions are mental snapshots you take when you first encounter a
           F    person or situation. First impressions include a person’s looks and actions,
           including general grooming and cleanliness, clothing, voice tone, attitude, body
           language, and posture. These elements, put together, make up your personal
           style. First impressions do matter. They matter a lot. When people see you for the
           first time, what is their first impression of you?
               When Sally took her mental snapshot at Bob’s, it did not develop well. Even
           if the employees were well dressed, with neat hair, and clean clothes, their lack of
           courtesy and poor attitudes spoke volumes. When they ignored Sally, they told
           her loudly and clearly that they did not value her as a customer.
               People see you first, hear you second. The first step to making a good first
           impression is your appearance. When you do not have a nice appearance, you
           might present an obstacle that blocks your customers from forming a positive
           first impression. This does not mean you have to sacrifice your personal style to
           please others, but when you are at work make sure your appearance is fitting for
           your business. Otherwise you may have to work harder for your customers to get
           to know the real you.
               Wear appropriate clothing for the type of work you do. Wear the type of
           clothing that fits the personality of your business. If you work in an expensive
           restaurant, you will dress quite differently than if you work in a fast food restau-
           rant. When in doubt about what type clothing is suitable for your job, always lean
           toward dressing conservatively. Save your party clothes for parties. Save your torn
           jeans and old tees for hanging out with friends.


                     No matter what type of clothes you wear to work, you do not have to
                     spend a fortune on your wardrobe. Wearing well-fitted and appropriate
           clothes will go a long way toward presenting yourself successfully. It does not mat-
           ter how much you spend; what matters most is how your clothes fit you and your
           environment.


              Make sure you are groomed. This means your hair and fingernails are clean
           and neat; your face, body, and teeth are clean; your clothes are clean and pressed;

         If you do not have a full-length mirror, buy one. Look in it every day be-
         fore you leave home.



   Maintain a relaxed and open demeanor. You can wear nice clothes, be clean
and groomed, yet still convey a negative first impression. Your body language
counts as much as your grooming. Whether you present an angry, bored, or
friendly demeanor, it shows. Hold your head high, and keep your facial expres-
sions friendly. Make eye contact when talking with someone. Smile as often as
appropriate; smile often. A smile goes a long way, both personally and interper-
sonally. When you smile, you feel better. When you smile, you make others feel
better.
    Doing these three things will help your customers begin forming a positive
first impression of you. Doing these three things shows that you care about your-
self. What are your customers seeing?




HOW COULD BOB’S EMPLOYEES HAVE MADE A BETTER
FIRST IMPRESSION?

   Sally drives to Bob’s Electronic Store to purchase a new television set. She
   walks in and spots two employees stocking CDs on a display rack. They
   are dressed nicely and look happy, as they laugh and joke with each other
   while they work. They look at her, smile, and say, “Welcome to Bob’s.”

This time, Sally’s photo was developing nicely. The employees were well-
groomed, and their body language conveyed the message that they cared about
themselves. Their smiles conveyed the message that they cared about her. Sally
smiled back and said she was looking for a new television.

   101


                 oung children are praised for doing and saying the right things. When
           Y     a young child says please and thank you, people respond positively. When a
           young child says I’m sorry, people readily accept the apology. When children wait
           to speak without interrupting, people notice how well mannered they are. When
           children learn how to play well, people comment. Children who receive positive
           reinforcement develop valuable skills for getting along with others.
               As an adult, you are not going to receive constant praise for being courteous,
           but people will appreciate your behavior. When you act courteously, you send a
           positive and powerful message. When you make a conscious effort to use cour-
           tesy words and phrases, they will soon become a natural part of your vocabulary
           and personality.
               Say please, thank you, and you’re welcome. As a child, you learned to say
           please when asking for something: Can I please have a glass of water? You learned
           to say please when you responded to others: Yes, please. You learned to say thank
           you when someone did something for you. You learned to say you’re welcome
           when someone thanked you for doing something. Make it a habit to incorporate
           these words into your vocabulary and use them frequently.
               Say excuse me and I’m sorry. Growing up you learned that when you did
           not understand someone, when someone was in your way, or when you in-
           advertently did something incorrectly, you said excuse me. When you did some-
           thing wrong or made a mistake you learned to say I’m sorry. Saying I’m sorry,
           in particular, is difficult for adults. Get in the habit of adding this to your vocab-
           ulary. The next time you do something wrong, say I’m sorry. Not only will you
           make the other person feel better, but you will feel better. These two words go a
           long way in repairing relationship damage.
               Use Sir and Ma’am. Using these words shows a sign of respect. When you
           call a person sir or ma’am, be careful how you accentuate these words. The wrong
           emphasis can make you sound sarcastic or condescending. The right emphasis
           can make you sound respectful.
               Use a person’s name when you know it. Everyone enjoys hearing his or her
           name, so if you know your customer’s name use it. Also be sure to give the cus-
           tomer your name.

    Say it with a smile. This is an old saying with a timely meaning. In today’s
fast-paced world, smiling when you speak does come across loud and clear.
Whether you are speaking face to face or by telephone, your customers will see
or hear the smile in your voice.



        There are also things you should not do in the presence of customers.
        They include talking on a personal call, smoking, eating (or having food at
your work station), and chewing gum.




HOW COULD BOB’S EMPLOYEES HAVE INCORPORATED BASIC
COURTESIES INTO THEIR CONVERSATION WITH SALLY?

   Sally smiles back and says, “I’m looking for a new television, but there
   are so many new types I really don’t know what I’m looking for. Can you
   help me?”
       “Yes Ma’am, my name is Jeff, and I’ll be happy to help you,” says one
   of the employees as he smiles warmly and walks toward her. “Let me show
   you what we have.” He walks with her to the television sets.

Jeff was courteous, and his first words made Sally feel he truly cared about help-
ing her.

TRAINING                 STEP 3:     Attitude Is Everything
   101


                eople may not remember the color of the shirt you wore or the exact words
           P    you said, but they will remember your attitude. Projecting a positive attitude
           is another way to make a good—and long-lasting—impression on others. It
           really is all in the presentation. The it factor is the attitude you present to the
           world.
               Attitude is everything. Good or bad. Whether yours is good or bad, your
           attitude is what people are going to remember about you. When you interact with
           customers, you may not get a second chance. Even if you are not a naturally pos-
           itive person you can learn to have a more positive attitude. It begins by learning
           to appreciate.
               Appreciate the good in yourself and in others. Appreciation can be learned
           by changing your self-talk (the words you use when you think) to positive
           thoughts. This goes for thoughts about yourself: Change I’ll never do this right to
           Next time I’ll do better. This also goes for thoughts about your customers: Look
           at this old lady. She doesn’t look like she has a clue about television sets. This is
           going to be a tough one to handle. Change this mindset to I’ll do what I can to help
           this customer. She mentioned she doesn’t know a whole lot about all the new type
           sets, so I’ll do my best to explain them all. Changing your self-talk helps you ap-
           preciate yourself and others. When you find yourself falling into old habits of
           negative self-talk, make a conscious effort to change your thought process.
               Believe in yourself. When you stop your negative self-talk, you will start to
           believe in yourself. Saying things such as, I’ll never do this right, only sets you
           up for failure. Changing your self-talk to Next time I’ll do it differently sets you up
           for success. When you begin to believe in yourself, you will begin to feel more
           confident. When you feel more confident, you will begin projecting a powerful
           image to others. To your customers, you will project an image of someone who
           believes in yourself, your company, and your products.
               Believe you can make a difference. When you believe in yourself and gain
           confidence, you will naturally progress to believing that you can make a differ-
           ence in the lives of others. When you believe you can make a difference, you will
           find ways to make it happen. At work, look for ways to make a difference by be-
           ing helpful, interested, and caring toward your customers.

tough to handle, he was accepting a negative stereotype about older people
before he talked to her. That older woman might be smarter and sharper than he
is. Remember first impressions? Stereotypes can skew first impressions. Do you
want people to stereotype you? When you change your thought process and stop
stereotyping others, you will change the way you present yourself.



           Stress can easily zap anyone’s positive attitude. If you find yourself getting
           stressed at work, try to get away from the situation for a few minutes.
Getting away will not only help you calm down, it will help put things in perspec-
tive. The best remedy for keeping stress at bay, though, is to take care of you every
day. Get enough rest. Exercise your body and mind. Eat healthy foods. Do some-
thing fun. Do something just for you. When you do these things every day, you will
have a better outlook and be able to keep stress at arm’s length.




          We all carry emotional baggage.When you arrive at work, leave your emo-
          tional baggage at the door. Never make your customers and coworkers
suffer because you are having a problem. Remember that everyone has problems.
Use your work time to let go of personal baggage.




HOW COULD BOB’S EMPLOYEE HAVE SHOWN A
POSITIVE ATTITUDE?

   As they walk to the television sets, Jeff asks, “Have you been to Bob’s be-

   decided to come in. Not only do we offer the lowest prices around, we
   stand behind all our merchandise.”

                            Ethical Issues                                                   THE BASICS




     he last step of customer service basics deals with ethics. Being ethical
T    means being honest, doing the right thing, and being accountable for your
actions.
    Always be honest. Being honest at all times will make your life far less com-
plicated. When you are truthful, you do not have to remember what you said to
whom. Being truthful is important to your customers. When you are dishonest,
people find out. Maybe not right away, but the truth always has a way of coming
out. When people find out you have not been completely honest, they will no
longer trust you.
    Do the right thing. When you make the decision to always do the right thing
for others, you will go out of your way to do your best. At work, when you are
faced with a dilemma, base your decision on doing what is right and ethical. Be-
ing ethical includes treating all your customers fairly and equally.



           One of your customers asks you for a special favor. Doing so will mean
           crossing the ethical line. How do you tactfully refuse? You could say, “I don’t
feel comfortable doing that because it is against our company’s policy.” If the customer
persists, ask your manager for help.



   Do what you say you will when you say you will. Become a person others
can rely on. When you give a customer your word, mean it. Let your word be your
bond. Erase the words I can’t and no from your vocabulary. If you cannot do what
the customer asks, explain instead what you can do. It is all right to say “I don’t
know.” Follow up with “I’ll find out for you.”



          Always be truthful about your products, services, and policies. Never
          make misleading claims.
  34
CUSTOMER
 SERVICE
TRAINING
   101              Never comment negatively about your competitors. If a customer asks
                    for a comparison or leads you to say something negative, say, “I don’t
           know about that but let me explain our policy. . . .” or “I don’t know enough about that to
           comment.”



              Be accountable for your actions. If you think you have done something in-
           correct or unethical, be up front and talk it over with your manager. When you
           take responsibility and own up to your mistakes, people will respect you. No one
           expects you to make the right decision 100% of the time. We are all human and
           are all going to make mistakes. What sets ethical people apart is that they hold
           themselves accountable for their mistakes. This may not be easy at first, but it is
           the right thing to do. People will appreciate that you are able to admit you did
           something wrong. You will also have an added benefit: You will respect yourself
           more when you take responsibility for your actions.




           HOW COULD BOB’S EMPLOYEE DEAL WITH AN ETHICAL ISSUE?

              Sally is ready to buy. She says, “I heard that JB Appliances gives four free
              DVDs when you purchase a television. I’ll buy from you if you give me
              some DVDs.”
                  How does Jeff handle this? He is not familiar with JB’s policy so he
              should not say, “JB offers that because they sell their televisions at a
              higher price, and they don’t stand behind their merchandise. I’ve heard
              complaints about them.” Never comment about another company.
                  Or . . . he might say, “Well, we usually don’t do that, but for you I’ll
              make an exception.” Never offer a special deal unless you are willing to ex-
              tend it to all of your customers. Imagine if you do this and Sally tells her
              friend, who bought a television set from Bob’s yesterday. He is not going
              to be happy that he was not offered the free DVDs.
                  Now here is what Jeff can say, “I’m not familiar with what JB Appli-
              ances offers, but here’s what we offer. We always keep our merchandise
              priced low to consistently give our customers the best deal.”

What Is Ethical?
Do you know what is considered ethical, and more importantly, unethical, in
your business? If you are unclear, discuss specific situations that are unethical. In
today’s business climate, every employee should be completely certain they know
the difference.




When You Unwittingly Do Something Unethical
One of your customers asks you to do something special or unusual, such as
waiving a service fee. You willingly comply, but later realize that you crossed
ethical boundaries. How do you handle the situation? Do you call the customer
and retract the favor? Do you extend the favor to all customers, having done it
for one?
    Discuss how to handle sticky situations you may encounter. As a group, come
up with suggested responses. Role play to reinforce ethical behavior.

Have you ever formed a wrong first impression?

Calvin walked into a tire store. He spotted two employees, one on the showroom
floor straightening up the displays and another behind the counter keying on a
computer. He liked the look of the employee behind the counter, but he did not
like the look of the floor employee. Without even thinking about it, Calvin be-
gan forming first impressions of both employees.
    The employee on the showroom floor looked at Calvin, smiled warmly and
said, “Hi, welcome to Westview Tire.”
    Calvin ignored him and walked to the counter. No way do I want him helping
me, Calvin thought, not the way he looks. He waited for the other employee, who
was busy inputting information, to look up. Calvin waited. And waited.
    While he was waiting, another customer came in. The floor employee smiled
and said, “Hi, welcome to Westview Tire. How can I help you?”
    Calvin, continuing to wait, noticed that the employee helping the customer
went out of his way to explain the different types of tires. Actually, Calvin thought,
maybe I judged him incorrectly. He’s doing a great job explaining the different tires.
The employee was knowledgeable and answered all the customer’s questions
while Calvin continued to wait.
    Finally Calvin said, “Excuse me, can you help me?”
    Without looking up, the man behind the counter blandly said, “I’ll be with
you as soon as I’m done.”
    Meanwhile, the floor employee began writing up the other customer’s work
order.
    Hmm, Calvin thought, I definitely was wrong about him. He really is doing a
great job helping that person.
    The employee looked up from his computer. “OK, I’m done. What do you
need?” No smile. No hello.
    “That’s all right,” Calvin said, “I don’t want to bother you. I’ll wait until he’s
done.”

Calvin learned a valuable lesson about people. He began forming his first im-
pression based on a stereotype he had about the way the floor employee looked,
rather than noticing the employee’s courteous actions and positive attitude.
  40
CUSTOMER
 SERVICE      On the other hand, perhaps the floor employee did not present a favorable
TRAINING
           image to foster a positive first impression. Because Calvin formed a negative first
   101
           impression, the employee had to show him, through his actions, that Calvin was
           wrong in his opinion. By being courteous and having a helpful attitude, the em-
           ployee was able to change Calvin’s initial impression.

Tossing the Ball Back and Forth:
Effective Communication
             IN YOUR DEALINGS WITH CUSTOMERS,
                    BE THE ONE TO INITIATE
                   HONEST, RESPECTFUL,AND
               THOUGHTFUL COMMUNICATION.




D
           id you know that almost everything you do in life
           involves some form of communication? Anytime
           you interact with another person, you commu-
nicate. Whether you smile at a stranger, speak to a friend,
or listen attentively when someone is talking to you, you communicate. You can
even communicate by doing nothing at all. When you ignore someone, let a
door close on the person behind you, or look the other way when someone is
approaching, you communicate.
    We communicate for numerous reasons. We communicate when we need to
make decisions, solve problems, get answers, gather information, or resolve con-
flicts. We communicate when we want to find out how someone is doing, find
out what is happening, discuss important events, or get to know someone. A
smile communicates volumes. So does a scowl. Communicating is so important
a person’s success often depends on good communication skills.

                      How Well Do You Communicate?
As a front-line employee, you are your customers’ point of contact and their pri-
mary communication source. To them, you not only represent the company, you
are the company.
                                                                                    43
  44
CUSTOMER
 SERVICE      As your company’s communicator, how you communicate with your cus-
TRAINING
           tomers is important. In fact, it is your most important job. Relationships develop
   101
           when effective communication is established. You will learn about building rela-
           tionships in Chapter 3, but first you will learn valuable communication skills.
           Communication forms the basis of any relationship; at work, learning how to
           communicate effectively is imperative when you deal with customers.
              The easiest way to communicate is when you are face to face with people. You
           have the advantage of picking up cues about a person’s moods and can adjust
           your conversation accordingly. You also communicate by telephone and by
           writing E-mails and letters. You do have an advantage when communicating
           through E-mail or writing because you can read—and change—what you write
           before sending it. When speaking face to face, you have no backspace or delete
           key to change your message. It is crucial in verbal communication that you say
           exactly what you mean to say. Using good grammar helps communicate the
           correct message.

              Try this verbal communication exercise: Ask the following question out loud
              in an enthusiastic tone.
                  “Can I help you?”

              Repeat it in:
                 An unsure tone
                 An angry tone
                 A disinterested tone

           Notice how the same four words take on four very different meanings, depen-
           ding on your voice tone. How you say something is even more important than
           the words you choose. How you say something can help—or hinder—the effec-
           tiveness of your communication.
               Besides verbal communication, you can also communicate without saying a
           word. When communicating face to face, your body language accounts for a
           major portion of communication. Nonverbal communication, including your
           posture, facial expressions, and hand and eye movements are all manners of com-
           municating. You may say one thing, but communicate something else. Words
           communicate a message; body language communicates the emotions behind the
           message.

             When you look directly at someone and smile, you convey interest.
              When you slump and yawn, you convey boredom. When you lower
             your eyes to the floor, you convey disinterest or dishonesty. When you
                stand with your arms folded in front of you, you build an imagi-
                 nary wall between you and the other person. You can say the right
                 words, but still convey the wrong message.
    It is also important that what you are saying is being inter-
preted the way you mean it. How many times has someone taken
your message the wrong way? When that happens, it takes more
of your time and energy to correct the listener’s interpretation of
your meaning. When you speak, it is important that you choose
your words carefully. When you listen, it is equally important that
you pay attention to what you hear.
    A large part of your communication with customers will be in the form of
asking questions. Knowing what questions to ask is crucial, but so is knowing
when to ask them. The tone you use when you ask a question is also as impor-
tant as the words you choose.

       Steve stops at the local deli for lunch. He is in a hurry to place the
       order for himself and his coworkers and is greeted by an employee
       who yawns as he looks at Steve. Scratching his head with his pencil,
       he says, “Hey man, whaddyawant?”
          “I’m in a hurry. Is it possible to get my order quickly?”
          The employee shrugs nonchalantly. “I suppose so. We’re not that
       busy right now.”

   101
                 the employee keeps looking at the door whenever someone comes
                 in. Steve finishes his order, “a ham on rye with mustard and a pas-
                 trami on rye with mustard.”
                     The employee says, “OK, a ham on rye and a pastrami on rye.
                 What do you want on ’em?”
                     As Steve says “mustard” he wonders if the employee got the rest
                 of the order. “Did you get the turkey and Swiss, the roast beef, and
                 the tuna salad?”
                     Without looking up, he says “Yeah” in an agitated voice. The em-
                 ployee strolls slowly to the backroom with Steve’s order.
                     Before Steve leaves, he checks his order because he is not certain
                 the employee got it right.


           What Went Wrong?

           Steve felt he was talking to himself and that the employee was not listening. The
           employee looked tired, bored, and was more interested in seeing who was com-
           ing in than helping Steve. His choice of words and poor grammar did nothing to
           help Steve feel confident that the order would be right.

portant. When your primary job is to be your company’s communicator, you                 COMMUNICATION
project your company’s image to the customers. In this chapter you will learn
valuable tools to help you become a more effective communicator. The six steps
to effective communication are:

         STEP 1: Saying What You Mean and Meaning What You Say
         STEP 2:What You Don’t Say: Nonverbal Communication
         STEP 3: Putting Words Together: Grammar Usage
         STEP 4:Asking the Correct Questions and Answering the
                 Questions Correctly
         STEP 5:When the Customer Says No
         STEP 6: Listening Actively

If the deli employee had communicated more effectively, Steve would have had
more confidence that his order was correct. Although he was in a hurry to get
back to his office, he took the time to check his order before leaving the deli.

You may have answered the questions above something like this:

   How do you think Steve felt after giving his order?
      Because the employee paid more attention to who was coming and going,
   he had no confidence that the employee got the order right.

   How did Steve feel about this deli when he left?
       The business owner/manager/employee did not care about him as a
   customer.
       The owner/manager did not care about the way their employees handled
   customers.

   101
                          and Meaning What You Say
                    hen you communicate, you can either speak or listen. It is impossible to
           W        do both well at the same time. As the speaker, you control the conversa-
           tion. You have the listener’s interest—as long as you are saying something that is
           receptive. As the speaker, it is your responsibility to get your message across the
           way you mean it. You may not get a second chance to explain.
               Choose the right words. In other words, think before you speak. Choose
           words that will be understandable to the listener. When you speak to a toddler,
           you choose words that are understandable for that age level. When you speak to
           a customer who may not be familiar with your company or products, choosing
           the right words will help convey the correct message. Opt for easy and familiar
           words. Trying to impress people with big words may only add confusion to your
           message.
               Make sure your tone fits the message you are sending. How you say some-
           thing is more important than what you say. When you did the verbal exercise and
           asked a question four different ways, you got four different meanings. In addi-
           tion to choosing the right words, think about how you want to say the words.
           When you talk to someone and use the wrong tone, your message will be mis-
           interpreted. Use a serious, helpful tone when speaking to a customer who is upset.
           Use an enthusiastic tone when asking a customer if you can help. When asking
           questions, use a tone that shows you are truly interested in the answer. Pay atten-
           tion to your listener’s nonverbal cues to make sure your tone fits your customer.
               Add welcome words to your vocabulary. When you use words that sound
           positive and confident, you will project a positive and confident attitude. Words
           and phrases like Yes!, I’ll be happy to!, and Sure I can! send a message to your cus-
           tomers that you really are happy to help them. Words like definitely and absolutely
           send a message that you are enthusiastic and interested. It is difficult to say defi-
           nitely without showing conviction and interest. It is difficult to say absolutely
           without showing enthusiasm. Interjecting these and other welcome words into
           your conversation convey a sense of conviction that you truly want to help.
               Keep business conversations professional. When you interact with cus-
           tomers, draw the line between being professional and getting personal. Even

          When you are speaking with a customer of a different culture who does
          not understand what you are saying, speak in the same tone and voice
level but choose different words to convey your message. Repeating the same
words over and over will most likely frustrate the customer—and you.




HOW COULD THE EMPLOYEE HAVE OPENED THE
CONVERSATION DIFFERENTLY?
   Steve stops at the local deli for lunch. He is in a hurry to place the order
   for himself and his coworkers and is greeted by an employee who looks at
   him, smiles, and enthusiastically says, “Hi, Welcome to Max’s Deli. How
   are you doing?”
       “I’m doing great, thanks, but I am in a hurry. Is it possible to get my order
   quickly?”
       “Absolutely. I’ll put a rush on it. What can I get you?”

This time the employee chose words that were appropriate and he conveyed en-
thusiasm in his tone. Adding absolutely gave Steve confidence that the employee
meant what he said.

                          STEP 2:
   101
                         Nonverbal Communication
                 ow you say something is more important than the words you choose, but
           H     what you do when you convey a message is also important. You can choose
           the right words and use an appropriate tone, but convey an entirely different
           message through nonverbal communication. In the nonverbal exercise, you used
           four different mannerisms when you spoke to your customer. You said one thing,
           but sent four entirely different messages.
               Actions speak louder than words. You may have a great attitude and per-
           sonality, but your actions will leave a lasting impression on your customers.
           Always be aware of your body language to make sure you are sending the right
           nonverbal messages.
               Smile often. A smile is one of the most powerful messages you can send. A
           smile translates into any language, to any age group, across any culture. Smile
           and people will smile back at you. Try it. It does work. Get in the habit of smiling
           often. When you make it a habit to smile, your smile will look natural, not forced.
           A forced smile looks phony; sometimes a forced smile looks frozen on your face.
           When you smile often, your smile will become a natural part of your demeanor.
               Make eye contact. This is one of the most important components of com-
           munication, yet it can be a tough habit to get into. If you are uncomfortable
           making eye contact when you speak, first try to get into the habit of making eye
           contact when you listen. Nod, smile, stay interested. When you are comfortable
           doing that, make a conscious effort to look at the other person when you speak.
           When your eyes stray, bring them back. Wandering eyes sends a message that you
           are bored or more interested in someone or something other than the person you
           are with. Making eye contact is a powerful tool. Eye contact shows you are inter-
           ested, honest, and confident.
               Maintain good posture. Standing straight also sends the message that you
           are confident. Get in the habit of holding your head high, but keep it in a relaxed
           position. When you hold your head comfortably high, your body will naturally
           have good posture. Try this posture exercise: pretend you have a string attached
           to the top of your head. Imagine the string is being pulled straight up until you
           are standing tall and holding your head in a comfortable position. When you find
           yourself slumping, do the string exercise.

unable to focus and listen. When you are rested you will think clearly, care about
the way you look, have a positive attitude, and stay attentive.
    Keep your energy level steady. Think about your energy level. Do you have
high energy in the morning, but become tired after lunch? Are you numb until
you have your morning coffee? Do you have mood swings? Eating sugar in the
morning causes some people to crash before lunch. Eating a heavy lunch causes
some people to crash in the afternoon. Try changing your diet to healthy and nu-
tritious foods that will give you long-lasting energy. When you start feeling tired
at work, try doing a few stretches. These can even be done inconspicuously at
your desk or work station. Maintaining good posture also helps keep your energy
level up.




HOW COULD THE EMPLOYEE HAVE IMPROVED HIS
NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION?

   Steve begins to give his order.“I’ll have a turkey and Swiss on whole wheat
   with mayo and tomatoes. . . .” As he speaks he notices that the employee
   looks directly at him before writing down the item. He smiles often, his
   posture tells Steve he is interested, and he nods occasionally as Steve
   speaks.

This time he sent a message to Steve that he was interested in him as a customer.

   101
                                    Grammar Usage
                roper grammar is critical to effective communication. When you use proper
           P    grammar, it is easier to send the right message. Save the “Hey man” and
           “Whaddyawant” for your friends.
               Reflect your company’s personality. At work you are the voice for your
           business, and you should always choose words that reflect your company’s per-
           sonality. In a deli setting, the business personality will be fairly casual. In a five-
           star restaurant, it will be more formal. If you are unclear how you should speak to
           customers, how friendly or casual you should be, ask your manager for guidance.
               Speak clearly. Using overly casual terms or running words together can be
           difficult for some people to understand. Get in the habit of always sounding out
           words in their correct form. Say “Hello” or “Hi” in place of “Hey man.” Say “What
           would you like to order?” or “How can I help you?” in place of “Whaddyawant?”
           Speak clearly, and you will present yourself as an intelligent, competent person.
               Use everyday language. In Step 1, you learned that choosing the right words
           helps you send the right message to your listener. When you have a choice be-
           tween two words, always opt for the simpler of the two. Keep your words short
           and simple whenever you can. They are easy for everyone to understand, and you
           do not risk the chance of sending the wrong message.
               Avoid using slang, jargon, company terms, and technical language. Your
           customers are not likely to know company terms, acronyms, and jargon, so stick
           to common, generic words. Most customers will not understand the technical
           terms you use. When you need to give technical explanations convert difficult-
           to-understand words into words to which your customer will relate. Always speak
           the language that your customers will understand. Try to match your speech to
           each customer’s level of comprehension.

TRAINING    STEP 4:Asking the Correct Questions and
   101
                Answering the Questions Correctly
                    e ask questions for many reasons. As customers, we ask questions to
           W        gather new information and acquire additional information. Employees
           ask questions to figure out how to solve a customer’s problem or to resolve a cus-
           tomer’s complaint.
               There are two types of questions: open and closed. Open questions require
           more than a yes or no answer and encourage the responder to give information.
           Closed questions require only a one word or short answer and are often used for
           clarification.
               Keep your questions simple. Stick to one type of question. When you lump
           the two types of questions together,you run the risk that your customers may not
           register all the responses. If a question is long and involved, break it down. When
           you need to ask a series of questions, try interjecting some of the following state-
           ments in place of questions, so you will not sound as though you are interro-
           gating your customer with a barrage of questions.

                  “Tell me about. . . .”
                  “Tell me more.”
                  “I’d like to get more information on. . . .”
                  “Describe. . . .”

              Ask open questions when you need information. Questions that require
           more than a one word or short answer will get the customer talking. Open ques-
           tions begin with what, why, and how. Use open questions when you need infor-
           mation from a customer. Use open questions when you begin the questioning
           process to encourage your customer to talk.

                  “How do you. . . .”
                  “What would you like. . . .”
                  “What else. . . .”
                  “What are. . . .”

       “What type. . . .”                                                                  COMMUNICATION




          Be careful when asking a “why” question. For example, “Why do you want
          to do that?” may put your customer on the defensive. She might reply, “It’s
none of your business.” Smiling and using a reflective or helpful tone indicates you are
asking out of interest to learn more about your customer’s needs.



   Ask closed questions to control the conversation. When you need short
answers to clarify information or when you need a specific yes, no, or short an-
swer, choose closed questions. Questions beginning with is, are, do, can, or will
require only a yes or no answer. Questions beginning with who, would, how, or
where require a short answer. Closed questions are good to use toward the end of
the questioning portion of your contact to narrow down the information you
need to help your customer.

       “Are you. . . .”
       “Do you think. . . .”
       “Will you. . . .”
       “Would you like. . . .”
       “Where do you. . . .”
       “How many. . . .”
       “Who will. . . .”

   Before answering a customer’s question, make sure you understand it. If
you do not clearly understand the question, recap the question or ask a clarify-
ing question rather than guessing an answer. It is better to ask another question
than to answer the wrong question. Also, never answer a question unless you are
sure your answer is accurate. It is better to say “I don’t know,” than to give an
answer that may be incorrect. If you do not know, say so; follow up with “I’ll find
out for you.”
   Try to give more than a one word answer. No matter which questioning
technique customers use, try to answer as though the question is open ended. Try
  56

 SERVICE   to give customers sufficient information to help them make decisions. Giving
TRAINING
           more than a one word answer can have an added bonus: You can generate sales.

           For example, if Steve asks, “Do you have potato salad?” The employee can an-
           swer “Yes.” Or . . . “We sure do. We also have coleslaw, baked beans, and pasta salad.”
           Now Steve has many options from which to choose. He may decide to order, not
           only the potato salad, but other sides as well, helping to improve the deli’s bot-
           tom line.



                      Try to erase the words I can’t from your vocabulary. Always try to focus
                      on what you can do. If a customer asks you to do something you cannot
           do, say, “Here’s what I can do for you. . . .”




                      When a customer asks for another employee who is not available, never
                      say that the employee is at lunch, on break, went home early, has not
           come in yet, or that you do not know where the employee is. Rather, say, “_____
           is unavailable now. How can I help you?” or “_____ is out of the office now. I’ll be happy to
           help you.”

TRAINING        STEP 5:     When the Customer Says No
   101


                 ou will absolutely, definitely, positively, have to handle customers who say
           Y     no. When you offer a valid solution and your customer says no, your job is
           to uncover the reasons for your customer’s objections. If you work in sales, it may
           also be your job to find ways to convince the customer to say yes. The bottom
           line, always, is to do what is right for your customer. Never offer or try to sell a
           customer something she does not need just to make a sale. When you get to the
           real reason for the objection, you will figure out the best solution for that partic-
           ular customer.
                Listen to the customer’s objection. When a customer says no, an objection
           is made to your proposed solution. To learn the reason behind the no, ask a com-
           bination of open and closed questions.You need to understand why the customer
           is saying no so you can best help her. For example, you just made a sales proposal
           for a complete home security system, and the customer says no. You might ask,
           “What type of security are you interested in for your home?” The customer’s re-
           sponses might be: “Something a little cheaper” or “This one seems too complicated
           for my needs.”
                Acknowledge the objection. Always validate the customer’s reason, then re-
           spond with a positive statement. “I can understand the price may seem high, but
           our system offers full security in case of fire and break in. When you consider that,
           it isn’t as expensive as it seems.” Or “At first it may seem complicated, but once you
           learn how to use it, it becomes second nature.” Doing this shows you empathize
           with the customer’s objection, while adding another benefit to the solution you
           proposed.
                Follow up with a question. The customer objected. You listened to the cus-
           tomer’s objection, acknowledged it, and gave more information about your pro-
           posal. Next, you need to follow up. “How does that sound?” “What do you think
           about that?” By following up with a clarifying question, you will know how to
           proceed.
                Consider the customer’s answer. The customer’s response will determine
           whether she is objecting because she does not agree with your proposal or whether
           she is looking for more information. If the customer responds with something
           like, “How much did you say it will cost?” she is interested in more information
           about the product. However, if she answers, “I really can’t afford that,” proceed

           Always be truthful when stating your point of view or the benefits of a
           product. In other words, never try to make a sale or glorify the point you
are trying to make to get the customer to agree with you. When you are not truth-
ful, you will come across in a phony manner and the customer will figure out what
you are doing.




HOW COULD THE EMPLOYEE HANDLE STEVE’S OBJECTION?
   “Would you like any other sides?”
       “No thanks.”
       “Nothing for anyone else?”
       “No one mentioned anything. I wouldn’t know what to order.”
       “I understand, but potato salad would be a good choice. We do have a
   larger size.”
       “Hmm, I’m not sure.”
       “The larger size only costs a dollar more than the price for the side or-
   der size. How does that sound?”
       “Only a dollar more? OK, that sounds good.”
       “Great. Just one more thing, do you want spicy or regular mustard?”
       “Regular.”

When Steve said no, the employee gave him another option, then asked a follow-
up question. If Steve said no again, it would be time to move on.

TRAINING                      STEP 6:     Listening Actively
   101


             n Step 1, you learned that it is impossible to speak and listen at the same time
           I and do both well. Did you ever try to do both at the same time? Not easy, is it?
           Speaking is important because you are delivering a message, but listening is often
           more important than speaking. Without the ability to listen well, communica-
           tion can never be effective. If you do not listen to the message, you might easily
           give the wrong response.
               Focus entirely on your customer. Think of the customer you are helping
           as the only customer in your business. When you do this, you will be able to give
           your full attention to that customer. When you are listening to the customer, stay
           interested, even if your customer’s message is long. When that happens, you can
           show empathy in your facial expressions or by nodding to show you are staying
           with the customer. When you nod occasionally and say something like, “I see,”
           “tell me more,” or “hmm,” you show you are still listening. If your customer
           rambles or gets off track, you may politely interrupt and ask some clarifying
           questions to take control of the conversation.



                     If someone else interrupts you, and it is an avoidable interruption, explain
                     to the interrupter that you will be with him as soon as you are done help-
           ing your customer. If it is an unavoidable interruption, excuse yourself momentarily
           from your customer to answer the other person. Quickly return your attention and
           apologize for the interruption.



               Listen completely. When you try to listen and talk at the same time, you do
           not do either one effectively. Pay attention to the speaker. You are going to get the
           ball tossed back to you and, when it is your turn to speak, you will want the other
           person to pay attention to you. Try not to think of your response when the
           speaker is still talking. Wait until the message is winding down before thinking
           how you want to respond. Unless you hear the customer’s complete statement or
           question, you might come up with the incorrect response.
               Remain objective; do not judge. Before coming to a conclusion or making a
           judgment, gather as much information as you can. This will help you avoid jump-
                                                                                            61

             Never assume you know what your customers want. If you are unsure,
             ask a clarifying question.



   Listen for what is not said. You learned about nonverbal communication
and how important it is to pay attention to your mannerisms. It is also impor-
tant to pay attention to your customers’ nonverbal signals to see if their words
match their emotions. Pay attention to what your customers are really saying. If
a customer appears on edge, upset, or angry, show empathy in your replies.




HOW COULD THE EMPLOYEE SHOW HE WAS
ACTIVELY LISTENING?

   “OK, you mentioned you were in a hurry so I’ll put a rush on your order.
   It should be out very soon.”

Throughout their interaction, the employee made eye contact as he wrote down
Steve’s order. He asked questions to clarify the order. He could tell Steve was in a
hurry, so he responded accordingly.

       Steve stops at the local deli for lunch. He is in a hurry to place the
       order for himself and his coworkers and is greeted by an employee
       who looks at him, smiles, and enthusiastically says, “Hi, Welcome to
       Max’s Deli. How are you doing?”
          “I’m doing great, thanks, but I am in a hurry. Is it possible to get
       my order quickly?”

                     Steve begins to give his order, “I’ll have a turkey and Swiss on
   101
                 whole wheat with mayo and tomatoes. . . .” As he speaks he notices
                 the employee looks directly at him, before writing down the item. He
                 smiles often, his posture tells Steve he is interested, and he nods
                 occasionally as Steve speaks.
                     The customer finishes his order, “a ham on rye with mustard and
                 a pastrami on rye with mustard.”
                     “What else would you like?”
                     “Do you have potato salad?”
                     “We sure do. We also have cole slaw, baked beans, and pasta
                 salad.”
                     “I’ll take a side order of potato salad.”
                     “Would you like any other sides?”
                     “No thanks.”
                     “Nothing for anyone else?”
                     “No one mentioned anything. I wouldn’t know what to order.”
                     “I understand, but potato salad would be a good choice. We do
                 have a larger size.”
                     “Hmm, I’m not sure.”
                     “The large size only costs a dollar more than the price for the
                 side order size. How does that sound?”
                     “Only a dollar more? OK, that sounds good.”
                     “Great. Just one more thing, do you want spicy or regular mustard?”
                     “Regular.”

           No matter where you work, you can apply the principles of communicating
           effectively to your interactions with your customers.

Have you ever assumed you know what your customers want?

Cindy and her husband, Jerry, met their friends for dinner at a restaurant they
were trying for the first time. They had not seen each other in a while and looked
forward to an enjoyable and relaxed evening.
    As soon as they were seated, the server came to take drink orders. He was
pleasant and quickly brought their drinks and bread. He explained the specials
and gave them a few minutes to decide.
    When he came back, Cindy ordered. “I’d like the salmon, please.”
    “Good choice,” the server replied.
    When the entrées came, Cindy was listening to her friend tell a story and did
not look at her plate until the server left. Cindy looked at her salmon. Confused,
she took a bite. Rather than having a mustard glaze, it was covered in tomatoes
and vegetables, which was not appealing to her.
    Discreetly, she looked around for the server. He was nowhere to be found.
    “What’s the matter?” Jerry asked, when he saw she was not eating her salmon.
    “This isn’t what I ordered. I’d eat it, but I don’t care for the way it tastes.”
    Jerry looked for the server. “It’s all right,” Cindy said, “don’t worry about it.”
She did not want to detract from their fun evening. She picked at the vegetables
as she waited for the server to come back.
    Jerry and their friends were almost through with their entrées when the server
strolled over to the table. “How is everything?” He asked with an air of confidence.
    “This isn’t what I ordered. It’s supposed to have a mustard glaze.”
    “This is one of the specials. I thought that’s what you wanted.”
    “No, I wanted the salmon on the regular menu.”
    “Oh. How about if I give you a free dessert to make up for that?” Not waiting
for a reply, he walked away.
    Cindy was upset. Jerry and their friends were appalled.
    “I can’t believe he didn’t offer to bring you what you wanted.”
    “Free dessert? He should have done something more to make up for that.”
    “He shouldn’t charge you for something you didn’t order.”
    When the server came back, he cleared the plates, looked at Cindy’s salmon,
and said with a chuckle,“I’m sure you don’t want that wrapped. What would you
like for dessert?”
  68

              Normally they were generous tippers. Not this evening. Not only did the

           right.
              Leaving the restaurant, they said, “With that kind of service, we won’t be
           back here anytime soon.”

Jumping in with Both Feet:
Relationship Building
            TO PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE SERVICE,
                 YOU MUST GET CLOSE TO YOUR
              CUSTOMERS BY BUILDING A STRONG
                   RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM.




D
          id you know that every customer contact results
          in a relationship? You may not realize it, but even
          when customers only do business with a com-
pany once, they remember and judge the company by their
relationship with the employees. Whether their relation-
ship is good or bad, they will remember. They are also likely to tell others. People
talk. They share their experiences with others.



                      What Are People Saying About You?
Relationship building is the cornerstone of customer service. Remember, to your
customers you are the company. Customers judge a business by their interactions
with its employees. From the moment a customer forms his first impression to
the moment you complete your interaction with him, you have a
valuable opportunity to build a strong relationship. The same ap-
plies to those customers who may not come back. When you inter-
act positively and go out of your way to help each customer, you
build a relationship. Those customers will remember the great
service and will tell others about their experiences.
                                                                                       71
  72
CUSTOMER
 SERVICE       When you are courteous and have a positive attitude toward your customers,
TRAINING
           you show that you care. When you demonstrate good communication skills by
   101
           thinking before you speak, keeping your nonverbal body language relaxed and
           open, and using correct grammar, you present yourself as intelligent and confi-
           dent. When you ask the correct questions to help the customer and answer all
           questions the customer asks you, you present yourself as a competent employee.
           When listening carefully, you demonstrate that you are truly interested in each
           and every customer.
               So far you are off to a good start. The next step is learning how to build rela-
           tionships. Customers, whether they do business with you repeatedly or only one
                                time, are all equally important. Every customer deserves the
                               same level of service.
                               You interact with customers in two ways. You work to build new
                          relationships, and you work to maintain ongoing relationships. Both
                          types of interactions are equally important. Without new business
                      relationships, your company will not grow. Without ongoing business
           relationships, you will not develop a loyal customer base. The principles of basic
           courtesies and effective communication result in building and maintaining pos-
           itive relationships.
               Your relationship begins when a customer forms a first impression of you and
           your company. It continues when you establish a rapport. Think, for a moment,
           about a personal relationship you are or were in. When you first met that special
           person, you probably made small talk to see if you had something in common.
           When you discovered that you shared common ground, you made the decision
           to take your relationship to the next level by going on a date.
               The purpose of business relationships, of course, is not to
           result in dates, but during those first few minutes with a cus-
           tomer it is equally important to find common ground to begin
           building a relationship. Establishing a rapport with your customer
           is the first step to finding something in common. You may do this by
           asking a question as simple as, “How are you today?,” and then listening to the
           customer’s response: “Fine, thanks,” or “I’m not doing well at all.”
               From these first few words with a customer, you have the opportunity to re-
           spond in a positive and upbeat manner. To the customer who is not doing well
           at all, you may say, “I’m sorry to hear that. How can I help you?” Showing interest

    When customers do repeat business, you have the opportunity to maintain          BUILDING
an on-going relationship by remembering them, by remembering something
about them, and by learning their tastes and preferences. And for the customer
who was not having a good day before, you might say, “Hi Mrs. Adams, I hope
you’re having a better day today.” Think how special Mrs. Adams will feel know-
ing that she was important enough to you to remember something about her.
    You will deal with many different types of customers. Learning how to inter-
act positively with various personality types will enable you to handle any type
of customer in any type of situation. You will be on your way to knowing how
to establish and maintain long-term, high-quality relationships with all your
customers.



                                                 PICTURE
                                                 THIS

      Sarah is an unlikely customer service employee. She is home from
      college for summer break and takes a part-time job at a women’s
      clothing shop in the local mall. Sarah has not worked in retail before,
      and she is unsure about how to interact with customers. Her new job
      is to greet customers and help them find what they need. On her first
      day, her manager explains her job duties, shows her where to locate
      stock in the backroom, and tells her to be friendly to customers.
           “Be sure you say hi to the customers when they come in,” her
      manager says as she walks away.
           Sarah busies herself folding tops on the front display table.
           Beth Adams, meanwhile, is outside the store looking at the
      clothing display in the window. She comes into the store and no-
      tices Sarah.
           This is Sarah’s first customer. She nervously says, “Hi.” She barely
      speaks above a whisper as she quickly glances at the woman and then
      back down to her work. Sarah continues to fold the tops while the
      woman browses.

                    Sarah nods, takes the item from Beth and retreats into the stock
                 room without saying a word or making eye contact. When Sarah
                 comes back she says, “Sorry, we don’t have it.” She speaks softly and
                 looks at the floor as she speaks.
                    “Oh, all right. Well, thanks for checking.” Beth walks out of the
                 store.


           What Went Wrong?

           Even though Sarah knew she would have to deal with customers, she did not
           understand the importance of building customer relationships. She wanted to
           work in this clothing store to get the employee discount. She never gave much
           thought to the job duties or the customers.
               Her manager showed Sarah where to locate stock in the backroom, showed
           her how to keep the displays neat, and told her to be friendly to the customers.
           But, what exactly does being friendly mean? To the manager, it might mean some-
           thing quite different than what Sarah thinks. Unless Sarah knows specifically
           how she is supposed to interact with customers, she most likely will assume she
           is being friendly.


              How Did the Customer Feel?

              How do you think Sarah made the customer feel from the time she came into
              the store until the time she left ?

tablish a rapport, you need to define three things: Who your customers are; what          BUILDING
they expect from your business; and how your company’s products and services
enhance their lives. When you understand these three things, you will understand
your customers’ general needs and wants. As a result, you will have a better idea
of how to establish a rapport, how to find common ground and relate to your
customers, and how to build strong relationships.
    Sarah’s motivation for working in this store was to get the employee discount.
She never thought about the customers she would be helping. She did not under-
stand who her customers were. Were they one-time shoppers or did the store get
a lot of repeat business? How did they expect to be treated when they came in? If
the store was an expensive designer boutique, the customers would have differ-
ent expectations than a store that mass markets inexpensive items.
    Sarah did not understand what the customers expected from her or the store.
How involved was she supposed to be with customers? Was she supposed to help
them select outfits? Or did customers come in to browse and want to be left
alone? Would she be dealing with the same customers regularly? If so, it would
be important for Sarah to introduce herself and get to know her customers and
their individual tastes and styles.
    Sarah never thought about how the store’s products would enhance its cus-
tomers’ lives. Knowing this would enable Sarah to help her customers. If this was
an expensive boutique where the customers were interested in labels, Sarah could
show customers where to find certain designer items. If the store stocked trendy
items, Sarah could show customers the newest items and the hot sellers.
    Even in a clothing store where customers may only visit randomly, employ-
ees can work on developing relationships with them. Unless Sarah learns some
things about her customers, she is going to have a difficult time helping them.
Every customer interaction, even short-term ones like Sarah’s, results in a relation-
ship. Customers judge a business through their relationships.

           Most likely Beth did not leave the store with a warm and fuzzy feeling. Sarah
           did nothing to make Beth want to hurry back. Sarah was unsure how she was
           supposed to act around customers, but anyone, even someone who is as inexpe-
           rienced as Sarah, can learn to build positive relationships with customers.
               By learning the six steps below you will learn how to build and maintain
           positive and strong relationships with all your customers.

               STEP 1: Establishing Rapport
               STEP 2: Interacting Positively with Customers
               STEP 3: Identifying Customers’ Needs
               STEP 4: Making the Customer Feel Valued
               STEP 5: Maintaining Ongoing Relationships
               STEP 6: Different Strokes: Handling Different Types of Customers

           In Sarah’s contact with Beth, she could have done many things differently.
           Sarah also could have asked her manager what she meant when she said to “be
           friendly.”

In answer to the questions, you may have written:                                        IN WITH

   How do you think Sarah made the customer feel, from the time she came into           BUILDING
   the store until the time she left ?
       Sarah did not make a good first impression. She should have made eye
   contact with the customer. She should have smiled and greeted the customer
   to show she was interested in her. When the customer asked for help, she
   should have said, “I’ll be happy to check on that,” or “Absolutely. I’ll be glad
   to see if we have that.”

   How do you think Sarah’s customer judged her relationship with the store?
       The customer felt Sarah and the store management did not care about
   her. She did not seem very satisfied when she left the store.

Finally, think about this. How could Sarah be sure that she understood her rela-
tionship to the customers? She could have asked her manager questions during
her training. For example, when the manager said to be friendly, Sarah could have
asked, “Am I supposed to ask all the customers if they need help?” This would also
show her manager that she was interested in doing a good job.

TRAINING                  STEP 1:     Establishing Rapport
   101


                stablishing a rapport begins the moment you start communicating with your
           E    customers. Smiling at a customer can help establish a rapport by showing
           you are interested. How you establish a rapport depends on your customer inter-
           actions. Think about how you answered these questions: Who are your cus-
           tomers; what do they expect from your company; and how do your company’s
           products and services enhance their lives?
               Who are your customers? Are they men, women, tweens, teens, young adults,
           or all age groups?
               What do they expect from your company? Quality products? Good value? The
           best prices? Quick service? Products that will enhance their self-image? A large
           selection? The latest styles?
               How do your company’s products and services enhance the customers’ lives?
           Do they make the customers’ lives easier? Are they a necessity? Do they make your
           customers feel good about themselves?
               When you know the answers to these questions, you will have a good idea
           about how to relate to your customers. Armed with this knowledge, you can be-
           gin to establish a rapport with your customers. Establishing a rapport is the first
           step of relationship building. You begin every relationship by laying building
           blocks on top of the basic foundation you learned in Chapter 1.
               Be friendly. No matter who your customers are, everyone appreciates some-
           one who is friendly. When you smile and offer a friendly greeting, you put your
           customers at ease. You show them, from the start, that you are a person who is
           approachable and willing to help.
               Be interested. The smile and greeting also show that you are interested.
           When you ask people how they are doing or ask how you can help, you are con-
           veying the message that you are interested. Being interested means listening when
           customers respond. Imagine how you would sound if you asked a customer how
           he was doing, he said, “I’m having the worst day of my life. Really awful,” and with
           no emotion you responded, “Oh.” Not very interested, right? The customer most
           likely would be wondering why you bothered to ask. Being interested means lis-
           tening and responding accordingly. Being interested means thinking of ways to
           brighten other people’s days.
                                                                                          79
                                                                                        JUMPING
   Be sensitive. When the customer said he was having the worst day of his life          IN WITH
                                                                                       BOTH FEET:
you could have said, “Oh my gosh. I’m sorry to hear that. What can I do to make
                                                                                      RELATIONSHIP
your day better?” Not only are you interested, you are sensitive to the customer’s      BUILDING
situation. Being sensitive means being empathetic and considerate of other
people’s situations. Even if you can not personally understand or relate to what
the customer is saying, you can be sensitive in your response.
    Be trustful. The best way to demonstrate that you can be trusted is by be-
ing honest and ethical in everything you do. When you always act with integrity,
your personality reflects your honesty. If you are friendly and helpful with a cus-
tomer and later make fun of him within earshot of other customers, you do not
come across as being a trustful person. Being trustful includes treating people
with dignity and respect.
    Find common ground. When you listen to your customer’s statements and
responses, try to find something you have in common. To the customer who is
having a bad day, you might respond, “I’m sorry to hear that. I had one of those
days yesterday. Nothing seemed to go right for me.” The customer will appreciate
that you can relate to having a bad day. Even if you did not have a bad day to
relate to, there are other ways to find common ground. Empathize with the cus-
tomer. Ask a question. Show interest. In other situations, you can relate by com-
plimenting the customer on something she is wearing, by saying something about
yourself, or even by talking about the weather.




HOW COULD SARAH HAVE ESTABLISHED RAPPORT WITH
HER CUSTOMER?

   “Be sure you say hi to the customers when they come in,” her manager says
   as she walks away.
       “I have a question,” Sarah stops her. “When I say hi to customers, am I
   supposed to ask if they need help or should I leave them alone?”
       “That’s a good question. Most of our customers come in to browse so
   we usually leave them alone. But I do want you to let them know you are
   here to help if they need anything. When a customer comes in, smile, look
   at her, and say something like, ‘Hi, how are you today? If you need any-
  80
CUSTOMER
 SERVICE      thing, I’ll be happy to help you find it.’ That way the customer knows we’re
TRAINING
              going to leave her alone to browse, but will be available to help.”

                  “OK.” Sarah busies herself folding tops on the front display table.
                  Beth Adams, meanwhile, is outside the store looking at the clothing
              display in the window. She comes into the store and notices Sarah.
                  This is Sarah’s first customer. She is nervous, but knows what she needs
              to do. She looks at Beth, smiles, and says, “Hi, how are you doing today?”
                  Beth smiles back. “I’m fine, thanks, how are you?”
                  “It’s my first day so I don’t know yet. I’m a little nervous.”
              “I know how that feels. I’m sure you’ll do just fine.”
              “If you need anything, I’ll be happy to help you find it.”
              “Thanks, I’m looking for a skirt. I’ll look around.”
              “OK. We have skirts in great summer colors.”
              Beth smiles and walks away.

           Even though Sarah felt awkward, she knew what she needed to do. She showed
           she was friendly by smiling and greeting Beth. She demonstrated she was inter-
           ested in Beth by listening and commenting on the skirts in great summer colors.
           When she told Beth it was her first day and she was nervous, Beth could relate to
           her feelings and they found common ground. Sarah established a rapport with
           Beth.

        nce you establish a rapport, continue building your relationships by in-
O       teracting with your customers in a positive manner. When you are posi-
tive and upbeat, people will respond likewise. It is hard to stay down with some-
one who is upbeat. What type of people do you like to be around? Those who
bring you up? Or those who drag you down? At work, be a person who brings
others up.
    Be helpful. Show your customers you care. Go the extra mile for them. Do
something to make other people feel good about themselves. Set a personal goal
to help someone every day. You will feel better when you meet that goal. It is a
great personal habit to get into.
    Be committed. When you commit yourself to your company and to your
customers, you will look for ways to make things better. No matter what you
do today, do your best. Give today and every day 110%. Give your customers
110%.
    Be a problem solver. Be part of the solution rather than part of the prob-
lem. Look for answers rather than focusing on what is wrong. When you adopt
a problem-solving approach you will find it hard to be negative. People who fo-
cus on problems complain; people who focus on solutions find ways to make a
difference.
    Be credible. This means being knowledgeable about your products and your
company. Customers appreciate nice employees, but they value knowledgeable
employees. Learn as much as you can about your product line. If you need addi-
tional technical training, ask your manager for it.
    Believe in your products. No matter what your company manufactures or
sells, whether it is life insurance or clothing, you need to believe in your prod-
ucts. Otherwise you will never come across sincerely. Sincerity is borne out of
believing in what you do. Believing that your products will help your customers
is crucial to doing the right thing for them. It does not matter what line of work
you are in, when you truly believe that your company’s products can help your
customers, you will promote your products, your company, and yourself in a
positive and sincere manner.

           HOW COULD SARAH HAVE INTERACTED POSITIVELY WITH BETH?

              Sarah continues to fold the tops while Beth browses.
                  “Excuse me, can you see if you have this skirt in a size twelve?” Beth
              asks.
                  Sarah takes the skirt from Beth and says, “Yes, I’ll be happy to. This is
              a great skirt, and I love this shade of green.”
                  “I love it too. I hope you have it, I could use a green skirt.”
                  “I’ll be right back.”
                  Sarah hurries into the stock room. She comes back with a different
              style green skirt and says, “I’m sorry, we don’t have that skirt in your size.
              I don’t know if you saw this one. I brought it because you mentioned you
              wanted a green skirt.”
                  “Thanks, but that isn’t exactly what I was looking for.”

           Sarah was helpful. She demonstrated she was solution oriented by bringing a
           different green skirt. She showed she believed in her products by saying that Beth
           made a great choice.

      STEP 3:    Identifying Customers’ Needs                                             IN WITH
                                                                                        BOTH FEET:
                                                                                       RELATIONSHIP

       ustomers come into your business for a reason. Sometimes they are not very
C      clear about their needs. Beth was specific when she mentioned she needed
a green skirt. This helped Sarah come up with an alternative option. If Beth had
not mentioned a green skirt, Sarah would not have known her needs. While this
is a simplistic example, the principle is the same, whether you sell clothing or
computer systems. When you deal with customers, your job is to uncover their
needs.
    Ask questions. In Chapter 2 you learned about open and closed questions.
When customers do not know how to tell you what they need, it is your job to
figure out what they need. Sometimes customers are not even sure they know
what they need. Use open questions to get the customer talking. Remember,
questions that begin with what, why, and how encourage customers to talk. Use
closed questions to clarify an answer. Closed questions begin with who, would,
how, and where. A question beginning with how can be either open or closed:
Open, How do you think you would use this? Closed, How many times a week will
you use it?
    Summarize customers’ needs. After you have asked enough questions to
determine your customer’s needs, summarize your understanding of what the
customer has told you. For example, “From what I understand, your son has
allergies, and you are looking for a vacuum cleaner that will remove the greatest
number allergens and is the least costly” or “You mentioned that you got your bill,
and you were overcharged for. . . .” If your understanding is incorrect, ask more
open and closed questions until you get it right.
    Recommend appropriate solutions. When you ask enough questions, you
get enough information to recommend the best solution. If your job is to sell
products, you can make an appropriate proposal. If you handle billing issues and
miscellaneous problems, you can find a workable solution. Make sure that your
recommendations are based on what the customer told you. Refer to things the
customer said when making your recommendation. “This is our most economic
vacuum, and it will remove 99% of all allergens. With your son’s allergies, you want
to make sure your vacuum picks up as many of allergen particles as possible.”
    Handle objections. Follow the steps you learned in Chapter 2. Listen to the
customer’s objection. Acknowledge it. Follow up with a question. Consider the
  84
CUSTOMER
 SERVICE   customer’s answer. Following up on the vacuum cleaner sale, the customer says
TRAINING
           “Thanks, I’ll think about it.” You respond, “What questions do you have about this
   101
           one?” “None, but it’s more than I wanted to spend.” “I can understand that, but this
           product is the most efficient for removing allergens. We do have cheaper models that
           I can show you, but none of them work as well as this one.” Answer the customer’s
           silent question, What is this going to do for me? When you can answer this ques-
           tion, you will be better able to get past the customer’s objections.




           HOW COULD SARAH HAVE USED QUESTIONING TECHNIQUES TO
           UNCOVER BETH’S NEEDS?

              “Thanks, but that isn’t exactly what I was looking for.”
                 “What type of skirt are you interested in?”
                 “I prefer longer skirts.”
                 “What other colors would you be interested in?”
                 “I really could use green. I suppose I could use a khaki one, too.”
                 “Do you like prints?”
                 “No, I only wear solids.”
                 “OK, a longer skirt in a solid green or khaki. Why don’t I check in the
              back to see if we have any?”
                 “Would you? That would be great.”

           Sarah asked the customer questions to determine exactly what she was looking
           for, then she recapped what the customer said to make sure she understood. Once
           she was clear, she made a recommendation to look for another style of skirt.

  STEP 4:     Making the Customer Feel Valued                                                IN WITH
                                                                                           BOTH FEET:
                                                                                          RELATIONSHIP
                                                                                            BUILDING
           hen you establish a rapport, interact positively, identify customer needs
W          to make a valid recommendation, and make customers feel valued, you
are on your way to building strong relationships. Whether your interaction is a
one-time conversation or an ongoing interaction with a customer who does re-
peat business with your company, your primary job is to communicate effectively
and build positive relationships.
    Go out of your way for your customers. Do what you can to help them. Try
to give them more than they asked for. When a customer asks a question, give a
thorough explanation rather than a one word answer. Your customers will know
when you go out of your way for them. Sarah could have easily let Beth walk out
the door when she could not find the skirt she wanted. By going out of her way,
she not only made Beth feel valued, she also had the possibility of making a sale.
    Validate customers’ decisions. Even if you do not agree with customers’
choices, always validate their decisions. If the vacuum salesperson was not able
to make the sale, he could validate the customer’s decision by saying, “I under-
stand how you feel. This brand is costly.” How would Beth feel if Sarah said, “You
want green? Green is such a drab color. Why not go for a bright color like pink?”
Sarah validated Beth’s decision to buy a green skirt by saying that was a great
color. When she could not find that particular skirt in green she asked Beth what
she was interested in. This also validated Beth’s feelings.
    Instill positive feelings. Never make customers feel bad about their decisions.
Think how the mother would feel if the salesperson said, “I guess your son will
have to deal with the allergens in your house.” Rather, he could say, “It’s a big deci-
sion. I’ll be happy to help you if you have any more questions about it.”




HOW COULD SARAH MAKE BETH FEEL VALUED?

   Sarah returns with a skirt. “I found this khaki skirt. How do you like it?”
       After looking it over, Beth says, “Thanks for looking, but I still like the
   style of the green one better.”
  86

 SERVICE          “I understand and I appreciate that you really liked that skirt. I’m sorry

           Sarah went out of her way to find another skirt, but when Beth said it was not
           what she was looking for, Sarah validated Beth’s decision by saying she under-
           stood. She instilled positive feelings by assuring Beth that she appreciated her
           decision. She had no other styles to show Beth so that was as far as she went.

       nce you build strong relationships with customers, your work is not done.
O      In any relationship, whether business or personal, you have to work to
maintain the relationship. Customers come back a second time because you
established a relationship with them. Imagine how valued they will feel if you
remember them? Because Sarah went out of her way to help Beth, Beth is likely
to return. That is the way to build customer loyalty. But, if Beth goes back and
Sarah does not remember her, Beth will not be as likely to maintain a business
relationship.
     Remember your customers. Nothing makes a customer feel more valued
than being remembered. Remember your repeat customers and acknowledge
them. Customers who do repeat business with a company appreciate being rec-
ognized. When customers are treated as though they are invisible, they might just
become invisible.
     Learn customers’ names. When customers come into your business re-
peatedly, make it a point to learn their names. People love hearing their names,
especially when they come into a business. Addressing a customer by name will
let her know she is important to you. If you do not know the customer well, use
the last name. “Hi Mrs. Adams, how are you today?” Leave it up to Mrs. Adams to
tell you whether you should call her by her first name.
     Remember something about your customers. Remember the customer
who was having the worst day? Think how he would feel if next time you said,
“Hi, how are you doing today? I hope you’re having a better day than the last time
you were in.” Everyone appreciates an employee with a good memory. This shows
your customers that you value your relationship with them.
     Learn your customers’ preferences. If you deal with the same customers
repeatedly, get to know what they like. If you have too many customers to re-
member each one’s tastes, you could start a card file or a computer file and note
your repeat customers’ preferences and other information you might want to
remember about them. Next time they come in, try to incorporate their pref-
erences into your conversation. Your customers will be impressed that you
remembered.

   101               Try to do something special every now and then for your repeat cus-

           and showing new products that might interest them or asking if they would like a
           cup of coffee. Show your repeat customers that you appreciate them.




           HOW COULD SARAH MAINTAIN AN ONGOING RELATIONSHIP
           WITH HER CUSTOMERS?

              The following week, Sarah spots Beth in the store. She walks over to her.
              “Hi. You know I thought of you the other day.”
                 “You did?”
                 “I sure did. We got some new green skirts in, and I was hoping I’d see
              you. We still have some in stock. Would you like me to show them to you?”
                 “Yes! I can’t believe you remembered.”

           Not only did Sarah remember Beth, she remembered that Beth was looking for
           a green skirt. Next time Beth needs clothes, where do you think she will go? Sarah
           built a relationship with Beth and now she is working to maintain it.

       ost of your customers will be average people with average needs. Most of
M      your customers will be pleasant people who appreciate your help. Some
customers, though, will test your skills and, at times, your patience.
    Besides the average, everyday people with whom you regularly interact, here
are some other customer “types” and tips on how to interact positively with
them.
    The pushy, obnoxious customer—remain calm. Maintain a professional
demeanor. Smile. Try to put the customer at ease. Speak softly and control your
voice inflection. Never take on the same tone this type of customer uses with you.
Speak in a positive, upbeat tone of voice. When you stay calm, you stay in con-
trol. When you stay in control, you will be able to help this type of customer
without coming unglued. Remember, pushy, obnoxious customers are not like
this only with you. This is part of their personalities and perhaps being pushy is
the only way they know how to act. In other words, do not take their behavior
personally.
    The timid, indecisive customer—be patient. Help draw these customers
out and get them to talk more. Ask open ended questions. Listen closely to their
responses and try to guide them to give you enough information to help them
reach a decision. Some people have a difficult time reaching any decision. Some
people are naturally shy. Be sensitive to timid, indecisive customers and help
them become more talkative by asking questions and encouraging them to talk.
    The overly friendly, flirty customer—be professional. Keep your end of
the conversation on business. These customers can be difficult to handle because
they do not see their behavior as being out of line. It is up to you to control the
conversation. Do not foster overly friendly or flirty behavior by being overly
friendly in return. Guide your conversation back to business. If a flirty cus-
tomer continues, give a gentle reminder that you want to help—with a business
solution.
    The culturally different customer—be tolerant. We live in a society made
up of many cultures, languages, and customs, yet, people often do not know how
to talk or act in the presence of a person from another culture. Kindness, a smile,
honesty, and empathy translate into any language and across any barrier. People
  90
CUSTOMER
 SERVICE   who do not look like us or act like we do can make us uncomfortable. By learn-
TRAINING
           ing to be tolerant of differences, you will overcome any cultural obstacles.
   101
               A special note on people with disabilities—be respectful. People with dis-
           abilities want to be treated like everyone else. Make eye contact and speak in your
           normal tone and pace of speech. Once you get used to dealing with people with
           disabilities, you will see that they want to be treated like anyone else, with dignity
           and respect.



                      When interacting with people with disabilities, focus on the person first
                      and the disability second. Putting the disability first, such as saying “the
           handicapped person”, places the focus on the disability rather than on the person.
           When referring to a person with a disability, use terms such as “the man who uses
           a wheelchair”, “the woman who is blind”, or “the person with epilepsy”. Terms such as
           crippled, retarded, deformed, lame, or crazy are considered unacceptable, so drop
           these and other terms with negative connotations from your vocabulary. If you do
           not know how to refer to a person, use the term “person with a disability”.




           Other tips for interacting with people with disabilities:

           ➔ Offer to shake hands if this is normally how you greet people. It is accept-
             able to shake a person’s left hand. If, after offering your hand, you find the
             person is unable to shake hands, complete the handshake by placing your
             hand on the person’s right hand.

           ➔ Always ask first if a person wants help.

           ➔ If you don’t know what to do to help a person, ask what you should do.


           For People Who Use Wheelchairs:

           ➔ Try to place yourself at the person’s eye level.

           ➔ Never lean on a wheelchair or hover over the person.

           ➔ Make eye contact and speak directly to the person, not to the person’s
             companion.

➔ Speak clearly and use short, easy to understand words.                                RELATIONSHIP
                                                                                          BUILDING
➔ If the person has difficulty writing, offer to help complete paperwork.

➔ Give the person ample time to formulate thoughts and respond to you.

➔ Refrain from finishing the person’s sentence.

For People with Visual Impairments:

➔ Never touch a service dog without first asking permission.

➔ Tell the person about any obstacles in his or her path. “There are boxes in
  the aisle ahead, so we’ll walk on the left side.”

➔ When asking the person to take a seat, help him or her touch the chair
  first.

➔ Verbalize what you are doing to help the person. “I’m inputting the infor-
  mation into my computer so I can give you an installation date.”

For People with Hearing Impairments:

➔ Look at the person and speak and enunciate clearly.

➔ Use simple words and short sentences.

For People with Speech Impairments:

➔ Ask the person to repeat if you do not understand, then repeat his/her
  words back to be sure you understood correctly.

➔ Use closed questions that require short answers.

In all cases, when interacting with people with disabilities, be patient. Also, don’t
be embarrassed or overly apologetic if you make a blunder.
    When you learn to interact with different types of people and personalities,
you will confidently handle any customer in any situation. By building and main-
taining positive relationships, you are on your way to providing great customer
service.

                This is Sarah’s first customer. She is nervous but knows what she
           needs to do. She looks at Beth, smiles, and says, “Hi, how are you do-
           ing today?”
                Beth smiles back. “I’m fine, thanks, how are you?”
                “It’s my first day so I don’t know yet. I’m a little nervous.”
           “I know how that feels. I’m sure you’ll do just fine.”
           “If you need anything, I’ll be happy to help you find it.”
           “Thanks, I’m looking for a skirt. I’ll look around.”
           “OK. We have skirts in great summer colors.”
           Beth smiles and walks away.
                Sarah continues to fold the tops while Beth browses.
                “Excuse me, can you see if you have this skirt in a size twelve?”
           Beth asks.
                Sarah takes the skirt from Beth and says, “Yes, I’ll be happy to.This
           is a great skirt and I love this shade of green.”
                “I love it too. I hope you have it, I could use a green skirt.”
                “I’ll be right back.”
                Sarah hurries into the stock room. She comes back with a differ-
           ent style green skirt and says, “I’m sorry, we don’t have that skirt in
           your size. I don’t know if you saw this one. I brought it because you
           mentioned you wanted a green skirt.”
                “Thanks, but that isn’t exactly what I was looking for.”
                “What type of skirt are you interested in?”
                “I prefer longer skirts.”
                “What other colors would you be interested in?”
                “I really could use green. I suppose I could use a khaki one, too.”
                “Do you like prints?”
                “No, I only wear solids.”
                “OK, a longer skirt in a solid green or khaki. Why don’t I check
           in the back to see if we have any?”
                “Would you? That would be great.”
                                                                                         93

           Sarah returns with a skirt. “I found this khaki skirt. How do you            IN WITH
                                                                                      BOTH FEET:
       like it?”
                                                                                     RELATIONSHIP
           After looking it over, Beth says, “Thanks for looking, but I still like     BUILDING
       the style of the green one better.”
           “I understand and I appreciate that you really liked that skirt. I’m
       sorry I couldn’t help you find something.”
           The following week, Sarah spots Beth in the store. She walks over
       to her. “Hi. You know I thought of you the other day.”
           “You did?”
           “I sure did. We got some new green skirts in, and I was hoping I’d
       see you. We still have some in stock. Would you like me to show
       them to you?”
           “Yes! I can’t believe you remembered.”

Have you ever blown a relationship because you did not work to maintain it?

Every day Kevin went out to lunch.
    Every day he went to the same restaurant.
    He sat at the same table and was waited on by the same waitress.
    Every day the waitress asked him the same question.
    “Hi, what can I get you today?”
    Every day he gave the same reply.
    “I’ll have the special.”
    One day, his friend invited him to lunch at a new restaurant in town. Kevin
went. When they walked into the restaurant, the manager greeted them. “Hi,
welcome to the Downtown Diner. Have a seat anywhere you’d like.”
    They sat, and a waitress came to their table.“Hi guys, how are you doing?” She
was cheerful and made them feel comfortable. “What can I get you today?”
    “I’ll have the special,” Kevin said.
    “I had that for my lunch, and it’s great,” she smiled.
    Kevin enjoyed his lunch so much he decided to go back the following day. On
his third day back, the waitress said, “Hi, it’s nice to see you again. The special,
right?”
    Kevin laughed and nodded. “Hey, ordering the special takes the guesswork
out of things. One less decision to make is a good thing.”
    Kevin was impressed that she not only remembered him, she remembered
what he ordered. He thought about the other restaurant. I went there every day,
and they acted like they didn’t know me. I’ve been here three times, and the waitress
not only remembers me, she remembers what I order.
    That diner had a new regular. Because this waitress cared enough about Kevin
to remember his preference, she made him feel valued as a customer. To Kevin,
that was important.

CUSTOMER
 SERVICE       Giving exceptional customer service when dealing with customers in person
TRAINING
           seems pretty simple on face value. Why, then, do so many of our interactions with
   101
           customer service employees leave us feeling empty, or worse yet, invisible?
               Customers have been conditioned not to expect much.
           When you treat customers as though they are important guests
           you invited into your business, they will feel valued. When you
           treat customers as though they matter to you, they will feel
           appreciated.
               You already learned that creating a positive first impression will help you
           build the foundation for providing great customer service. Customers are going
           to judge you by your initial look, manner, and actions. Did you know that cus-
           tomers also get a first impression of your overall business when they come in? In
           addition to forming a first impression of you, your customers also judge your
           company by its look, image, and overall atmosphere.
                    Put your customer hat back on. Think about some businesses you went
                       into recently. What was your first impression of them? Did you no-
                             tice that some of them seemed to invite you inside with their
                              warmth, while others felt so chilly you could not wait to leave?
               Customers judge a business in its entirety. Their assessment, particularly
           when forming that crucial first impression, includes how you look and act, how
           your business looks and feels, and how well you interact with them. Customers
           may come to your business because of a product or service, but they will decide
           to stay or leave based on an overall feeling of warmth or coolness. The difference
           between the two can bring them back or keep them away.

              Think about the businesses you recently walked into that made you feel wel-
              come. What did the employees do that made you feel welcome? What aspects
              of the appearance of the business made you feel welcome?

Remember that a customer’s first impression is based on both the employees and
the overall atmosphere of the company. A company can have a messy appearance
and great employees. Likewise, a company may have a great appearance and em-
ployees with terrible attitudes. Apply the principles you learned in Part I, and you
will help your customers form a favorable first impression.

                                                   THIS

       Dave Benjamin has an appointment for a physical examination. He
       arrives at the physician’s office, feeling slightly uneasy because it is
       his first appointment with this doctor. He walks into the office, looks
       around at bland beige walls, a row of uncomfortable looking chairs,
       a table with ripped magazines strewn about, and drab brown carpet-
       ing.Two other people are waiting. He eyes a sliding glass window with
       a note taped on it: Sign in, and we’ll call you when we’re ready for you.
       He signs his name on the pad and takes a seat. Someone on the other
       side of the window slides it open, looks at his name, and quickly shuts
       the window without saying a word. He sits, anxiously waiting and
       wondering when his name will be called.
           The window slides open again. “Mr. Benjamin?”
           Dave springs up and walks quickly to the window.
           “You need to fill out this form since you haven’t been here be-
       fore,” a woman says, no expression in her voice. “When you’re done,
       ring the bell.”
           Dave takes the paper, fills it out, rings the bell, and sits back down.
       The woman slides the window open, takes the paper, and shuts the
       window without saying a word.
           After the other two people are called, Dave waits for what seems
       an eternity. A nurse finally calls his name. “Mr. Benjamin?” He stands
  106

           What Went Wrong?

           Dave was always uncomfortable in a doctor’s office. Being in this doctor’s office
           did nothing to ease his discomfort. No one made him feel welcome.

              How Did the Customer Feel?

              How do you think the employees made Dave feel by the way they treated
              him?

           When you interact with customers face to face, presenting a positive business
           personality means a lot. In other words, it is the complete package that counts.
           Drab brown carpeting, bland beige walls, ripped magazines, and employees be-
           hind a glass wall say a lot about a business’ personality. Imagine instead, if Dave
           opened the door and saw a warm color scheme, an interesting mix of furniture
           that looked comfortable and inviting, neatly arranged magazines, and an employee
           who greeted him.

           walking through the front door. Take a good look at what your customers see
           when they come into your business.

Doing the Walk Through

When you do your mental walk through, pretend you are seeing your business
for the first time. Look at the colors, decorations, cleanliness, and neatness. How
does your business look? Do you have an interesting focal point for your cus-
tomers to see when they come in? How easy is it to move about? How accessible
are your display areas? Is there a sensible traffic flow pattern? Is the lighting
sufficient? Is everything clean, including bathrooms? Pay close attention to all
details—your customers will.




What Can You Do to Improve the Look of Your Business?

As a group, try to come up with ideas to improve the overall look and image of
your business. Think about color, function, and feel. Here are some things to pay
attention to:

➔ Try to create a focal point for customers when they enter your business,
  such as an interesting piece of furniture, a piece of artwork, or an interest-
  ing display case. Create something that is memorable.

➔ Decorate your business in a style that suits the image you are trying to
  project. Knowing who your customers are is important when creating the
  appropriate look and feel for your business.

➔ Pay close attention to cleanliness and organization. Even if your business is
  decorated to suit your customers, it will not hold their attention if they
  first see clutter or a dirty appearance.

Now that you focused on your company’s image, focus on your own. What image
do you present to your customers when they walk into your business? Think about
everything you learned in Chapters 1, 2, and 3. Think about the total package you
  108

 SERVICE   present: your courtesies, attitude, appearance, manner of speak-
TRAINING
           ing, body language, listening skills, interaction, and overall

           interest.
               Giving exceptional face-to-face customer service begins when
           you greet your customers. From the moment a customer walks into
           your business to the moment the customer leaves your business, you
           must take specific steps to make that customer feel important and valued.
               Learn the following and you will be on your way to providing exceptional
           face-to-face customer service.

                  STEP 1: Saying Hello: Greeting the Customer
                  STEP 2: Between Hello and Goodbye: Helping the Customer
                  STEP 3: Saying Goodbye: Ending the Interaction

           In Dave’s situation, his discomfort would have been eased if he walked into an
           interesting, warm, and organized waiting room. He would have felt much better
           if the receptionist talked to him. When the nurse came for him, she could have
           smiled and made small talk to make him feel comfortable.

           In answer to the questions, you may have written something like:

              How do you think the employees made Dave feel by the way they treated him?
                 The employees did nothing to make him feel comfortable. Not saying hello
              and not talking to him about filling out the form probably made him feel even
              more uncomfortable. When the nurse came for him, she did nothing to put
              him at ease.

              What do you think Dave’s first impressions of the doctor’s office were?
                 When he first came in and saw the drab appearance of the office, his first
              impression was not good. The doctor and the employees did not seem to care
              how the waiting room looked. The way the employees treated him did nothing
              to make him feel comfortable. He did not form a good first impression.

                                                                                         FACE-TO-FACE

                  Greeting the Customer                                                   CONTACTS



     ou learned in Chapter 1 how to make a good overall first impression, but
Y    there will be occasions when, no matter how hard you try, you do not make
a good first impression. You might remind a customer of her old boyfriend. You
might remind a customer of his rude neighbor. A customer might not like the
way you look for no rational reason. When this happens, your first words will go
a long way to start building your customer service foundation.
    Greet every customer. A quick smile, an interested look, and a friendly
greeting will show your customers that you are genuinely happy they came in to
your business. Remember Kris in the gift shop? What a difference she and her
coworkers made in the Final Take when they were interested in helping their
customers. A friendly greeting will help overcome any negative vibes customers
may have as they are forming their first impressions.
    Make an impressionable opening statement. What you say is important
in presenting yourself well to your customers. When you greet your customers,
say more than hello. Add something to let them know you are happy they chose
your business. Try something like: “Hi, welcome to Karen’s Bakery,” or “Hi, we’re
glad you came in.” When you say more than hello, your customers know you are
interested in them and you appreciate that they chose your business. If you
remember the customers from a previous visit, acknowledge them differently.
Address them by name if you know it. “It’s great to see you again.” “Hi Juanita,
how are you doing today?”
    Ask, or say how you can provide help and give your name. After greeting
your customers and making an impressionable opening statement , ask how you
can help. Even if, like Sarah, your customers come in to browse, let them know
you are there to help. You might say, “Are you looking for anything particular to-
day?” or “My name is Sarah, and I’ll be happy to help you in any way.” In the
doctor’s office, the receptionist could have assured Dave she would help if he had
any questions about the form. Since this was his first visit, talking to him would
have helped put him at ease. “Since this is your first visit with us, I’ll need you to
complete this patient information form. My name is Kathy and if you have any
questions I’ll be glad to answer them.”

           quickly and easily they smile back. Pick up on their attitudes. When you are
           interested in your customers, you will be able to pick up on their moods, and they
           will notice your interest. It was probably fairly evident that Dave was uncom-
           fortable. “Thank you for completing the form. You can have a seat, and the nurse
           will come for you. It shouldn’t take long. We’ll get you in as soon as possible.”




           HOW COULD THE PHYSICIAN’S OFFICE STAFF GREET DAVE
           MORE POSITIVELY?

              Dave Benjamin arrives at the physician’s office, feeling slightly uneasy be-
              cause it is his first appointment with this doctor. He walks into the office,
              looks around at warm gold walls, an interesting grouping of chairs, a table
              with magazines neatly organized, and an Oriental rug covering the wood
              floors.
                  He sees an open sliding glass window. A cheerful woman smiles and
              greets him. “Good morning, how are you today?”
                  “I’m fine, thank you. I’m Dave Benjamin. I have an appointment with
              Dr. Gilbert.”
                  “Thank you. Mr. Benjamin, since this is your first time seeing Dr.
              Gilbert, will you please complete this new patient information form?”
              She reviews the form with Dave. “When you complete it, you can bring it
              back to me. My name is Kathy, and if you have any questions I’ll be happy
              to help you.” Sensing his discomfort, she smiles warmly.
                  Dave smiles back, completes the form, and returns it to Kathy.
                  She quickly looks it over. “Thanks Mr. Benjamin. Have a seat, and Dr.
              Gilbert’s nurse will call you. It shouldn’t take long.”

           When Kathy warmly greeted Dave, she gave him her full attention. She projected
           a confident, caring attitude that made Dave feel she was interested in him. Tuning
           in to his feelings, Kathy sensed he felt uneasy so she made it a point of offering to
           help him in any way she could and assuring him he would not have to wait long.

      STEP 2:      Between Hello and Goodbye:                                                EYE TO EYE:
                                                                                            FACE-TO-FACE

       fter greeting your customers, it is time to get to the nuts and bolts of help-
A      ing them. They came to you for a reason. Finding out that reason and find-
ing the best solution is your next step in helping your customers.
    Pay attention to that one customer. And only that one customer. Show
you are interested in helping by listening actively and making eye contact with
the customer you are helping. Remember the employee at the deli? When he was
helping Steve, he kept looking at the door whenever someone came in. Never do
that when you are helping a customer. Looking at other people sends a clear
message that those other people are more important than your customer.
    Show and tell. When a customer asks where something is located, show the
customer rather than pointing at or telling where it is. Walk the customer to that
area of the store. If it is a small item, pick it up and hand it to the customer. If a
customer asks about a product, tell him about it. Give a good description. Use
your show-and-tell time to talk to the customer.
    Make the most of your question and answer period. Refer back to Chap-
ter 2, Step 4 and Chapter 3, Step 3. If the customer asks for a specific item,
show the item to the customer and then ask questions to make sure it is the best
solution. Use a combination of open and closed questions to learn more about
what the customer needs. Make a recommendation based on what the customer
tells you.
    Know when to stay and when to go. Pick up on your customer’s cues
whether he wants you to stay and help or whether he wants to be left alone.
Sometimes people come in to browse, or perhaps they are unsure what solution
they are looking for. Do not be overbearing with customers. If they want time
to look around, say, “I’ll be right here if I can help you,” or “I’ll be happy to help if
you need anything.”



          If a phone call comes in while you are helping a customer, ask the caller
          to hold while you finish or offer to call back. Never make the customer,
who is ready to do business, wait while you take a call.

           HOW COULD DAVE’S VISIT TO THE DOCTOR HAVE GONE BETTER?

              Soon a nurse comes into the waiting room.“Mr. Benjamin?”Dave stands and
              walks toward her. She smiles warmly.“My name is Ann. How are you doing?”
                 “I’m fine, thanks.”
                 “Great. Come with me, I’ll get you weighed and take your blood pres-
              sure first. Then Dr. Gilbert will see you.”

           By the time Ann came for him, Dave felt comfortable being in Dr. Gilbert’s office.
           Both Kathy and Ann explained the procedures to Dave. Because Dave was com-
           fortable with the employees, with the look of the office, and with the organized
           manner in which it was run, Dave felt he was in good hands.




           What Steps Should You Take to Help Customers?

           Discuss the steps you should take to help your customers. For example, in Dr.
           Gilbert’s office, the employees are expected to make patients feel comfortable
           by being friendly and explaining every procedure. Review a typical customer
           interaction step by step. What, specifically, should you do to help your typical
           customer? It is important for you to know what you are expected to do to help
           your customers. Now you can give each customer the same level of service.

       ustomers are going to remember their visit to your company. Whether
C      customers do business with you or not, why not make their visit memorable
by making them feel valued?
    Find the right solution. When you find the right solution for your customers,
they will feel good about coming to you for help. Sometimes you will not have
the best solution to offer, but even when you are not able to give them what they
need, they will know that you tried your best.
    Make sure the customer is satisfied. When you ask the correct questions
and answer the questions correctly, when you identify the customer’s needs, and
when you find the best solution, go one step further to make sure the customer
is satisfied with the solution. Say something like, “I’m sure you’ll be happy with
that choice. It’s one of our most popular items”, “Do you have any questions about
how this works?”, or “I’m sorry we didn’t have that doodah you were looking for.”
Ask if you can help with anything else: “Did you find everything you were looking
for?”, “Is there anything else I can help you find today?”, or “Do you need batteries
for this toy?”
    Thank customers for coming in to your business. Always let your cus-
tomers know that you appreciate their business. If they do business with you say
something such as, “Enjoy your new. . . .” or “I’m glad I could resolve your billing
problem.” If the customer does not do business with you say, “Thanks for coming
in,” or “Thanks. Next time I hope we have what you’re looking for.” Let your cus-
tomers know you hope to see them again: “Please come back soon.”




HOW COULD THE STAFF AT DR. GILBERT’S OFFICE HAVE ENDED
DAVE’S VISIT ON A POSITIVE NOTE?

   Dr. Gilbert is finishing Dave’s physical.“Mr. Benjamin, it looks like you are
   taking great care of yourself. Do you have any questions?”
       “I can’t think of any.”
  114
CUSTOMER
 SERVICE         “All right. After you finish dressing, you can go to the reception area,

              you in a year. It was great meeting you.” Dr. Gilbert smiles, shakes Dave’s
              hand and says goodbye.
                 Kathy sees him coming. “Done already? I have your paperwork right
              here. Do you have any questions?”
                 “No, Dr. Gilbert was great. She spent a lot of time with me. I’m glad I
              came to see her.”
                 “That’s nice to hear. Would you like us to mail you a reminder card for
              your next appointment?”
                 “No, that’s OK. I’ll remember to call.”
                 “We do get booked up quickly, so try to call about two months prior
              so we can get you a convenient appointment.”
                 “Thanks for letting me know. I’ll make sure I do that.”
                 “Thank you for coming in and have a great day.”

           Kathy ended Dave’s visit by asking if he had any questions. His answer told her
           he was satisfied with his interaction with Dr. Gilbert. She ended by thanking him
           for coming in.

              The following week one of Dave’s coworkers asked if anyone knew of a
              good doctor.
                  “I do. I just saw Dr. Gilbert last week for a physical. She was great. Be-
              sides that, the office is clean, the staff is very friendly, and they went out of
              their way to make me feel comfortable. I’d definitely recommend her.”

           Had Dave’s visit ended with the Take One contact, chances are he would not be
           so quick to recommend Dr. Gilbert’s office to his coworker.



                     Whenever you have your customer hat on and go into a business, pay
                     close attention to the way you are treated. Think about the things you
           liked and the things you did not like. Learn from watching others. Make sure you
           treat customers the way you like to be treated.

                     “That’s nice to hear. Would you like us to mail you a reminder
                 card for your next appointment?”
                 “No, that’s OK. I’ll remember to call.”
                     “We do get booked up quickly, so try to call about two months
                 prior so we can get you a convenient appointment.”
                     “Thanks for letting me know. I’ll make sure I do that.”
                     “Great. Thanks for coming in and have a great day.”

           Although you may not automatically think of a physician’s office as a customer
           service provider, think again. Every business provides customer service. It is
           important that anyone—in any business—who interacts with customers under-
           stands this. Customers, even patients, will go to someone else if they are not
           satisfied with their treatment.

Have you ever made customers feel uncomfortable being in your business?

Andrew recently moved and needed to open a new bank account. Three banks
were in the area so he picked one at random. Walking in, he was greeted by gray:
gray walls and gray carpet. Even the employees’ personalities seemed to match
the color scheme. No one looked at him. No one smiled.
    Andrew sat down in a gray chair and waited for one of the account repre-
sentatives to help him. As he waited, his discomfort grew. He looked around
and thought, I feel like I’m inside a battleship. What’s up with the gray? And what’s
up with the employees? Everyone acts like they’re robots. Continuing to wait, he
thought, Maybe I’m invisible. I know they’re all helping other people, but no one’s
even looked at me.
    Andrew left. He did not feel comfortable being there so he drove to another
bank. He walked in, and one of the tellers greeted him: “Hello. Welcome to First
Bank.” Andrew explained to the teller he needed to open an account. The teller
replied, “Everyone in new accounts is busy right now. Please have a seat, and
someone will be with you shortly.”
    Andrew sat down in a comfortable chair and waited for an account represen-
tative. As he looked around, he noticed the bank was decorated tastefully, and he
felt at ease. As he watched the employees, he saw that everyone seemed happy
to be working at First Bank. Every time a customer came in, either one of the em-
ployees or the manager greeted the customer.
    After opening his new account, Andrew stopped at the manager’s desk and
said, “Excuse me, I just want to tell you how nice it is to be in a place where the
employees really seem to care about the customers.”
    The manager smiled, “Thank you for sharing that. Our policy is to make sure
all our customers know that they are important to us. Every time you come in
you can expect to be treated the same way.”
    Even with the dull gray color scheme and lackluster appearance, the employ-
ees at the other bank could have changed Andrew’s poor first impression by
being friendly and showing him that they valued his business. Had someone—
anyone—greeted him and made him feel welcome, he would not have left.

CUSTOMER
 SERVICE       Conducting business by telephone requires a different
TRAINING
           skill set than dealing with people face to face. Listening be-
   101
           comes even more important when you cannot see your
           customers. If you fail to listen, it is impossible to pick up
           on the nonverbal cues you get when you can see the other
           person.
               When customers cannot see you, what you say, how you say it, and what you
           do not say are equally important. It is important to verbalize what you are do-
           ing. Silence, to a customer, can mean different things: Are you still there? or
           What are you doing? Answer your customers’ silent questions before they ask
           them. “I’m reading through the notes on my computer screen. It’ll be just a mo-
           ment.” Now the customer knows you are still there and you are working on the
           problem.
               Maintaining a professional and friendly telephone demeanor, keeping an
           ongoing dialogue, asking appropriate questions, and responding appropriately
           to your customers are important skills to have when you interact with customers
           by phone.

                 Diane Parker likes the convenience of shopping by catalog. She some-
                 times orders over the Internet, but prefers calling because she likes
                 interacting with a person. Ashley works in a catalog call center, where
                 her job is to take orders from customers. She answers the following
                 call from Diane:
                     “VeeJay’s Sportswear.”
                     “Hi, I’d like to place a catalog order.”
                     “May I have your name and billing address?”
                     “Yes, Diane Parker. My address is 23 Sycamore Road. . . .”
                     “Is that the address to which you want your order shipped?”
                     “Yes.”
                     “What is your first catalog number?”
                     “14236.”
                     “Size?”
                                                                                        123
                                                                                       SAYING IT
           “Medium.”                                                                    WITH A

           “Rose.”                                                                    CONTACTS
           “Next item?”
           Diane continues to give her list of items, along with her credit card
       information.There is silence on the other end of the line. Diane waits.
       And waits. She begins to wonder what is happening. Has the em-
       ployee put her on hold? Forgotten about her? Taken a break? “Hello,”
       she says into the silence.
           “I’m here,” comes a bland reply. “I’m waiting for your order to
       process. It shouldn’t be long.”
           Diane waits again.
           “Your order has gone through. All items are in stock and will be
       shipped out tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with?”
           “No thanks.”
           “Thank you for calling.”
           Diane hangs up, hoping the employee got all the items correct.


What Went Wrong?

Ashley was efficient in taking Diane’s order. She most likely followed her com-
pany’s expectations for handling catalog orders. But it sounded as though Diane
was giving her order to an automated system. Ashley added nothing to her con-
tact with Diane. Sophisticated call answering equipment could have taken the
order just as well. While Ashley may have been efficient in taking the order, she
left out the important detail of putting a personal touch into the contact. Putting
a personal touch into your phone conversations will make you, as well as your
company, come alive through the telephone.

CUSTOMER
 SERVICE   You already learned the importance of conveying a positive attitude through your
TRAINING
           body language and appearance when you deal with a customer in a face-to-face
   101
           situation.
               When you deal with customers on the telephone, your verbal communica-
           tion skills, particularly your tone, are important. Your customers will “see” you
           through your voice, because they cannot see you through your appearance. Your
           attitude will come through the phone line, so whether your attitude is tinged with
           enthusiasm, sarcasm, boredom, or like Ashley, a robotic quality, your customer
           will hear you—loudly and clearly. Make sure the attitude you convey is a helpful
           and interested one.
                              Talking on the phone also requires greater listening ability, both
                        on the customer’s part and on your own. Focus on the customer you
                         are helping rather than on the events happening around you. Be a
                        complete listener. Never make a customer repeat a statement because
                         you were not paying attention.
                              Learn the following steps and you will give exceptional customer
                     service to your telephone customers.

           In Diane’s phone call, Ashley could have shown more enthusiasm by answering
           the call, “Thank you for calling VeeJay’s. How can I help you today?” She could have
           interacted more throughout the contact. For example, she could have repeated
           the item name when Diane gave the number, “Item 14236, the denim jacket. What
           size and color would you like that in?” Small verbalizations like these can make a
           big difference with customers. Diane would have had instant confirmation that
           her items were ordered correctly.

           In answer to the question, you may have answered something like:

                    hen you communicate with another person face to face, it can be fairly
           W        easy to fudge when you do not listen completely. You can pick up cues
           by paying attention to a person’s body language. You can drift off and be able to
           pick up somewhere in the middle of the conversation and go with the flow by
           watching the other person’s actions as he or she speaks. Not so when you are on
           the phone. When you cannot see the other person, your only means of com-
           munication is the give and take of listening and talking. When you do not listen
           effectively, it can be pretty tough to respond effectively. When you handle cus-
           tomers by telephone, listen, listen, listen.
               Review Chapter 2, Step 6. Focus entirely on your customer. Listen completely.
           Remain objective; do not judge. Even though it will be difficult for you to listen
           for what is not said when you cannot see the other person, you will be able to
           hear a person’s attitude and emotions by listening carefully to the voice tone.
               Listen to the customer’s opening statement. The first words out of the
           customer’s mouth tell you the reason for the call. Never let the first words out of
           your mouth be to ask your customer to repeat his opening statement because you
           were not giving your full attention.
               Write down or input key points. Have pen and paper ready or have the
           correct computer screen displayed when you take a call. If the customer gives you
           his or her name, write it down. If the customer seems upset, write down the main
           points of the opening statement, for example, Mrs. Brennan—received wrong
           color jacket—got blue, wanted white. You do not have to write verbatim, just
           highlight the key points.
               Listen without interrupting. If Mrs. Brennan is telling you why she is calling
           and you interrupt her midsentence, she is not going to be very happy: “This is
           Mrs. Brennan. I just received my order and one of the items. . . .” “Hold on just a sec-
           ond Mrs. Brennan, I’m finishing up an order. As soon as my screen clears, I’ll be able
           to help you.” If Mrs. Brennan was not upset when she called, she most likely would
           be when the employee interrupted her and was not ready to help. Even if the com-
           puter screen needed to clear, the employee could have listened and jotted down
           the key points.
               Give the customer you are helping your full attention. For example: “This
           is Mrs. Brennan. I just received my order and one of the items isn’t what I ordered.”

           N     with the customer’s opening statement, we can begin the call process.
              Answer on the first ring. Customers expect a business line to be answered
           on the first, and no later than the second, ring. After that, they may hang up. Once
           they hang up, you may have lost a potential customer.
             Give the name of your business, your name, and then an opening state-
           ment or question. When giving your opening question or statement, sound like
           you really want to help the caller. Answer in a professional, yet friendly tone. You
           can sound professional—and—friendly at the same time. With practice, you can
           manage the balance between sounding too mechanical or overly friendly.
               Sound enthusiastic and ready to help. Project enthusiasm and eagerness
           to help in your telephone voice. Listen closely to your customer’s opening state-
           ment and respond accordingly. Never make a customer repeat information be-
           cause you failed to listen or because you were not prepared to make note of his
           request.
               Work on relationship building from the beginning of the contact. Make
           a good first impression by speaking in a friendly voice that conveys a willingness
           to help. Establish a rapport by finding common ground. Address the customer
           by name if you know it.




           Addressing the Customer by Name

           It is generally all right to use the customer’s first name if that is the introduction
           provided. Use good judgment on this and, when in doubt, address the customer
           using Mr., Mrs., or Ms. and the last name. Let the customer be the one to let you
           know if it is all right to use a first name.

HOW COULD ASHLEY START HER PHONE CONTACT IN A MORE
POSITIVE MANNER?

   “Thank you for calling VeeJay’s Sportswear. My name is Ashley. How may
   I help you today?”

Ashley answered the call on the first ring. She gave the name of the business, her
name, and asked how she could help. Her enthusiasm and willingness to help
came through to Diane.

TRAINING         STEP 3:     Between Hello and Goodbye:
   101
                             Helping the Customer
                etween hello and goodbye, you have the opportunity to handle your cus-
           B    tomer’s request in a manner that leaves her feeling good about calling your
           company. You can also handle your customer’s request in a manner that leaves
           her wondering why she bothered calling. You are your company’s voice; how you
           handle your customer’s request by telephone is how the customer is going to re-
           member your company. Be sure you represent it well.
               Assure the customer you can help. Respond to your customer’s opening
           statement with an assurance that you can help. Say something like, “Absolutely. I
           can help you with that.” Even if you are going to refer the customer to another de-
           partment or employee, you can give an assurance. Say, “I’m going to transfer you
           to the department that can take care of this for you, but I will stay on the line until
           someone answers.”
               Summarize the customer’s opening statement. Before you attempt to
           handle a customer’s request, make sure you understand what the customer wants.
           Recap what the customer said without repeating it verbatim. In Mrs. Brennan’s
           call you could say, “You received your order, but we sent you a blue jacket instead
           of white?” This way the customer will clear up any confusion before you go on,
           “No, I received a white jacket but I wanted blue.” If it is a short request, such as
           Diane’s call to place an order, incorporate the summary into your assurance
           statement, “I’ll be happy to take your catalog order.”
               Verbalize what you are doing. Tell your customer what you are doing
           throughout the contact. Never assume the person on the other end understands.
           During silences, the customer may be wondering if you are still there. This does
           not mean you need to constantly chatter your way through the contact, but you
           should tell your customer what you are doing to help. If you need to ask a series
           of questions to help, explain what you will be doing so the customer does not
           think you are interrogating, “Mrs. Brennan, I’m going to need some additional in-
           formation to help you. Do you have your invoice handy?” Now when you begin ask-
           ing questions, Mrs. Brennan understands what you are doing.
               Put your personal touch into the contact. You can maintain profession-
           alism but show your human side. Talk to the customer while you are waiting for
           a computer screen to change, “It’ll be just a moment for the next screen. How are

                                                                                             SAYING IT

so. Follow up with, “I’ll check with my supervisor. I want to make sure I handle this
                                                                                            TELEPHONE
correctly.”                                                                                 CONTACTS




           If you are a new employee, it is all right to say so. Everyone has been new
           at a job, and customers will not only relate but will appreciate your hon-
esty. You can explain, “I appreciate your patience. I’m new and I want to make sure I in-
put everything correctly for you.”




           Now is a good time to make sure you are completely familiar with your
           company’s procedures and policies. Ask yourself: Have I been trained to
do my job? Do I have the necessary tools to work effectively and efficiently? If not,
tell your manager what training you need. Keep up to date on changes in your work-
place by asking questions to learn more about your job and your company.



   Before a lengthy pause, tell the customer what is happening. There are
many instances in which you will need to pause the conversation. For example,
you might need to wait for the order to process, wait for another computer screen
to come up, read notes from previous contacts, or are a new employee and not
working up to speed yet. Let the customer know why you are pausing the con-
versation. This will avoid awkward silences. You can say, “It’ll take a moment for
the order to process. Then I can give you a confirmation number. I’ll be on the line
with you, though.”
    When putting customers on hold, explain why. This is a common courtesy
your customers will appreciate, “Mrs. Brennan, I’m going to put you on hold so I
can see what happened with your order.” In addition, tell your customer approxi-
mately how long it will take, “It may take me a few minutes to get the information
I need to help you.” If you put a customer on hold and then find it is taking longer
than you thought, return to the line to give an update, “Mr. Perkins, I’m still
waiting for my technician to give me an answer. It shouldn’t take that much longer.”
When you come back to the line, thank the customer for waiting, “Mr. Perkins,
thank you for holding. The technician explained. . . .”

   101                If the wait time will be extremely long, offer a call back. Always make a
                      specific commitment. Say, “I’ll get back to you by five today with the informa-
           tion,” rather than “I’ll call you back as soon as possible.” As soon as possible may mean
           one time frame to you, an entirely different time frame to your customers.




           Outgoing Telephone Contacts

           If your job requires you to make outgoing phone contacts, come up with an out-
           line for handling these type calls. Include:
           ➔ Greeting—introduce yourself and your company
           ➔ Explain the reason for your call up front
           ➔ Know what you are going to say before you call
           ➔ Practice your message before calling

           If your company makes cold calls for sales, come up with a framework for the di-
           alogue you will use. Practice by role playing the contact before you actually make
           a call.




           HOW COULD ASHLEY HELP DIANE MORE EFFECTIVELY?

                 “Hi, I’d like to place a catalog order.”

   that?”

Ashley assured Diane she could help and summarized the reason for the call. She

explained the reason. She built a relationship throughout the contact by being

                earning how to effectively handle customer contacts by telephone begins
           L    when you answer, continues when you take care of the customer’s request,
           and ends when you say goodbye. Remember, telephone customers are going to
           judge your company by their interactions with you. Ending the call effectively
           will make your customers feel good that they did business with your company.
               Recap what you are going to do. When you have finished handling the cus-
           tomer’s request, end the contact on a positive note by assuring the customer that
           you either have or will handle the request. Say something like, “Mr. Downs, I have
           issued a credit for the finance charge.” In the case of a lengthy request, it is not nec-
           essary to recap each item. You could say, “Mr. Downs, I’ve issued a credit and noted
           your account of the other items we discussed.”
               Gain the customer’s acceptance. When you recap, the customer knows
           exactly what you will be doing. Wait for the customer’s acknowledgment and
           acceptance to make sure you handled everything correctly. If you recapped in-
           correctly, the customer will let you know. Doing this will cut down on errors and
           will ultimately increase customer satisfaction.
               Ask if you can help with anything else. This is another way to show your
           human touch and also a nice way to end the contact. Asking this simple question
           gives your customers a chance to pause and think before hanging up. They will
           appreciate the memory jogger.
               Give your name again. Let the customer know you will be happy to help if
           she needs to call back. Say something like:, “My name is Ashley, and if you need
           anything else I’ll be glad to help you with it.” If you work in a large call center that
           would make it difficult for the customer to reach you personally, say: “My name
           is Ashley. Your order has been processed. I’ll give you the confirmation number as
           soon as it comes up. If you need to call back anyone can access your order either by
           the confirmation number or by your name and address.”
               Thank the customer for calling your business. Always end on a positive
           note, “Thank you for calling (name) Company. Have a great day.”

   101

           Have you ever been guilty of not listening to your telephone customers?

           Sean called the telephone company to establish new local service. The represen-
           tative was friendly, but she appeared preoccupied. Twice during the contact Sean
           told the employee that he was not moving until the following month and did not
           want service to begin until then.
               “We can install your phone service next Tuesday.”
               “No. Remember, I told you I don’t want my service to start until September
           23. I’m remodeling the home and that’s the date I’ll be moving into it.”
               “Oh, that’s right. You did tell me that. . . .”
               After spending nearly an hour setting up his new phone service, Sean did
           not feel completely comfortable when he hung up. I just know something is going
           to go wrong, he thought.
               Two weeks later Sean received a phone bill for his new service. The date the
           service began was the Tuesday the representative first offered him. He was not
           surprised, but he was upset.
               The employee’s mistake cost him one more hour on the telephone straight-
           ening the mess out. Had the representative given him her full attention, this
           would not have happened. By the time he finished the second call, Sean had little
           confidence in the company.

CUSTOMER
 SERVICE        E-commerce has grown exponentially in the past few years.
TRAINING
           Customers, who only a few years ago were leery of conducting
   101
           business over the Internet, now do so with ease. Customers find
           it simple and convenient to do business online, as long as they
           feel the company is reputable. Consumers’ growing comfort level
           with the Internet has opened up the global market faster than
           any other medium. We now have virtually unlimited options.
                When conducting E-commerce, communication requires
           yet another skill set. Communication, primarily handled through
           E-mail, is a great way to formulate thoughts, but you must take special care to
           make sure that what you write is what you mean to write. Learning to write well
           by formulating your thoughts clearly and conveying the correct message is the
           most important skill for E-commerce customer service contacts.



                                                          PICTURE
                                                          THIS

                 Mr. Bowman is interested in buying a new set of golf clubs, so he
                 surfed the Internet for information. He used a key word search and
                 one of the Web sites he checked offers the set he wants at a good
                 price. He is unclear about shipping charges and sends an E-mail query.
                 Tom, an employee at the sporting goods store, replies to Mr. Bow-
                 man’s E-mail by writing the following:

                     The shipping charges to send the set of golf clubs you inquired
                     about will be $3.00.
                     Nineteenth Hole Golf Company

                     Tom hits the send button. Later he is reviewing the E-mail and
                 reads—$3.00. He meant to type $30.00. Small mistake. Costly dif-
                 ference. How is Mr. Bowman going to feel if he places his order and
                 finds out he was quoted the wrong shipping charges?

           What Went Wrong?

           Tom was hasty in hitting the send button without proofreading the E-mail. If the
           customer places an order, Tom and his company have two options: either eat the
                                                                                         145

                           quickly cut into its profit margin. Telling the customer
                           he was quoted an incorrect rate can cause the customer
                           to lose faith in the company. It can cost the company a
sale and a potential future customer relationship.
    Valuing your E-prospects and giving them exceptional service online can turn
prospective buyers into loyal customers. Customers who interact with a business
over the Internet deserve the same level of customer service as face-to-face and
telephone customers.
    Master the following steps and you will be able to handle any E-customer in
any E-situation.

       STEP 1:What Does the E-Customer Expect?
       STEP 2: Hanging the Open Sign: Being Accessible
       STEP 3:Writing What You Mean: E-mail Communication
       STEP 4: Speaking Around the World: Cross-Cultural Etiquette


In the contact between Tom and Mr. Bowman, had Tom carefully read the E-mail
before hitting the send button, he might have caught and corrected the mistake.
Now he is caught in a dilemma.
    Before we go into E-commerce customer service, we need to discuss Web sites.
Many companies now have a Web site. How your company’s Web site is designed
can make the difference between increased sales and frustrated surfers. As a
group, review your Web site from a customer’s viewpoint.




Building a Winning Web Site
The most important factor when building a Web site is to make it easy for your
customers to navigate. Slow response times, complicated order blanks, and busy
or confusing pages can easily turn a potential customer away. The best way to de-
termine how your customers navigate through your site is to check it out yourself.
  146
CUSTOMER
 SERVICE   Pretend you know nothing about your company. Navigate your site as though you
TRAINING
           are a potential customer. Place a dummy order. Make note of the aspects of your
   101
           site that are good and the aspects that need improvement.
               Things to help you build a winning Web site:

           ➔ Keep text to a minimum. In general, people prefer nonbusy pages when
             reading computer screens.

           ➔ When using photos or other graphics, make sure they do not grind the
             surfing pace to a halt.

           ➔ Make sure ordering is easy by monitoring the product information page,
             shopping cart, customer registration, billing information, and final checkout.

           ➔ Include warranty or guarantee information and information about technical
             support, if appropriate, on your site.

           ➔ Include a “contact the company” button for easy E-mailing.

           ➔ Select words and phrases customers are likely to use for key word searches.

      he E-customer can be anybody from anywhere. When you do business over
T     the Internet, you open your door to customers around the globe. Customers
who transact business over the Internet put their blind faith in your company.
They deserve the same level of customer service you give your local customers.
    When they enter your E-business, your potential customers have no idea what
your business looks like. They cannot tell if your company is a multimillion dol-
lar corporation or a small business run out of a home or a strip mall location. No
matter how large or small your company is, it is important that you handle all
your E-customers with professionalism and courtesy.
    What are your customers looking for?
    They want to know you are legitimate. Your home page is your customer’s
first step into your door. How your “door step” is laid out can either invite cus-
tomers in or make them go elsewhere. Tell customers, up front, that you are a
legitimate company and that you stand behind your products. Explain your
service and product guarantees on your home page, if possible. By telling your
customers that you care enough about them to guarantee their satisfaction,
you are telling them that you value them as customers. Reiterate this in all E-mail
correspondence.
    They want to know you are trustworthy. You show you are trustworthy by
the way you interact with your customers. Promptly answer all customer E-mail
queries. When customers place orders, send detailed order confirmation E-mails.
When you demonstrate to customers you are reliable and informative by re-
sponding quickly and effectively through E-communication, they will be more
comfortable placing their trust in you and your company.
    They want to know you will do what you say you will when you say you
will. When customers ask questions, respond to their E-mails promptly. When
they place orders, get them out quickly. Do not make your E-customers wait
longer than if they came in to your business to buy something. If a customer sends
you an E-mail query and you take a week to answer it or answer it in a haphaz-
ard manner, you do not look very reputable. If it takes so long to send an E-mail,
how long will it take to process an order or handle a problem? Responding to
E-mail queries promptly shows you are interested in your E-customers.
  148
CUSTOMER
 SERVICE      They want to know you have a human touch. When customers E-mail you
TRAINING
           for information, always put a human touch in your replies. Imagine you are

           communicating with a customer who is in your business. Let your personality
           come through in your E-mails by being responsive, friendly, and professional.




           HOW COULD TOM HAVE BEEN MORE EFFECTIVE IN HIS RESPONSE?

           Tom’s initial reply to Mr. Bowman looked as though it was stock text that he
           copied into the E-mail. Now Tom responds differently.

              The shipping charges to send the complete set will be $30.00. We stand be-
              hind all our equipment. Your satisfaction is always guaranteed.
                  We look forward to hearing from you and doing business with you.

              Sincerely,
              Nineteenth Hole Golf Company

           This E-mail is an improvement over the first because Tom added a human touch
           in the text by showing his interest in doing business with Mr. Bowman. He clearly
           told Mr. Bowman that his satisfaction is guaranteed, which lends legitimacy to
           the company.




           What’s in a Name?

           Unless your company is an easily recognized name, customers will find you by
           doing a key word search on a search engine. Come up with words and phrases
           your customers are most likely to use to find your business.

        hen you conduct business over the Internet, customers feel welcome to
W       come in to your business twenty-four hours a day. When you do busi-
ness over the Internet, you have no office hours, so it is important for you to be
accessible to your customers. Remember, your E-customers do not know a one-
person operation from a business that employs thousands.



          Tell your customers when you are open. If you are closed weekends, spec-
          ify this on your Web site so customers who E-mail you Friday evening will
not look for a reply until Monday. Also, note all contact information on the site. Tell
customers your physical address (or post office box number), phone, fax, and pager
numbers as appropriate.



    Respond to E-customers quickly. You build credibility as a company by be-
ing responsive to all your customers. Give your E-customers the same impor-
tance as if they were in your business looking at you. Thank the customer for his
interest in your company and products. Anticipate other questions the customer
may have and address them in your E-mail. In other words, give more than is
asked for. For example, Tom could have added information about order pro-
cessing and shipping schedules in his E-mail to Mr. Bowman. Not only would
this have added a human touch; it would have provided Mr. Bowman with the
additional information that could have clinched the sale.
    Process orders quickly. When customers do business over the Internet they
want to know their orders will be quickly processed. When an order has been
shipped, send a confirmation E-mail. Thank the customer for the order, sum-
marize what was shipped, when it was shipped, and provide tracking information.
When an item is backordered, let the customer know the approximate shipping
date. Assure the customer you will not bill his or her credit card until the item is
shipped and give an option if he or she does not want to proceed with the order.
    Build customer loyalty through E-mailing. Always thank customers for
their interest in your company. Use E-mails to tell customers about sales, special

TRAINING
           them know what is happening in your business. Always include an opt-out for
   101
           those customers who do not want to receive unsolicited E-mails. If you deal with
           the same E-customers repeatedly, keep in contact with them through thinking of
           you or how are you doing E-mails. Keeping your company’s name in the cus-
           tomers’ minds not only can generate additional sales, it tells your customers you
           value their business.

      y now, Tom’s E-mail sounds much better than his first one. As you saw, it is
B     easy to make a mistake when typing is your means of communication.
Chances for miscommunication increase when you type rather than speak your
answer.
     When E-mail is your means of communicating with your customers, you
want to make sure that what you write is what you mean to write. Take special
care before hitting the send button.
     Use good communication skills. Begin with your subject line. Make sure
it reflects the content of your E-mail. For example, Order Confirmation tells your
customer exactly what she will be reading when she opens the E-mail. In the body
of the letter, interject words like yes, I’ll be happy to take care of that, absolutely, or
I’ve taken care of that for you. Using the same words in E-mails that you use in
oral communication lets your personality come through. Writing Thank you for
doing business. . . . or We appreciate your business. . . . lets your company’s per-
sonality come through as well.
     Begin with a salutation. Begin your E-mails with a personal touch: Dear
Mr. Bowman. . . . Mr. Bowman knows the E-mail is directed to him specifically.
If you do not know the name, begin with a generic salutation reflective of your
business, such as Greetings from Nineteenth Hole Golf Company or Dear Fellow
Golfer.
     Make messages visually interesting. Keep your messages short. When cus-
tomers see a long block of print, chances are they are going to skip over parts
of the message. Use short sentences and action verbs to express yourself: We
shipped your order. . . . rather than The order was shipped. . . . Use short paragraphs
and double spacing between them to create open space in the body of your mes-
sages. Use bullets or headings when possible.
     Write as you would say it. If you are unsure of your wording, speak the mes-
sage out loud to hear how it sounds. Put the most important items first. Write
clearly and specifically. Do not depend solely on your computer’s spellcheck to
spot misspellings. Carefully proofread all messages. Keep the shortcut lingo (lol,
jk, etc.) for your friends, not your business customers. Reread all E-mail messages
before hitting the send button.
  152
CUSTOMER
 SERVICE      Add an interesting closing. Say something specific. This is a good place to
TRAINING
           interject your company’s personality by adding a line to show your customer you

           title or the name of your business.

           IN HIS RESPONSE?

TRAINING          STEP 4:   Speaking Around the World:
   101
                           Cross-Cultural Etiquette
                     e live in a world made up of many cultures, customs, and languages. The
           W         Internet has shrunk our world so much that it is important to learn
           how to speak around the globe. Even though we may speak different languages,
           some communication skills are universal. Did you know there is a version of the
           Golden Rule in every culture? The words, depending on the origin, are different
           from those we learned as children, but the meaning is the same.
               Treat other people as you want to be treated. The following qualities
           translate into every language: showing respect, being considerate of others, having
           a helpful attitude, using basic courtesies, displaying compassion and empathy for
           others, and treating people as individuals. When you do these things, you can
           learn to effectively communicate across language or cultural barriers.
               Read carefully so you will “listen” well. People may write in a way that makes
           it difficult for you to understand the message when you first read it. When you
           receive an E-mail that is not clear, reread it carefully word for word to make sure
           you understand the meaning correctly.
               Use correct grammar. Your E-customers may not understand jargon or
           slang. When you get in the habit of using correct grammar every time you speak
           and write, people will better understand your message. Do not try to mimic other
           peoples’ manner of speaking. Be yourself and speak and write in your normal
           voice, but be mindful that language differences may hamper communication
           effectiveness.
               Be a professional. You show you are a professional by not stereotyping other
           people, not talking down to others, and not making assumptions. When you treat
           other people with dignity, you show that you are respectful and tolerant. Always
           be professional in your responses and give a complete explanation of any words
           or terms your E-customer might not understand.

           Have you ever caused an E-customer to lose trust in you?

           Lori needed to purchase a gift for a wedding. She knew the bride’s china pattern
           and thought it would be convenient to place her order online. She did a word
           search for the pattern, chose a company at random, and found what she wanted
           on the site.
               The items were priced reasonably, but Lori wanted to know if they were in
           stock before placing her order. She E-mailed the company and waited for an an-
           swer. After two days without any response, she again searched the Internet for
           another company, choosing another one at random. She found the items she
           was interested in purchasing. This company also had a current listing of in-stock
           pieces, so Lori had immediate confirmation that her items were in stock and would
           be shipped. This lent credibility to the company. She placed her order and re-
           ceived an immediate confirmation E-mail that her order had been received. The
           following day Lori received another E-mail confirming that the order had been
           shipped.
               That day the first company replied to her E-mail; the items she wanted were
           in stock. It was too late. Lori lost trust in the company when it did not reply in a
           timely manner. If a company does not answer its E-mails quickly, she thought, how
           reliable would it be if I ordered?
               Lori was reasonable and patient by giving the first company ample time to
           answer her E-mail. When it did not respond, she lost faith in the company.
           Chances are next time Lori needs to order china online, she will choose the
           company that responded quickly to her needs.

CUSTOMER
 SERVICE       You have covered a lot of ground so far. You have learned
TRAINING
           how to effectively communicate and build relationships with
   101
           your customers. You have learned special skills to interact
           with customers face to face, by telephone, and online. You
           have valuable techniques to effectively handle your customers,
           but there is still the dreaded difficult customer. A difficult cus-
           tomer can rattle even the most patient, the most composed
           customer service employee. Learning how to deal with a dif-
           ficult customer will give you the self-assurance to effectively
           help each and every one of your customers.
                                    Customers may be difficult to deal with for several reasons.
                                They may be upset because something was mishandled by your
                                company, frustrated about a delay in handling a request, im-
                                  patient about your company’s response time, or maybe they
                                 are having a bad day and taking their frustration out on you.
                                  Whatever the reason for being difficult, how well you handle
                                  each difficult customer can determine whether or not they
           remain your customers in the future.

                       “Mike, This is Mr. Roberts. My service contract number is
                  ACH2234. I’m not very happy right now. I called early this morning,
                  and you were supposed to send a service person before noon. Now
                  it’s twelve thirty, and no one’s showed.”
                       “Hold on,” Mike answers with a slight tinge of rudeness in his voice.
                       “Hold on? I don’t want to hold on. My time is valuable, and I don’t
                  have all day to wait around. I want to know how soon someone will
                  be out.”
                                                                                        163

       out.”
           “I’m telling you someone was supposed to be here.”
           “Just a minute, I’m still checking our records. . . . OK, I see what
       happened. Looks like when you called this morning we did tell you
       we could send a person right out, but you told us you were going to call
       back to schedule the service call.We have no record that you called us back.
       I can schedule you for service tomorrow.”
           “I’m not waiting until tomorrow. I told the employee I would call
       back if I couldn’t rearrange my schedule. She told me I was scheduled
       for this morning.The appointment was set.Tomorrow isn’t satisfactory.
       I want someone out now.”
           “Evidently you told the rep you were going to call back. That’s
       what she noted on the record. If you had scheduled an appointment
       when you spoke to her we would have sent someone out.”
           “I know what was said in our conversation, and I know I was
       scheduled for service this morning.”
           “Well, the soonest we can be out is tomorrow.”
           “Tomorrow isn’t satisfactory. I’ve been sitting home all morning
       waiting for the service person.”
           “We don’t have service people just sitting here waiting for calls.
       Everyone has already been dispatched today.”
           “Obviously I’m not getting through to you. I had an appointment
       for this morning. The person hasn’t arrived. I need a person out this
       afternoon. Let me speak to a supervisor.”


What Went Wrong?

Did Mr. Roberts cause his own problem by saying he would call back?
    Did the representative clearly state that she would not make an appointment
until he called back?
    When Mike received this call, he could not immediately tell what had happened.
From what Mr. Roberts had told him, it was clear that there was a miscommuni-
cation with the previous representative. Whether Mr. Roberts has a valid reason
  164

It is not always easy to know what to say or how to handle customers who are
upset from the moment you begin your conversation. However, satisfying a cus-
tomer who is angry, upset, aggressive, or even rude can be accomplished in any
situation. How well you are able to calm difficult customers will make the differ-
ence between satisfying them and fostering their feelings of frustration.
     Remember the next time a customer complains, there usually is a legiti-
mate reason. Sometimes, though, you will deal with customers who have no ba-
sis for their complaints. By learning how to tactfully handle a difficult customer
in any situation you can make every customer feel satisfied at the end of the
contact.
     Master and practice the five-step process and you will arm yourself with the
confidence to positively handle any customer in any situation.

     STEP 1:What Is Going on: Determine the Reason
     STEP 2:What Caused It: Identify the Root Cause of the Problem
     STEP 3:What Can I Do: Rectify the Situation
     STEP 4:What Can I Say:Acknowledge the Problem
     STEP 5:What Needs to Be Done: Fix What Needs to Be Fixed

In the contact with Mr. Roberts, Mike could have done many things differently.
Mr. Roberts’ perception was that he had an appointment. Mr. Roberts’ percep-
tion about the situation is what is important. Who is right and who is wrong is
not important. Making the transition from difficult customer to satisfied customer
is important.

In answer to the questions, Mike may have said something like:

   What do you think about the manner in which Mike spoke to Mr. Roberts?
     Mike became defensive.
     He spoke in a rude tone.

           How effective was Mike in helping Mr. Roberts?
             Not very. Mr. Roberts became even more upset.

      he first step is the most critical. What you say, what you do not say, and how
T     you say it are all important. Your customer is upset, and you do not want to
do anything to make him more upset.
    Assure the customer you are going to help. In your opening statement, tell
your customer you will do what you can to resolve the problem. When you give
your assurance up front, it can help put your customer in a different frame of
mind.
    Restate the customer’s opening statement. Customers who are upset or
angry may not communicate well. They may ramble, raise their voices, and not
be able to verbalize what is going on. By restating the opening statement before
going any further, you will make sure you are on the right track.
    Listen carefully. After assuring the customer you are going to help, listen to
the story without interrupting. Listen to the complaint and the reason why the
customer is being difficult. Mr. Roberts’ complaint is that the service person was
supposed to be dispatched in the morning. His reason for being difficult is that he
is frustrated because he spent valuable time waiting and no one arrived. By ac-
tively listening to what the customer is saying rather than the way it is said, you
will be able to stay focused on providing help. If the customer is having trouble
articulating, say something such as, “Please tell me what happened when you called
earlier.”
    Write down key details. Pay attention to clues that will help you understand
what happened. Make note of things that will help you solve the problem, such
as the dates the customer called, what he or she was told by whom, and what
actually happened.
    Display empathy. Before you proceed, let the customer know that you under-
stand her feelings. Reassure her again that you will help. Try to put yourself in
your customer’s shoes. No matter how a customer speaks to you, look at the
problem from his or her perspective. You will be surprised how much clearer the
problem will be when you see the situation from the customer’s vantage point
rather than your own.
    Remain composed. It is important that you stay composed from the begin-
ning of your contact with a difficult customer. A customer speaking angrily or
  168
CUSTOMER
 SERVICE   condescendingly may cause you to react in the same manner and tone. Becom-
TRAINING
           ing defensive and mirroring a customer’s behavior will only agitate the customer
   101
           further. By maintaining self-control, you will give yourself time to analyze the
           cause for the customer’s anger. When you remain calm, the customer will begin
           to calm down. You will defuse the fuse.



                     Remember that a difficult customer is not angry at you personally. Think
                     about this the next time someone is upset or difficult. Even if the cus-
           tomer refers to the company as you, as Mr. Roberts did with Mike, and you know
           you personally were not the cause of the problem, remember the customer is not
           attacking you. The customer sees you as the company. Focus solely on the cus-
           tomer’s problem to keep from becoming defensive.




           HOW COULD MIKE HAVE HANDLED THE BEGINNING OF THE
           CONTACT BETTER?

              “ABC Appliance Repair, this is Mike speaking.”
                 “Mike, This is Mr. Roberts. My service contract number is ACH2234.
              I’m not very happy right now. I called early this morning, and you were
              supposed to send a service person before noon. Now it’s twelve thirty and
              no one’s showed.”
                 “Mr. Roberts, I’ll be happy to help you. You had a service appointment
              scheduled for this morning?”
                 “Yes, that’s correct. I called first thing. The employee I spoke with told
              me she could send someone out this morning. I’ve been waiting all morn-
              ing and no one came. I’m a busy person, and my time is valuable. I need
              someone out right away.”
                 “I understand. I’ll need to check our records to see what happened.
              Can you hold while I do that?”
                 “Yes, I’ll hold.”
                                                                                                         169

Mike assured Mr. Roberts he would resolve his problem. Next he restated Mr.                            THE STORM:
                                                                                                        DIFFICULT
Roberts’ opening statement to make sure he understood the problem. Then Mike
                                                                                                       CUSTOMER
actively listened and noted that Mr. Roberts was upset because he waited for a                         CONTACTS
service person all morning. He displayed empathy by telling Mr. Roberts he under-
stood and said he would need to check the records. By handling the customer in
a calm, unthreatening manner, he displayed confidence to Mr. Roberts that he
would resolve the problem.



            If an angry customer immediately asks for your manager or the owner of
            your company without first giving you a chance to help, try this approach:
“Ms. Customer, please give me the opportunity to resolve the problem. I’m confident that
I will be able to help you, but if you are still not satisfied, I will personally refer your problem
to my manager (or owner).” Your confident manner will give the customer the peace
of mind that you are truly interested in resolving her problem.




           If a customer uses profanity, calmly say “Mr. Customer, I understand you are
           upset, and I am going to help you, but there is no reason to use profanity.” In
most cases the customer will stop. If he continues, calmly say, “I am going to work
with you to resolve your problem.Will you please explain to me what happened without
using profanity?” Again, by maintaining a calm demeanor, your customer will begin to
calm down.

TRAINING           STEP 2:  What Caused It: Identify the
   101
                          Root Cause of the Problem
                  nce you determine the reason the customer is upset, your next step is to
           O      figure out the cause of the problem. In Mr. Roberts’ case, Mike should have
           a clear idea of the complaint. Mr. Roberts called earlier and scheduled a morn-
           ing appointment. He is upset because it is past noon and no one has been out.
           Now Mike can figure out what caused the problem.
               Investigate the situation. Mike asked Mr. Roberts to hold so he could find
           out what happened. Mike can check while the customer holds by reviewing the
           customer’s account record and the appointment log. When the investigation will
           take longer, make a specific commitment to get back to the customer. When
           making commitments to call back it is important to give a specific time frame
           rather than telling the customer you will call back “as soon as possible” or “right
           away.” Terms like these mean different things to different people. Right away
           might mean sometime today to you—it could mean within fifteen minutes to
           your customer.



                     When you need to get back to a customer, make a reasonable commit-
                     ment. Do not try to appease your customer by giving her a commitment
           you know is impossible to meet. She will only become more upset when you do
           not have an answer. Think about the length of time you will need to find out what
           happened. Then, realistically tell the customer when to expect a response.




                       When a customer is dissatisfied with the commitment time you give, try
                       saying:“Ms. Customer, that’s the best I can do knowing what I need to do in my
           investigation. I’d rather be honest with you and give you a realistic commitment that I know
           I can meet.”



              Determine if the customer has a valid complaint. After investigating, you
           should be able to figure out whether the customer’s complaint is legitimate. Most
                                                                                         171

likely it will be. If, after your investigation, you cannot determine what caused      THE STORM:
                                                                                        DIFFICULT

                                                                                       CUSTOMER
going to know who caused the miscommunication. From his investigation, he              CONTACTS
knows the root cause is the misunderstanding that occurred between Mr. Roberts
and the first employee. Mike knows that Mr. Roberts expected a service person
to be dispatched this morning. He should assume that Mr. Roberts’ perception is
correct.
    Apologize. What is said next is crucial. First, say “I’m sorry.” It is the right
thing to do whether or not your company is at fault. Whenever someone or some-
thing causes your customers to be upset, apologizing will let them know you care.
    Explain what happened. After you apologize, tell the customer what hap-
pened. Stick to the facts. Keep the emotion out of it. Be truthful, even when your
company made a mistake. The customer may not like the answer, but your hon-
esty will be appreciated. In the end, a customer is going to respect an employee
who is frank and honest over one who evades, covers up, or lies.




HOW COULD MIKE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE ROOT CAUSE OF
MR. ROBERTS’ PROBLEM?
   “Yes, I’ll hold.”
       “Mr. Roberts, thank you for holding. I checked our records, and I apol-
   ogize that we weren’t out this morning. From what I can tell when you
   spoke to the employee, she was under the assumption that you needed
   to call back to schedule your appointment. The reason we weren’t out is
   that we didn’t hear back from you and therefore never scheduled the serv-
   ice call.”

Mike took the time to investigate and determine the root cause. He could not
determine whether the customer’s complaint was valid since it was the result of
a miscommunication. He apologized and stayed neutral when he explained what
happened. By staying neutral, Mike is not taking or assigning blame.

           What to Do When Customers Do Not Have Valid Complaints

           In the event that the customer has no basis for a complaint, you and your man-
           ager will need to make a decision whether to appease him or her. Pacifying cus-
           tomers who do not have valid complaints can become costly—only your company
           knows what price you can pay to keep a customer.
               Each case will be different; you will need to decide which customers are worth
           the effort. What are some situations that may arise in your business where a cus-
           tomer has no basis for her complaint? Think about the following questions, and
           come up with some guidelines for handling these situations.

           ➔ Is this a one-time complaint or is the customer a chronic complainer?

           ➔ What is your previous relationship with this customer?

           ➔ Does the customer do enough business with your company to make the
             aggravation worthwhile?

           There will be occasions when you will need to make the tough decision that it is
           not cost effective to keep doing business with a customer who requires more than
           you can afford to satisfy. In these cases, refer to your manager as the one to end
           the business relationship.

     ou investigated and determined the cause of the problem. Now it is time to
Y    offer a solution. If you can rectify the problem to the customer’s satisfaction,
you get off easy. “Mr. Roberts, we have a service person who just called in. We’re dis-
patching her to your home, and she’ll be there within fifteen minutes.”
    How many times does that happen? More than likely the solution you are
going to offer is not what the customer wants to hear. How you handle this will
make a big difference in what happens next.
    Tell the customer what you are going to do to solve the problem. Explain
to your customer exactly what you will be able to do to rectify the problem. Take
a deep breath before proceeding. Think about what you will say and how you are
going to say it.
    Focus on what you can do. Always focus on the positive of what you can
do, rather than on what you cannot do. In the case of Mr. Roberts, all the service
people have their schedules for today so sending someone out this afternoon is
not an option. What can Mike do for him? Before offering the solution, perhaps
Mike can check with his dispatcher to see if he can schedule a service call for
the first appointment tomorrow morning. While this is not the ideal solution
Mr. Roberts is expecting, it does narrow his wait time and gives him preferential
treatment.
    Offer your best solution. This is not the time to offer something mediocre
and begin a bartering session for a better solution. By offering the best you can
do, you will be more confident in presenting the solution. Putting yourself in the
customer’s shoes will help you understand how your solution may be received.
    Never assign blame. When you offer your solution, do not fault the customer.
For example, how would you feel hearing the following: “If you had scheduled
your appointment the first time you called we would have come out.” Statements
like this will put the customer on the defensive. When you are trying to help a
difficult customer, blaming serves no purpose. Likewise, never blame another
employee or department. Saying, “The first employee you spoke with should have
scheduled your appointment,” may relieve you from blame, but this statement
serves no purpose. To the customer, you are the company. Use I or we when re-
ferring to your company to show you are accountable.
  174
CUSTOMER
 SERVICE      Display empathy. If the customer expresses dissatisfaction, which he very well
TRAINING
           may do, let him know you understand. Understanding can often help mend broken
   101
           bridges. You may not be able to fix the problem exactly how he would like but at
           least you can let him know you understand his feelings and what he is going through.
               Offer an alternative solution. If your best solution is not suitable for the
           customer, try to find something that will work. In the case of Mr. Roberts, per-
           haps he cannot be home tomorrow morning. Offer a different time frame. If you
           are at a loss to know how to resolve a problem, ask the customer what she would
           do to solve the problem if this were her business. Asking that question will help the
           customer walk in your shoes. Work together to come up with a realistic solution
           that is mutually acceptable.




           HOW COULD MIKE HAVE RECTIFIED THE SITUATION WITH
           MR. ROBERTS?

              “All our service people have already been dispatched for today but here’s
              what I can do for you. I checked with our dispatch department to get you
              the earliest possible appointment. We can schedule you for the first ap-
              pointment tomorrow. Someone will be out before nine.”
                  “I want someone out today.”
                  “I understand. If I waited all morning, I’d be upset too. I wish I could
              change what happened on your first phone call. It looks like there was a
              mix up in the communication since you thought you were scheduled
              and the employee thought you had to call back. Unfortunately, all our
              service people have already been dispatched for today. That’s why I
              checked with my dispatcher to get you the best appointment for tomor-
              row morning. I know this isn’t what you were hoping for, but it’s the best
              I can do and at least you won’t have to wait all morning again.”
                  “You say the person will be here before nine?”
                  “Yes, we already have you set up. I get in at eight tomorrow, and I’ll per-
              sonally follow up on this to make sure nothing goes wrong again.”
                  “Well, Mike, I do appreciate you doing what you can. I guess tomor-
              row first thing is the best you can do.”
                  “Yes, sir, it is.”

he did not assign blame, either to Mr. Roberts or to the previous employee.



          Taking the time to adequately explain your solution will help you com-
          municate more effectively. Tell the customer what you can do, but also
explain why that is your best solution.




What to Do When the Customer Still Is Not Satisfied

What happens when you cannot resolve the problem to the customer’s satisfac-
tion? What if Mr. Roberts still demanded an appointment today?
   Discuss situations where you were unable to obtain a satisfactory solution to
a customer’s problem. How should you handle customers whose requests are
impossible to satisfy? Think about the following questions and come up with
some guidelines.

➔ What alternative solutions can you offer customers?

➔ What should you say to customers you cannot satisfy?

➔ At what point should you involve your manager (or owner)?

There may be times when, no matter what you offer, you cannot rectify the
problem to the customer’s satisfaction. When this happens, make sure to com-
municate that you appreciate the customer’s point of view. State that you did
your best, there is nothing more you can do, and you are sorry you were not able
to work out a satisfactory solution.

TRAINING                       What Can I Say:
                              STEP 4:
   101
                         Acknowledge the Problem
                    hat you say next can go a long way in restoring a broken relationship. Just
           W        as in a personal relationship, when something damages that bond you
           have to work hard to rebuild the relationship. The same goes for your business
           relationships.
               Thank the customer for allowing you to make things right. After you sat-
           isfactorily resolve a customer’s problem, go one step further and say thank you.
           You cannot take back what happened, but you can do something to let your cus-
           tomer know you value him or her as much as you value the business.
               Tell what you will do to avoid future problems. OK, so you solved this cus-
           tomer’s problem. What will stop it from happening again? Let your customer
           know that resolving this problem is important to your company. Then let the
           customer know what steps you will take to avoid future situations. Positively
           stating what you will do to fix it will give the customer renewed confidence in
           your company. When someone takes the time to acknowledge that there is a
           problem that can be fixed, it makes the customer feel valued. You send the mes-
           sage that your company truly does care about its customers. Plus, your customer
           will feel he is part of the solution.
               Offer some sort of compensation or restitution. When your company is
           at fault and is the cause of the customer’s problem, give the customer something
           more than is asked for, even if it is only a symbolic gesture. Doing this will not
           make the problem go away, but it will make the customer feel good about you
           and your company.
               Make a follow-up call or visit. As a courtesy to your customer, follow up to
           make sure the solution was satisfactory. Think about this: The customer could
           have taken his business elsewhere without telling you about his dissatisfaction.
           You would have lost a valued customer. By telling you about a problem, the cus-
           tomer is giving you and your company the opportunity to improve.

HOW COULD MIKE HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEM?

   “Mr. Roberts, thanks for being so understanding. I don’t know what hap-
   pened on your first phone call, but I am going to refer this to my manager
   so she can talk to everyone about it. That way, hopefully, we can avoid situ-
   ations like this in the future.”

   Next afternoon:

   “Mr. Roberts, this is Mike from ABC. I wanted to check back with you and
   make sure the service person was out this morning and fixed the problem.”
       “Yes, Mike, she was out first thing and everything is fine now. Thanks
   for calling me back.”

Mike thanked Mr. Roberts for allowing him to fix the problem. He told him what
he was going to do to avoid similar problems in the future. The company was not
clearly at fault, so Mike did not offer any additional compensation or restitution
beyond scheduling the priority appointment. Finally, he made a follow-up call to
make sure Mr. Roberts was satisfied. What do you think Mr. Roberts feels about
his interaction with this company now?




What to Offer as Compensation and Restitution

Discuss appropriate forms of compensation or restitution to offer customers
when your company caused something to go wrong.
    What would be the most effective form of compensation for your business?
Think about your customers. What would be meaningful to them and appropri-
ate for your type of business? Think, too, about which situations deserve an of-
fer of compensation or restitution. Come up with different scenarios and what
you will do. Also discuss who has the authority to approve compensation.

      ll right, now you have satisfactorily taken care of the customer’s problem.
A     But unless you fix what went wrong, the same type of problem is likely to
happen again. Do you want to repeatedly deal with difficult customers on the
same issue?
    Analyze what went wrong. This step is crucial. Sometimes it will not be
easy to analyze what went wrong. In Mike’s case, all he can determine is that a
miscommunication occurred between Mr. Roberts and the previous employee.
Although that is as far as the analyzing will go, something can still be done to fix
a potential problem. Mike or his supervisor can address the issue in a meeting or
by sending a memo to all employees. For example, the manager can ask employ-
ees to verify and clarify all appointments (or lack of) before ending the contacts.
If the first employee had said, “Mr. Roberts, I will make a note that you are going
to call back to schedule your appointment. I do want to let you know that when you
call back there is no guarantee we will still have appointments open for today.” Had
that been said, there would not have been a difficult customer.
    Review your company’s policies and procedures. If you have frequent
customer complaints in one area, it is a good idea to look at your policies and
procedures. Are there some aspects of your business that customers frequently
complain about? It should be your main goal to make it easy for your customers
to do business with your company. When it is easy for customers to do business
with you, it is easier for you to satisfy them. As a customer service employee, you
are in the position to know what makes things difficult for your customers.
    Change what you can to make things better. When you are part of the so-
lution, you will be more satisfied with the work you do. Remember, that you can
make a difference.



            If you cannot easily determine which areas make it difficult for your cus-
            tomers to do business with you, try this. Do a “walk through” of each
step of a customer transaction. Look at your company from a customer’s perspec-
tive. Talk to your manager about the specific ways your company can improve.

           will be confident in your ability to do your best for them.
               The bottom line is that when you deal with customers, there are going to be
           problems. Whether the problem is caused by the customer or by the company,
           what is important in any contact with a difficult customer is what you do to re-
           solve the problem and how valued you make the customer feel.

Have you ever caused a customer to be difficult?

Sharon contacted a company she deals with on a regular basis to place an order.
The representative asked for her account number. After giving it to him, he
promptly told her it was the wrong number. She verified the number she has used
for years. Again, she was told, bluntly, that it was wrong.
    “This is the number I’ve always used,” Sharon assured him.
    “Well,” he responded in a condescending voice, “you must be wrong. All our
account numbers begin with a letter and yours doesn’t.”
    Sharon was not happy with the way she was being treated so she answered in
an equally condescending voice, “This is my account number. In fact, I called last
month and used it.”
    “I don’t know what to tell you,” he again explained, becoming rude as he re-
stated his position. “That isn’t one of our account numbers.”
    His attitude caused Sharon to become a difficult customer. She had been a
customer of this company for years. She was not going to accept this treatment.
She asked for a supervisor. The supervisor she spoke to immediately explained
the problem. The company had recently changed their account numbers. Sharon
was using the old account number, but since she was a long time customer, the
supervisor assured her they could access her account by cross-referencing it in
their system.
    Even if the representative was not aware of the cross-reference procedure, had
he remained courteous to Sharon she would not have become a difficult cus-
tomer. There was no reason for him to handle the contact that way.

  IN ANY CONTACT WITH ANY CUSTOMER, HOW YOU SPEAK AND THE TONE
    YOU USE CAN TURN A PLEASANT CUSTOMER INTO A DIFFICULT ONE—
                               FOR NO REASON.

Y
         ou have covered a lot of ground in this book.
         Part I focused on putting your best face forward.
         You have learned how to present yourself by
using basic courtesies, communicating effectively, and
building strong relationships. Part II focused on putting
your customers first. You learned special skills to handle customers—even diffi-
cult customers—in person, on the telephone, and through the Internet. Now, it
is time to put it all together. You are on your way to giving great customer serv-
ice. Where do you go from here?
     Before proceeding, review your list of learning outcomes. Do you feel confi-
           dent that you can apply the lessons you learned to each item on your
            list? If you are not sure about any of the items, review the relevant
            chapters again. Go back over any sections of the training material
            until you feel comfortable applying the material to your customer sit-
           uations. If you still feel uncomfortable with any of the items, talk them
        over with your manager. To get the most out of this training, it is impor-
        tant that you feel confident with the total package.
     Are you ready to hit the ground running? Not everyone will be ready for that

TRAINING
           be ready to take your first baby steps. If you feel comfortable and confident, go
   101
           ahead and run with this material. But, if you feel a little overwhelmed by all that
           you learned, don’t worry. Begin with baby steps. In fact, even if you are confident
           that you are ready to apply everything you learned, it might be a good idea for
           you to focus on one area at a time so that you can turn each of these lessons into
           lifelong habits.
                Start with the basics. Focus on the way you present yourself when people are
           forming their first impressions of you. Get used to using the courtesy words and
           phrases: please, thank you, excuse me, I’m sorry, yes, and so on. When you find
           yourself using these words without thinking, pay attention to your attitude.
           Remember that your attitude includes how you talk to yourself. Make it a habit
           to use positive words in your self-talk. Make it a habit to always act in an ethical
           manner.
                When you are comfortable with the basics, focus on communicating effec-
           tively. Think before you speak so you will say what you mean and mean what you
           say. Pay attention to the nonverbal messages you send by being aware of your
           body language. You are on your way to presenting yourself well. Next, focus on
           your questioning skills. It may help to write down some sample open and closed
           questions that you will frequently use. Review them often so you will become
           comfortable using them. Remember that no matter what type of question a cus-
           tomer asks you, always try to give more than a one word answer. Give your
           customers more than they ask for. When customers say no, find out the reason
           and do the right thing based on each customer’s needs. Finally, and most impor-
           tantly, listen actively. As your company’s communicator, listening is your most
           important job when you communicate with customers. Unless you listen well,
           you are not going to know exactly what is best for your customers.
                At this point you are ready to form strong relationships with your customers.
           You have learned the nuts and bolts of communicating effectively; now it is time
           to add some pizzazz to your customer contacts. Let your personality shine. Es-
           tablish a rapport by being friendly and interested in your customers so you can
           find common ground. Once you establish a rapport, you will find it easy to in-
           teract positively with your customers. You learned how to develop a comfort level
           with your customers and will be able to help each customer by identifying indi-
           vidual needs. When you do these things, you will make your customers feel valued.
           When customers feel valued, they are more likely to do repeat business with you
                                                                                             193

people from different cultures, and people with disabilities. The most important
thing to remember is to treat all your customers the way you like to be treated.
    Practice each of these steps. Each one is a building block you firmly cement
                  on your customer service foundation. By the time you are com-
                   fortable using all the principles learned in Part I, you have built
                         a strong foundation. The more you use the principles, the
                         more comfortable and confident you will be when you
                         apply them to the various types of customer contacts you
                       learned in Part II.
    Review these steps frequently. It is easy to forget or fall back into old habits.
Make a conscious effort to practice these principles every day. Practice using them,
not only at work, but also in your interactions with family and friends. Practice
using them in situations in which you are the customer. Learning how to com-
municate well will help you build positive relationships in all areas of your life.
    Refer to the list on the next page frequently to make sure you remember to
follow all the lessons you learned.

        thing to cover. You read an entire book devoted
        to helping you give exceptional customer serv-
ice. This last chapter is devoted to you—only you—to
help you be the best you can be in everything you do.
    When you focus on being the best person you can be every day, good things
will happen to you. People will notice. You may get that promotion for which
                           you have been hoping. You may get that award for out-
                           standing performance. Even if you do not reap external
                           rewards, internally you will feel good about yourself.
                           You will find increased job satisfaction when you give
                           your best.
    Be your best in everything you do, and you will find that you perform better
at work, that you give more of yourself to other people, and that you get more
happiness and satisfaction in everything you do.
    How do you begin being your best?
    Take responsibility for your actions. Remember, there is only one person in
charge of you. You are in charge of you. You control your actions. You control
your performance at work. You control your behavior. You make the decisions

           those feelings outward.
                Be the person you want to be. Create in your mind a positive vision of the
           person you want to become. If you have trouble seeing clearly, take time alone
           to focus on the qualities you want to personify and to envision the “you” you want
           to be. Keep this vision in your conscious. Change your self-talk to reflect the
           new you. If your vision is to be more confident and self-assured, act the part. Tell
           yourself that you are confident and self-assured. Initially it will be difficult and
           awkward but the more you practice the easier it will become until one day your
           confident behavior will be second nature and you will no longer be acting.
                Set goals for yourself. What will it take for you to become the person you
           envision yourself being? Do you need to go back to school? Do you need to join
           an organization that fosters the qualities you wish to exemplify? Write down spe-
           cific goals. There is something magical about writing your goals on paper. Once
           they are written, you will become more focused on finding ways to achieve them.
           If some of your goals are too big or long range, break them into smaller, more
           manageable goals.
                Keep looking forward. It is easy to get mired in the day-to-day grind. It is
           also easy to get mired in dwelling on the past. When you keep looking forward,
           it is easier to continue focusing on your goals. Here is where your self-talk is im-
           portant. You cannot change what happened, but the next time you can do things
           differently. Change your self-talk to words that will help you move toward your
           goals. Learn to respect yourself by being respectful of the way you talk to yourself.
                Measure your own level of performance. Periodically, answer these ques-
           tions. Do you feel good, both physically and mentally? Are you happy, both in
           your job and in your life? Do you look forward to each day, going to work and
           doing other activities? Are you proud of your efforts? If you answered yes, you
           are most likely performing well at work and working towards achieving your
           goals. If you answered no, it is time for self-reflection. Look inward to figure out
           what is happening and how you can improve yourself and your situation. This
           might mean rethinking your goals. It may be time to create a more realistic vision
           of your future so you can set goals that are reachable.
                Keep striving. To be your best means to keep striving to be even better. Learn
           the skills of your job well. Ask questions to learn more. Try to learn something

need help. Try to anticipate problems before they get out of hand. Be part of the
solution, rather than part of the problem. Give your all in everything you do. Take
the extra step for your customers, your family, and your friends.
     Be a good listener. This theme has been stressed throughout the book, but
it cannot be stressed enough. Listening completely is important, not only in work
situations, but in every life situation. A good listener equates to a good commu-
nicator. When you listen well you become well informed. You learn more. You
tune in to others. Learn to listen more than you speak. Speak when you have some-
thing meaningful—and constructive—to say. Remember always to think before
you speak.
     Enjoy and have fun. Being the best you can be has a positive reward: You
begin enjoying everything you do. Be positive. Find the good in others. When you
encounter someone who is difficult to deal with, whether it is your customer,
friend, or significant other, do whatever you can to make that person’s day bet-
ter. When you encounter someone who needs help, feel happy that you can help.
When you encounter a stranger, smile. Be grateful that you have this day. Be
appreciative of those around you. Laugh often. Be happy. Make it a goal to have
fun every day.

                             ALWAYS BE YOUR BEST!
