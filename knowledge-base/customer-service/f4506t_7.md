         transcript information for up to 10 years. Information for the current year is generally not available until the year after it is filed with the IRS. For
         example, W-2 information for 2016, filed in 2017, will likely not be available from the IRS until 2018. If you need W-2 information for retirement
         purposes, you should contact the Social Security Administration at 1-800-772-1213. Most requests will be processed within 10 business days .
