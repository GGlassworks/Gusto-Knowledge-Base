                         STUDY


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The 2018-19 AASA Superintendent Salary & Benefits Study marks the seventh edition
of this study, employing a revised survey instrument. This survey tracks the
demographics, salary, benefits and other elements of the employment contracts of
school superintendents throughout the country. This year’s study is based on 1,433
responses (approximately a 14 percent response rate). The survey was distributed
online and relied on superintendents responding to 51 items with the understanding
that the report of findings would contain no personally identifiable information.
Consequently, data must be considered descriptive and not necessarily representative
of all superintendents. However, the report is rich with information and serves as a
useful snapshot of the salary and benefits of superintendents for the 2018-19 school
year. For a more detailed examination of the superintendency, The Study of the American
Superintendent: 2015 Mid-Decade Update and its 2010 predecessor are available on the
AASA website:
http://www.aasa.org/pages/templates/gsesearch.aspx?q=The20study20of20the20Am
erican20Superintendent
In addition, state-specific model superintendent employment agreements are also
available on the AASA website:
http://my.aasa.org/AASA/Toolbox/Other_Resources/Model_Contracts.aspx

This year, as in the past five years, more than 90 percent of respondents reported that
they served in suburban and rural districts with 70 percent of respondents self-reported
serving in rural districts. This is generally representative of the distribution of school
districts nationwide.

Consistent with findings of the previous years, male respondents outnumbered females
by slightly less than a four-to-one ratio. Respondents are also overwhelmingly white
(not Hispanic). Female respondents also tended to be somewhat older than their male
counterparts. The average and median age of all respondents is 52.

The median base salary distributed by district enrollment ranged from $96,750/$94,000
(male/female) for the smallest districts to $260,000/$259,892 (male/female) for
superintendents serving in the largest enrollment school districts. All positions, from
superintendent to teacher, show that salaries increase relative to district enrollment size
as well as slight increases over previous years.

INTRODUCTION

The 2018-19 AASA Superintendents Salary and Benefits Study is intended to provide
superintendents with actionable information needed to manage and negotiate their
compensation and benefits. This edition marks the sixth year the association has
undertaken a comprehensive study on public school superintendent compensation
benefits, employing a revised survey instrument. Prior to that, most school
superintendents relied on the annual salary study sponsored by the Education Research
Service (ERS) to benchmark their compensation and benefits. With the closure of ERS, a
void was created. AASA responded to this need by developing a comprehensive study
of the salary and benefits of school superintendents that far exceeded previous studies
undertaken on this topic. AASA is particularly well suited for this task because it
represents the vast majority of school superintendents in the country and has been most
active in collecting and disseminating to its members critical data needed to inform
decision making. AASA is committed to refining this work over time, thus maximizing
the benefit to superintendents.

The earlier editions of this study are available on the AASA website and provide
valuable retrospective data (http://www.aasa.org/research.aspx).

This work complements The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study
(Kowalski et al. 2010), also sponsored by AASA, and available from Roman & Littlefield
(https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781607099963). This study was updated in 2015 and is
available on the AASA website (http://www.aasa.org/research.aspx).

In addition, there is an inevitable comparison between public and private sector COE’s.
Useful in this discussion is the work of The New York Times in its ongoing series on
private sector CEO compensation and its relationship to median employee pay
(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/business/highest-paid-ceos-2017.html).

Leslie A. Finnan, AASA senior legislative analyst, led the research team authoring this
report of findings, with assistance from Robert S. McCord, AASA research consultant.
The research was conducted under the direct supervision of Noelle Ellerson Ng, AASA
associate executive director, policy and advocacy.

METHODOLOGY

An extensive survey instrument was developed in 2012 with the assistance of Professors
Theodore J. Kowalski (University of Dayton), I. Phillip Young (University of South
Carolina), Terry Orr (Bank Street College) and Christopher C. Stream (University of
Nevada, Las Vegas). This survey instrument was further refined for use in each
subsequent year as a result of input received. Using a commercially prepared mailing
list of American public-school superintendents, more than 9,000 email invitations to
participate were distributed during the month of September 2018. At the same time,

                                                                                Page | 3
state association executive directors were contacted to encourage their members to
respond to the online survey. Superintendents had the capacity to forward the link to
their staff members for input in completing the survey in their area of expertise.

REPORT OF FINDINGS

This report of findings is divided into 11 sections and relies solely on measures of
central tendency for this analysis of the data collected. These data are generally
disaggregated by gender, district enrollment and racial/ethnic group.

As with any ambitious effort of this sort, there are limitations on the proper use of the
data. For example, when the responses for certain items are disaggregated by
racial/ethnic group, the number of responses is insufficient to support decision making.
Care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences on this data element. In
addition, some survey fatigue is commonly reported by superintendents and could
have impacted the return rate. Superintendents are inundated with research requests
resulting in selective participation in those studies seen as most important to the role of
the superintendent or of benefit to their district. After each data display, the report
authors have offered a general statement of findings. It is the intent of the authors to
allow the readers the opportunity to disaggregate the data in a manner they find useful
in working with their board.

Having clearly identified the limitations inherent in any endeavor of this sort, the report
that follows is replete with important information that can prove very useful to
superintendents.

Findings:
   • A total of 1,433 usable responses were received, representing an approximately 14 percent
       return rate. This return represents an increase from that received in 2017-18 response
       (N=1,172) and 2016-17 (N=1,392). Demographics of the respondents have changed very little
       over the years.
   • All 50 states are represented.

Findings:
   • Similar to previous studies, male respondents outnumbered females by slightly less than a
       four-to-one ratio. Over the past five editions of this study, we have seen a slow but consistent
       growth in female superintendents responding.
   • Respondents are overwhelmingly white (not Hispanic) accounting for 89.9 percent of the
       respondents while 93.3 percent of the respondents in 2017-18 self-reported white (not
       Hispanic).
   • The small number of minority superintendent respondents make definitive findings for those
       groups difficult.

Finding:
   • Consistent with nationwide school district enrollment data, the majority of superintendents
       responding to the survey are from intermediate size districts (300-2,499 students) with no
       recent appreciable difference by gender of superintendents serving in each enrollment band.

Finding:
     • When asked to describe the setting of their district, 65 percent of the respondents, regardless
         of gender, indicated that their district is best described as rural while about a quarter
         describe their district as suburban. This is closely aligned with data from the National
         Center on Education Statistics.

Finding:

   •    Consistent with earlier versions of the study, the mean and median age for female
        superintendents is greater than their male counterparts. This supports the findings of other
        AASA studies on the superintendency where females tend to enter the role later
        and have more experience in classroom teaching and other education positions.

Finding:
   • More than half of respondents have served in their present position for between one and five
       years, with less than 15 percent topping 10 years. This finding is consistent with previous
       findings.

Finding:
   • Males report somewhat longer longevity in the superintendency than females, although the
       longevity of female superintendents has increased substantially over the previous years of
       this study and The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study.

Findings:
   • In 2013, 49.6 percent of the respondents described their districts as economically stable while
      43.1 percent of respondents described their districts as in declining economic condition. Since
      then, district economic conditions have improved steadily, albeit not dramatically.
   • Female superintendents are consistently less optimistic about the economic stability of their
      district. This trend has been consistent in recent years.

 Finding:
    • As in the previously reported, white (not Hispanic) superintendents represent the vast
       majority of superintendents responding to the study regardless of district size, which is
       consistent with the findings of The American School Superintendent: 2010 Decennial Study as well
       as findings from the 2013-2018 salary studies. Note: As indicated in the introduction, care
       should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences from the very small numbers of
       respondents in some of the racial/cultural groups, other than the fact that white (not
       Hispanic) superintendents are the largest group represented in the study and minorities
       appear to be underrepresented in the superintendent ranks, especially when compared to the
       racial/cultural profile of American public school enrollment.

Finding:
   • Considering the small representation of some racial/cultural group respondents, it is difficult
      to draw conclusions from these data, although the absence of diversity in urban districts again
      represents an anomaly when one considers the diversity of the student population generally
      understood to be enrolled in urban districts.

Finding:
   • When the number of respondents is considered, not a great variation was found between the
      mean or median age of those responding when disaggregated by racial/cultural group. This is
      consistent with previous editions of this study.

 Findings:
    • As reported in Table 1.6, half of superintendents have served in their present position from 1-
        5 years. A quarter of superintendents have served from 6-10 years.
    • The number of racial/cultural group respondents is too small to identify any trends.

Finding:
           •   While the numbers are too small for most racial/cultural groups to draw definitive
               conclusions, there is some limited evidence that minority superintendents have served
               longer in the superintendency than white (not Hispanic) superintendents.

Finding:
    • Except for Black or African American superintendents, about half of respondents indicated
        that their district is in stable condition. Over one fourth of districts are reported to be in
        declining economic conditions, which represent a small improvement over previous
        findings. Again, care should be taken with over interpreting the data due to the limited
        number of minority superintendents responding to the survey.

                                        SECTION #2: SALARY

   NOTE: A significant amount of information follows concerning salaries paid to the superintendents
   and their staff. For the purposes of comparisons, ratios have been calculated for median
   superintendent salaries and that of teachers (see Table 2.3). The logic employed is that in the private
   sector, a commonly used metric (ratio) is calculated based on the base salary of the CEO and that of
   the entry-level worker in the organization. Without great difficulty, other metrics can be calculated
   using these data presented herein.

 Findings:
    •    Consistent with previous years, salaries increase as district enrollment increases.
    •    There is little discernable difference between genders in reported salaries.

Findings:
   • Consistent with findings in previous editions of the study, the larger the student enrollment
       of the district the higher the mean base salary for assistant/associate superintendents. It is
       noted that in the smallest of districts, these positions often do not exist.
   • A modest but consistent increase in median salaries is seen over previous editions of this
       study.

       principals.

Finding:
   • Elementary school principals generally follow the same trend as their high school and middle
       school counterparts, although for the first time, their 2017 median base salary in the largest
       districts has crossed the $100,000 line. This trend continued in the 2018 study.

Finding:
   • As mentioned above, a metric of growing importance in the private sector is the ratio of the
       entry-level worker compensation with the base salary (without incentives) of the CEO.
       Accordingly, the median entry-level salary of teachers is presented compared with the
       median salary of the superintendents arrayed by district size. The data confirms that as the
       district enrollment increases so does the ratio. In addition, the ratio has appeared to generally
       widen over the past four survey periods, regardless of the district enrollment.

Finding:
       •    Slightly less than 4 in 10 respondents indicated they receive a district contribution to an annuity or

Finding:
       •    In a new item to this survey, respondents were as asked about the percentage of the total
            retirement contribution paid by the district. The responses, as anticipated, varied greatly,
            suggesting additional data on this topic must be collected in future surveys.

       the 2012-13 study, 17.6 percent of the respondents reported having post-retirement health
       coverage in their employment agreement. This has risen significantly over the years to nearly
       30 percent this year. The impact of Medicare participation is not included in the survey.

       approximately one in three superintendents have included this provision in their employment
       agreement.

Finding:
   • The presence of incentive/performance clauses appear in slightly more than one in ten

Finding:
   • Where sufficient number of respondents exists, slightly more than one in five of respondents
       in each racial/cultural group had a severance provision that represents small increase from
       the previous year survey.

Finding:

    •   Indemnification and hold harmless provisions demonstrate little variation over racial/cultural
        group when respondent counts are sufficient. Four out of ten superintendents include the
        provision with another two out of ten claiming that state law protects them.
