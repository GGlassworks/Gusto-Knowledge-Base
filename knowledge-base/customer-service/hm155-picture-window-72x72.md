7.0 Test Results: (Continued)

    Note 1: The tested specimen meets (or exceeds) the performance levels specified in
    AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S.2/A440 for air leakage resistance.

    Note 2: The client opted to start at a pressure higher than the minimum required. Test
    results are reported under Optional Performance.

    Note 3: The deflections reported are not limited by AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S.2/A440 for
    this product designation. The deflection data is recorded in this report for special code
    compliance and information only.

    Note 4: Loads were held for 10 seconds.

    Note 5: Tape and film were used to seal against air leakage during structural testing. In
    our opinion, the tape and film did not influence the results of the test.
