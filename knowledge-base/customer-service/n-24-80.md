2025 Amounts Relating to Retirement Plans and IRAs, as Adjusted for Changes in
Cost-of-Living



Notice 2024-80

       Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (“Code”) provides for limitations on
benefits and contributions under qualified retirement plans. Section 415(d) requires that
the Secretary of the Treasury annually adjust these limitations for cost-of-living
increases. Under section 415(d), the adjustments are to be made under adjustment
procedures similar to those used to adjust benefit amounts under section 215(i)(2)(A) of
the Social Security Act. Other amounts applicable to deferred compensation plans are
also adjusted for cost-of-living increases using a variation of the methodology used for
the adjustments under section 415(d).

Cost-of-Living Adjusted Limitations for 2025

       Effective January 1, 2025, the limitation on the annual benefit under a defined
benefit plan under section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Code is increased from $275,000 to
$280,000.

        For a participant who separated from service before January 1, 2025, the
participant’s limitation under a defined benefit plan under section 415(b)(1)(B) is
computed by multiplying the participant’s compensation limitation, as adjusted through
2024, by 1.0262.

       The limitation for defined contribution plans under section 415(c)(1)(A) is
increased in 2025 from $69,000 to $70,000.

      The Code provides that various other amounts are to be adjusted at the same
time and in the same manner as the limitation of section 415(b)(1)(A). After taking into
account the applicable rounding rules, the amounts for 2025 are as follows:

       The limitation under section 402(g)(1) on the exclusion for elective deferrals
       described in section 402(g)(3), which includes elective deferrals made to the
       Thrift Savings Plan, is increased from $23,000 to $23,500.

       The limitation on deferrals under section 457(e)(15) concerning deferred
       compensation plans of state and local governments and tax-exempt
       organizations is increased from $23,000 to $23,500.

       The limitation under section 414(v)(2)(B)(i) for catch-up contributions to an
       applicable employer plan other than a plan described in section 401(k)(11) or
       section 408(p) that generally applies for individuals aged 50 or over remains
       $7,500. The limitation under section 414(v)(2)(E)(i) for catch-up contributions to
       an applicable employer plan other than a plan described in section 401(k)(11) or
       section 408(p) that applies for individuals who attain age 60, 61, 62, or 63 in

                                             1
2025 is $11,250. The Roth catch-up wage threshold for 2024, which under
section 414(v)(7)(A) is used to determine whether an individual’s catch-up
contributions to an applicable employer plan (other than a plan described in
section 408(k) or (p)) for 2025 must be designated Roth contributions, remains
$145,000.

The limitation under section 408(p)(2)(E)(i)(III) that generally applies to salary
reduction contributions under a SIMPLE retirement account or elective
contributions under a SIMPLE 401(k) plan is increased from $16,000 to $16,500.
The limitation for certain of those accounts or plans under
section 408(p)(2)(E)(i)(I) or (II) remains $17,600.

The limitation under section 414(v)(2)(B)(ii) for catch-up contributions to an
applicable employer plan described in section 401(k)(11) or section 408(p) that
generally applies for individuals aged 50 or over remains $3,500. The limitation
under section 414(v)(2)(E)(ii) for catch-up contributions to an applicable employer
plan described in section 401(k)(11) or section 408(p) that applies for individuals
who attain age 60, 61, 62, or 63 in 2025 is $5,250. The limitation under
section 414(v)(2)(B)(iii) for catch-up contributions to certain accounts or plans
described in section 401(k)(11) or section 408(p) that generally applies for
individuals aged 50 or over remains $3,850.

The limitation under section 401(k)(16)(D)(i)(II) and 403(b)(16)(D)(i)(II) that
generally applies for elective contributions made to a starter 401(k) deferral-only
arrangement described in section 401(k)(16)(B) or a safe harbor deferral-only
plan described in section 403(b)(16)(B), respectively, remains $6,000. This
limitation is increased for individuals who attain age 50 before the end of the
taxable year by $1,000.

The threshold used in the definition of “highly compensated employee” under
section 414(q)(1)(B) is increased from $155,000 to $160,000.

The threshold under section 416(i)(1)(A)(i) concerning the definition of “key
employee” for top-heavy plan purposes is increased from $220,000 to $230,000.

The annual compensation limitation under sections 401(a)(17), 404(l),
408(k)(3)(C), and 408(k)(6)(D)(ii) is increased from $345,000 to $350,000. The
annual compensation limitation under section 401(a)(17) for eligible participants
in certain governmental plans that, under the plan as in effect on July 1, 1993,
allowed cost-of-living adjustments to the compensation limitation under the plan
under section 401(a)(17) to be taken into account, is increased from $505,000 to
$520,000.

The limitation under section 402A(e)(3)(A)(i) concerning pension-linked
emergency savings accounts that may be included in certain types of defined
contribution plans remains $2,500.



                                      2
       The compensation threshold under section 408(k)(2)(C) regarding simplified
       employee pensions remains $750.

       The amount under section 409(o)(1)(C)(ii) for determining the maximum account
       balance in an employee stock ownership plan subject to a 5-year distribution
       period is increased from $1,380,000 to $1,415,000, while the dollar amount used
       to determine the lengthening of the 5-year distribution period is increased from
       $275,000 to $280,000.

       The limitation on the aggregate amount of length of service awards accruing with
       respect to any year of service for any bona fide volunteer under
       section 457(e)(11)(B)(ii) concerning deferred compensation plans of state and
       local governments and tax-exempt organizations remains $7,500.

       The limitation under section 664(g)(7) concerning the qualified gratuitous transfer
       of qualified employer securities to an employee stock ownership plan remains
       $60,000.

       The compensation amount under § 1.61-21(f)(5)(i) of the Income Tax
       Regulations concerning the definition of “control employee” for fringe benefit
       valuation purposes is increased from $135,000 to $140,000. The compensation
       amount under § 1.61-21(f)(5)(iii) is increased from $275,000 to $285,000.

       The limitation on premiums paid for a qualifying longevity annuity contract under
       § 1.401(a)(9)-6(q)(2)(ii) is increased from $200,000 to $210,000.

       The $1,000,000,000 threshold used to determine whether a multiemployer plan is
a systemically important plan under section 432(e)(9)(H)(v)(III)(aa) is adjusted using the
cost-of-living adjustment provided under section 432(e)(9)(H)(v)(III)(bb). After taking the
applicable rounding rule into account, the threshold used to determine whether a
multiemployer plan is a systemically important plan under
section 432(e)(9)(H)(v)(III)(aa) is increased from $1,369,000,000 to $1,441,000,000.

       The Code also provides that several retirement-related amounts are to be
adjusted using a variation of the methodology used for the cost-of-living adjustments
under section 1(f)(3). After taking the applicable rounding rules into account, the
amounts for 2025 are as follows:

       The adjusted gross income limitation under section 25B(b)(1)(A) for determining
       the retirement savings contributions credit for married taxpayers filing a joint
       return is increased from $46,000 to $47,500; the limitation under
       section 25B(b)(1)(B) is increased from $50,000 to $51,000; and the limitation
       under sections 25B(b)(1)(C) and 25B(b)(1)(D) is increased from $76,500 to
       $79,000.

       The adjusted gross income limitation under section 25B(b)(1)(A) for determining
       the retirement savings contributions credit for taxpayers filing as head of
       household is increased from $34,500 to $35,625; the limitation under

                                            3
section 25B(b)(1)(B) is increased from $37,500 to $38,250; and the limitation
under sections 25B(b)(1)(C) and 25B(b)(1)(D) is increased from $57,375 to
$59,250.

The adjusted gross income limitation under section 25B(b)(1)(A) for determining
the retirement savings contributions credit for all other taxpayers is increased
from $23,000 to $23,750; the limitation under section 25B(b)(1)(B) is increased
from $25,000 to $25,500; and the limitation under sections 25B(b)(1)(C) and
25B(b)(1)(D) is increased from $38,250 to $39,500.

The deductible amount under section 219(b)(5)(A), which limits the amount of an
individual’s deductible qualified retirement contributions for a taxable year
remains $7,000. The increase in the deductible amount pursuant to section
219(b)(5)(B)(ii) for individuals who have attained age 50 before the close of the
taxable year remains $1,000.

The applicable amount under section 219(g)(3)(B)(i) for determining the
deductible amount of an IRA contribution for taxpayers who are active
participants filing a joint return or as a qualifying widow(er) is increased from
$123,000 to $126,000. The applicable amount under section 219(g)(3)(B)(ii) for
all other taxpayers who are active participants (other than married taxpayers
filing separate returns) is increased from $77,000 to $79,000. If an individual or
the individual’s spouse is an active participant, the applicable amount under
section 219(g)(3)(B)(iii) for a married individual filing a separate return is not
subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $0. The applicable
amount under section 219(g)(7)(A) for a taxpayer who is not an active participant
but whose spouse is an active participant is increased from $230,000 to
$236,000.

In light of the changes to the applicable amounts, under section 219(g)(2)(A), the
deduction for taxpayers making contributions to a traditional IRA is phased out
for single individuals and heads of household who are active participants in a
qualified plan (or another retirement plan specified in section 219(g)(5)) and have
adjusted gross incomes (as defined in section 219(g)(3)(A)) between $79,000
and $89,000, increased from between $77,000 and $87,000. For married couples
filing jointly, if the spouse who makes the IRA contribution is an active participant,
the income phase-out range is between $126,000 and $146,000, increased from
between $123,000 and $143,000. For an IRA contributor who is not an active
participant and is married to someone who is an active participant, the deduction
is phased out if the couple’s income is between $236,000 and $246,000,
increased from between $230,000 and $240,000. For a married individual filing a
separate return who is an active participant, the phase-out range is not subject to
an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $0 to $10,000.

The adjusted gross income limitation under section 408A(c)(3)(B)(ii)(I) for
determining the maximum Roth IRA contribution for married taxpayers filing a
joint return or for taxpayers filing as a qualifying widow(er) is increased from

                                      4
        $230,000 to $236,000. The adjusted gross income limitation under
        section 408A(c)(3)(B)(ii)(II) for all other taxpayers (other than married taxpayers
        filing separate returns) is increased from $146,000 to $150,000. The applicable
        amount under section 408A(c)(3)(B)(ii)(III) for a married individual filing a
        separate return is not subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains
        $0.

        In light of the changes to the adjusted gross income limitations, under section
        408A(c)(3)(A), the adjusted gross income phase-out range for taxpayers making
        contributions to a Roth IRA is between $236,000 and $246,000 for married
        couples filing jointly, increased from between $230,000 and $240,000. For
        singles and heads of household, the income phase-out range is between
        $150,000 and $165,000, increased from between $146,000 and $161,000. For a
        married individual filing a separate return, the phase-out range is not subject to
        an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains between $0 and $10,000.

        The aggregate amount of qualified charitable distributions that are not includible
        in gross income under section 408(d)(8)(A) is increased from $105,000 to
        $108,000. The amount of qualified charitable distributions made directly to a split-
        interest entity that are not includible in gross income under section
        408(d)(8)(F)(i)(II) pursuant to a one-time election is increased from $53,000 to
        $54,000.

        The annual compensation limitation under section 45E(f)(2)(C) for employees
        excluded from the calculation of the additional small employer pension plan
        startup cost credit for certain employer contributions is $105,000. 1

        The limitation under section 72(t)(2)(K)(ii)(I) for eligible distributions to victims of
        domestic abuse from applicable eligible retirement plans is increased from
        $10,000 to $10,300.

        The limitation under section 401(a)(39)(B)(i)(III) on a qualified long-term care
        distribution from a qualified defined contribution plan with respect to certified
        long-term care insurance applicable for distributions made after December 29,
        2025, is $2,600.

        The limitation under section 408(p)(2)(A)(iv) for additional nonelective
        contributions for an employee to a SIMPLE retirement account or a SIMPLE
        401(k) plan is increased from $5,000 to $5,100.

  Pursuant to section 45E(f)(2)(C)(iii), for a taxable year beginning in a calendar year after 2023, this
limitation is equal to the initial limitation of $100,000, multiplied by the cost-of-living adjustment
determined under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins, determined by
substituting “calendar year 2007” for “calendar year 2016” in section 1(f)(3)(A)(ii). Because the
specification of a 2007 base period to be used for computing an adjustment that is first made for 2024
appears to be an error that has been identified as the subject of future legislative correction, the IRS will
calculate and apply the limitation in section 45E(f)(2)(C) by substituting “calendar year 2022” for “calendar
year 2007” in section 45E(f)(2)(C)(iii). Using that substitution, the limitation for 2024 was $105,000.

                                                     5
