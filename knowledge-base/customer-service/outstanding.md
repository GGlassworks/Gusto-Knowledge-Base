Introduction
“Sales are down. We’re just not getting repeat business. We have to improve our customer
service!”

If you’ve ever worked with customers, you know how vitally important outstanding
customer service can be in building customer loyalty. And you probably also know




    LE
that improving customer service is more complex than most people realize. For
example, suppose an organization wants to help its employees improve their telephone
customer service skills. The employees attend a course in which they develop their
telephone communication. But when they return to work, they find that because of
the long delay customers have before they talk with them, the customers are upset and
even abusive. What is the problem?

Outstanding customer service means more than developing good communication
skills, though these skills are very important. In order for an organization to provide
outstanding customer service, it must develop customer service systems that support and
reinforce customer service skills. Customer service systems include hiring, training,
  MP
rewards, call servicing, repair support, and order processing, to name just a few. The
best telephone skills in the world will not be able to completely overcome a faulty call
system that requires customers to wait an unreasonable length of time before they talk
to someone who can help them.

This book focuses on customer service representatives, the skills they must develop,
and the systems within which they must work. Our ongoing theme is the basic
philosophy “We care about our customers.” I see this slogan and others like it
plastered all over the walls of some organizations—maybe you have too. I’m sure
these signs are well-meaning, but they miss the point. Words and advertising will not
convince customers that you really care about them—actions and behaviors will. If
you care about your customers, show them. As the saying goes, “Customers go where
they are wanted and stay where they are appreciated.”
SA

Many of you reading this book may have little direct control over the customer service
systems you use. You probably do, however, have some influence over these systems
or at least over the people who work in those areas. To help improve systems, I have
included a section on auditing and continuous improvement that will help you
evaluate your role in the customer service system. You may even begin to influence
others to look at what they are doing too.

Assessing Your Current Customer Service Situation
How to Get the Most from This Book

This book is designed to help you improve your customer service skills and the
environment in which these skills are used. To get the most from this book, think




    LE
about the ways in which you interact with customers. We call these customer service
behaviors or actions. In addition, think of the environment you and your company
create for the customer encounter or interaction. It also has an influence on the
customer’s perception of you and your company. Ask yourself which behaviors you
are doing well. Recognize your strengths and continue to develop and improve them.
Ask yourself which behaviors need to change. Below is a self-assessment instrument
to evaluate your current customer service skills and your customer environment.

Customer Service Self-Assessment
This self-assessment will help you measure your current customer service skills and
the customer environment. You are given five choices from which to pick. For each
  MP
statement, circle the appropriate response that corresponds with how you see yourself
and your customer service environment. The five choices are Never (1); Rarely (2);
Sometimes (3); Usually (4); and Always (5).

How Did You Score?
If you answered most of the questions as Always or Usually, your perception of your
skills and the customer service environment are effectively developed. You are to be
commended. However, don’t get too “puffed up” at this point. When we rate
ourselves, most of us tend to rate ourselves higher than others would rate us. The acid
test is how your internal and external customers rate your skills and customer service
environment. As you read through the book, identify some ways to make what is
already a good customer service approach even better. If you are not constantly
improving customer service, keep in mind that your competitor is.

Review areas that you rated Sometimes, Rarely, and Never. These are areas you
perceive as weaknesses in your customer service approach. As you read this book,
pay particular attention in these areas.

Who Are Customers?
We will start by defining a very basic term—customers.
Customers are people who have a specific need or desire that

they believe can be satisfied by your product or service.
Customers can be either internal or external. We most often                           1
associate the word customer with external customers. External
customers in both for-profit and not-for-profit organizations are
people outside the organization who benefit from that
organization’s product or service.

Internal customers differ from external customers because they
do not necessarily derive direct benefit from the organization’s
products or services. Internal customers are people within the      Customers are

           Who Are Customer Service
           Representatives?




    LE
           We have been using the term customer service representatives, but
           who are they? When we hear the term customer service
           representative, we generally think of employees with that title or
           one similar. While it is true that they have more contact with
           the customer than most employees, all employees within an
           organization have some impact on customer service. For
           example, a shipping clerk impacts customers by filling orders
           promptly, and an accountant impacts customers by preparing
           invoices accurately.

           For some employees, contact with a customer may be casual,
  MP       yet it is still important. Consider the customer waiting in a
           company’s lobby. An employee walks by but fails to speak to
           the customer. That employee has probably just sent a negative
           message, especially if the employee’s body language makes him
           or her appear hurried or irritated. At a minimum, that employee
           has passed up an opportunity to make a positive impression on
           this customer.

           As you can see from these examples, while some employees
           have a great deal of interaction with customers, everyone has a
           responsibility for projecting a “we care” attitude. Remember,
           all employees project one of three attitudes to the customer:
           negative, neutral, or positive. None of us want to project a
           negative attitude, and we generally get feedback when we do
SA

           exhibit this attitude. Projecting a neutral attitude can be as
           damaging to customer relationships as projecting a negative
           attitude. In today’s highly competitive world, we must adapt,
           develop, and project a positive attitude toward customers.
           Customers must walk away thinking, “They really do care
           about me.” Organizations must develop, reinforce, and
           reward behaviors that reflect positive customer service attitudes.

The fundamental reason customer satisfaction is important to
your organization is because it allows your organization to stay
in business. In many businesses, service is the only thing that
makes your organization more attractive than your competitors’.
                                                                   15

           Customer satisfaction is also important to you on a personal
           level. Using your customer service skills to satisfy your
           customers will lower your stress level and help you avoid job




    LE
           burnout. For example, calming an irritated customer allows
           you to focus your energy on solving the problem rather than
           arguing or dealing with your own frayed emotions.

           You can derive a sense of satisfaction when you solve a
           customer’s problem. Most customers appreciate your help and
           will tell you so. No matter whether you are selling to a happy
           customer or dealing with a dissatisfied customer, you have the
           opportunity to help solve a problem.

When customers decide to buy and use your product or service,
they make that decision based on their perception of how that
product or service will meet their expectations. This is Perceived
Value (PV). There are three components of perceived value—           There are three
Quality, Customer Service, and Cost. The relationship of these       components of
three components can be expressed in an algebraic formula:           perceived
                                                                     value—Quality,
                                                                     Customer

  Perceived Value = Quality + Customer Service - Cost                Service, and
                                                                     Cost.

You may produce a product, such as parts, paint, food, cars,
lawn mowers, lipstick, or paper. Or you may provide a service,
such as plumbing, accounting, house painting, computer repair,
consulting, or nursing. Whether you produce a product or
service, your output has characteristics and features that the
customer desires or needs. These characteristics and features
define the quality component. The customer service component of
the PV formula is defined as any helpful act performed for the
customer that enhances the quality of the product or service.
Toll-free numbers, customer calling centers, knowledgeable sales
representatives, volume discounting, and customer follow-up are
SA

just a few examples of customer service.

According to the Perceived Value concept, if our customers
perceive our quality and customer service higher and our price
lower than our competitors’, chances are they will buy from us.
Remember, we are talking about the customer’s definition of
quality, service, and cost, not our own. Each customer can
have a different definition of each of these components and
may focus on one more than another. For example, a person
with an income of $75,000 may place less emphasis on cost
and more on the other components of quality and customer
service than a person with an income of $35,000. The person
with the higher income might shop at a full-service clothing
store, while the person with the lower income might prefer a
discount clothing store.                                                         17

           As we mentioned earlier, according to a national survey, 67

           customer service than quality or cost.

           ■ Bill’s high school was having a Career Week, and Bill was

              “I do a lot of things,” Mary responded, “but mostly I just make
  MP          sure the customer is happy.”

           Is this an adequate description of Mary’s responsibilities? Often,

   customer is really abusive, I tell myself that everyone has a

   as possible.”

Good customer service starts with a positive attitude—your                                1
positive attitude. An attitude is a person’s feelings toward a given
set of circumstances. These feelings may be positive or negative.

Both you and your customers begin each customer encounter
with an attitude. These attitudes will affect the actions and
behaviors each of you exhibit. You have little control over the
customer’s attitude. You can, however, control your attitude.

take control of your attitude and turn a negative day into a

                Developing Customer Service Standards
                Customers see your positive attitude reflected in your behaviors.
                A behavior is something other people can see you do. It is action

                attitude, believing that everyone knows the expected behaviors.

                   Building Your Product or Service
                   Knowledge
                   Can you answer basic questions about your organization’s
                   products and services? Most customers expect you to have some
                   knowledge of the products and/or services you provide. The old
                   saying “knowledge is power” is true. Remember the customer’s
                   Perceived Value and its components of quality, service, and cost.
                   Knowledge of your products and services allows you to discuss
                   the various characteristics that set you apart from the
                   competition. In other words, you have an opportunity to

When you describe a product or service to a customer, you may
be tempted to stop with a list of features, as in this example:




    LE
■ These running shoes have a new patented insole system. The
  treads on the outer sole are designed to provide extra traction
  and the upper part of the shoe is waterproof and stain

  resistant.

The features in the example are certainly impressive. But
remember, customers come to you because they are trying to
fulfill a need or desire. They are interested in how a product or
service’s features can help them meet that need or desire—how
those features will benefit them. When you talk about features
in terms of the benefits they provide, you show customers how
your product or service can meet their needs, as in this example:
  MP
■ You mentioned that you’d been having some foot problems
  lately. These shoes have a new type of insole that can reduce
  the impact that causes that type of problem.


   Take a Moment
   If a customer were to ask you what the important features of
   your product or service are, what would you tell them? Pick
   a specific product or service your organization provides and
   list as many important features as you can.

    LE
                 Besides being familiar with your own products and services,
                 you should also have a working knowledge of the products and
                 services of your competitors. Such knowledge will allow you to
                 emphasize the differences between their offerings and yours. A
                 wise consumer has probably shopped around and knows the
                 competitors’ advantages. Can you explain your advantages?

                 Chapter Summary
                 Everyone within a company has responsibilities as a customer
                 service representative. Some have more contact with customers
                 than others, but all employees influence the customer’s
  MP             Perceived Value (PV).

                 As a customer service representative, you have both internal and
                 external customers. Sometimes customer service representatives
                 do not recognize the importance of internal customer service.
                 However, if you are to have outstanding external customer
                 service, you must have outstanding internal customer service.

                 they are useless without a positive, caring attitude.

                 Your attitude is shown by your behaviors toward customers.
                 Behaviors are actions that other people can see you do. You
                 should maintain a set of standards to guide your customer
                 service behaviors in various situations. Being knowledgeable
                 about your product is a behavior that can help you build
                 perceived value for your customer. Become familiar with the
                 features of your products and services and be able to discuss
                 how these features can benefit your customers. Also be prepared
                 to describe the advantages your products and services offer
                 when compared to your competition.

Though the words you use are important, the way you say them
may be more important still. When you speak, only about 7

Your tone tells the customer a lot about your energy level,

interest, disposition, attitude, and enthusiasm at that instant.
For example, suppose you have just interacted with a difficult
customer and are still feeling some frustration from that
interaction. Unless you let go of that frustration immediately, it
could be reflected in your tone of voice when you interact with
your next customer. The hostile tone could put that customer
on the defensive, even if the words you speak are friendly.

Body Language: Yours and Theirs
We’ve seen that the words we speak convey 7 percent of our
meaning and our tone of voice conveys 55 percent of our
meaning. The remaining 38 percent is conveyed by our body
language. Body language can include our posture, gestures,
facial expressions, and the way we dress and groom ourselves.

Improving Your Telephone Communication
In some organizations, such as mail-order companies, customer
service representatives may never see their customers face to face
Telephones fill the void when customers cannot come to our
place of business. Because you are not dealing face to face with
customers when you speak to them by phone, you lose an
important part of the communication link—body language
When you interact by phone, you must rely on other aspects of
communication to make up for the lack of body language.

One way you can make up for a lack of face-to-face contact with
your customers is by dealing with their calls promptly. Put
yourself in the customer’s shoes. What goes through your mind

■ “Mr. Able, please tell me how the accident happened.”

   “Well, Mr. Johnson, it all started that morning. I’d had a touch
   of the flu, so I decided to go to the doctor. My wife couldn’t take
   me, so I had to drive my pickup. The pickup is hard to start and
   doesn’t have power steering. Well anyway, I left at about 10
   that morning for my doctor’s appointment, which was at noon.
   Since it’s only a 10-minute drive to the doctor’s office, I decided
   to pick up my friend Jim and have a cup of coffee before my
   appointment. But when I got to Jim’s house, he wasn’t home,
   so I decided to go have coffee by myself.”

   “Mr. Able, excuse me for interrupting, but didn’t the accident
   happen after your doctor’s appointment?”
                                                                         39

                 Most people would agree that Mr. Able likes to talk. This is his

                 needs the specific facts of the accident in order to complete his

                 We can group people’s communication preferences into four
                 basic communication styles:

                 ◆   The “don’t waste my time” style

                 ◆   The “let’s get acquainted” style

When upset or frustrated, “let’s get acquainted” people become
chatty, talking about trivial things. They may appear shallow,
complacent, unwilling to listen, and even egotistical. To help

                    can become very rigid, headstrong, difficult to please, and

          have difficulty. The key to working successfully with all types
          of communication styles is first to recognize the customer’s
          communication style and then to adapt your style to the
          customer’s. If the customer needs a lot of time or information,
          provide it. If they don’t, then don’t. In communication, one
          style does not fit all.

Chapter Summary
Most of us probably assume that we are good communicators.
But in reality, we retain only about 10 percent of what we hear.

Improving your listening skills is the first step in providing
outstanding customer service. You can develop active listening
skills by taking the following steps when a customer is speaking:

◆   Avoiding distractions
                                                                                       2
◆   Making eye contact

◆   Confirming

◆   Questioning

◆   Reflecting

A second important customer service skill is to be sure that you
use positive words when speaking to a customer. Don’t tell
customers what you can’t do for them (“I don’t know how to do
that”). Instead, tell them what you can do (“I’ll find someone
who can help you with that”).

and 38 percent by body language. When you speak with a
customer on the phone, you lack the ability to communicate
through body language. You can compensate for the lack of
face-to-face contact by handling all customer calls promptly and
putting a smile in your voice when you speak over the phone.

Everyone has a communication style. We tend to communicate
better with those who have similar communication styles.
Therefore, you must understand the customer’s style and your
own and be willing to adapt your style to theirs. Doing this
will dramatically increase understanding and improve
customer relationships.                                                           45

               interacts with a customer, you are engaged in a customer
          encounter. Customer encounters include situations in which:

          ◆    A new customer makes a buying decision.

          ◆    A repeat customer brings you return business.

          ◆    A customer with a problem comes to you for a solution.

          The customer encounter is the most critical step in the customer
          service system. A successful customer encounter goes beyond the
          initial decision to buy your product or service. Customers leave a
          successful customer service encounter with the feeling that they
          have received outstanding customer service.

Unfortunately, most customers walk away from a customer
encounter with the feeling that the service was either “nothing
to write home about” or poor. And customers who leave

without receiving outstanding customer service will not seek out
that organization the next time they decide to use a similar

Showing Customers That You Value
Their Business
Your first step in creating a successful customer encounter is
to let customers know that you value them and their business.
Remember, customers take their business where they feel it is
appreciated. Consider the following example:

■ Rosa needs to return a gift to a large department store. She
  waits patiently in line and finally gets to the return clerk. The
  clerk, who is very busy, does not look up, but carries on a
  conversation with another clerk. Rosa tries to get the clerk’s
  attention to ask her a question about something else she
  would like to purchase. The clerk reluctantly looks up and tells
                                                                                   49

Understanding Customer Behavior and
Creating Positive Outcomes
■ Sharon hung up the phone and rubbed her ear. Sometimes
  she just didn’t understand her customers. “I don’t know why he
  yelled at me like that,” she thought. “All I wanted to do was help
  him.”

Why do customers behave the way they do, and how can a
SA

customer service professional influence that behavior? As we
discussed previously, behavior involves action; it is something
other people can see us do. Behaviors are triggered by a
stimulus—something in the environment that inspires us to act.
A stimulus can be the stop sign that causes us to put on the
brakes or the hunger pangs that tell us to reach for a snack.
Whatever their nature, these stimuli lead us to act or behave in
certain ways. In turn, the way we behave based on those stimuli
leads to a positive or negative outcome—we avoid hitting an
oncoming car or our hunger pangs are satisfied. Figure 1 below
illustrates this process.

  Trigger—leads to—Behavior—leads to—Outcome
Figure 1                                                               51
● Managing the Customer Encounter


                    People are more likely to respond to stimuli when they perceive
                    that the outcome of their behavior will:




    LE
                    ◆   Be immediate.

                    ◆   Be positive.

                    ◆   Have a high probability of happening.

                    They are less likely to respond when they believe that a positive
                    outcome will occur sometime in the future or has a low
                    probability of happening, or when they believe the outcome
                    will be negative.

                        without a hassle. She believes that in order to get what she
                        wants (positive outcome) she has to exhibit behaviors that
                        indicate she is upset.

                    This situation illustrates a customer service policy that triggers
                    negative behaviors in customers. If the customer knew that the
                    salesperson was willing to work with her, she would probably
                    exhibit pleasant behaviors. If the salesperson has the latitude,
                    she could ask a question, such as “Would you like to select
                    another sweater?” By doing this, she would create an immediate,
                    certain, and positive outcome for the customer. This would
                    increase the likelihood the customer would be satisfied with the
52                  encounter and return.
                            Managing the Customer Encounter ●

Note: Customer service representatives sometimes reinforce
negative behaviors in customers. We have created a group of
consumers who believe they must get angry, yell, or make a




    LE
scene to get what they want. We unintentionally reinforce that
behavior by giving in to their demands. People who do not
exhibit this type of behavior may not get what they want under
the same circumstances. Try to provide satisfaction for all
customers, especially those that approach you with courtesy and
respect. If a customer tries to create a scene, defuse the situation,
then deal with the request.

          When the customer is face to face:
          ◆   Introduce yourself and get the customer’s first and
              last name.




    LE
          ◆   Make sure you get enough information to get the
              customer to the right person. In our opening example, a
              few questions would have gotten the customer to the right
              insurance agent.

          ◆   Tell the customer the name of the person that can help. For
              example, “Bill Jones is our specialist in that area. I’ll
              introduce you to him.”

          ◆   Personally introduce the customer to the person who can
  MP          help. For example, “Bill, I’d like you to meet Angie Cupp.
              She’s interested in our new business software.”

          ◆   Make sure this person can help the customer. For example,
              ask Bill, “Do you have time to assist Angie?” Find out how
              long it will be before Bill can help, and ask the customer if
              that is acceptable. If not, get Bill to call her back. If the
              customer chooses to wait, stay with the customer; offer a
              cup of coffee or a soft drink.

          ◆   Thank the customer for allowing you to help. “Angie, thank
              you for shopping with us, and if I can be of any more
              assistance, please let me know.” Be sure to tell the customer

              yours again.

          ◆   Ask a few questions to get information that will help you
              direct the customer to the right person.

    you have.

◆   Make sure the person can help the customer at this time.

◆   If your coworker cannot help the customer at this time, find
    someone who can or set up a time when the person who can

◆   Tell the customer that you will connect him or her to the
    person who can help. For example, “Ms. Adams, I will

Making the Customer’s Problem
Your Problem
■ “All I do all day long is solve other people’s problems,” Brian
  complained about his job at the software help desk. “How can
  customers be so dumb? Why don’t they read the owner’s
  manual? It answers most of their questions. It even has a
  troubleshooting section. They want to blame us for not making
  the computers more user friendly. I wish they would solve their
  own problems instead of calling me.”

Many of the customers you encounter come to you because they
have a problem they need help solving. They may have even
                                                                                   59

                  helping solve the problem. The best way to view the customer’s

Viewing the       Viewing the customer’s problem as your own helps focus your
customer’s        attention on a winning solution rather than just “getting the

attention on a    1. Define the problem.
winning              Your first step is to come up with a specific definition of the
  MP
solution rather
than just
                     problem. The best way to do this is by listening to the
                     customer. Sometimes the customer may be upset or even
“getting the         verbally abusive, but hidden in the emotional words is a
customer off         perceived problem that is very real to the customer. Listen
my back.”            for the problem. You may want to write the problem down.
                     You should also note what caused the problem if you know
                     or suspect. These causes do not have to be discussed in great
                     detail with the customer. However, they will provide you
                     with useful information when you are trying to improve
                     your customer service system (see Chapter 5).

                  2. List alternatives.
                     One solution does not fit all customers, even if the problem
                     is the same. Offer alternatives to the customer. Try asking
SA

                     customers for their suggestions for solving the problem. This
                     gives customers ownership in the solution as well as a sense
                     of control.

                  3. Pick a solution.
                     Picking a solution that is satisfactory to both the customer
                     and you is crucial to good customer relations. If the
                     customer participates in the selection, this will build
                     ownership and acceptance.

                  4. Implement the solution.
                     This is the step where most problem solvers have difficulty.
                     People have good intentions but, for a variety of reasons,
                     sometimes fail to implement what they said they would do.
60                   The consequence of not implementing the solution to a
                            Managing the Customer Encounter ●

   customer problem is severely damaged customer
   relationships. Making notes or creating a “to do” list helps.




    LE
5. Make sure the problem is solved.
   Making sure the problem is solved goes beyond just
   checking that the agreed-upon actions have been
   implemented. The customer has to determine if the solution
   has solved his or her problem. This will require follow-up on
   your part. Ask the customer if the problem was solved.

When dealing with customer problems, you should always
follow the five steps. It does not matter how simple or complex
the problem, the problem-solving process will work. Sometimes                         3
the entire process can take five minutes, or it can take five
  MP
months. The steps are the same.

Consider how you would use the five-step process to deal with
the situation described in the following case study:

■ John takes his car to a mechanic because the front of the car
  is making a noise that has gotten progressively worse. The             Case
  mechanic looks at the car and test drives it. He tells John that       Study
  a slipping fan belt is making the noise and that the fan belt
  should be replaced and adjusted. The mechanic does the work
  and shows John the worn fan belt that was replaced.

   Three days later, John returns with the car and tells the mechanic
   that the noise is still there. Again, the mechanic listens and test
SA

   drives the car. He concludes that the water pump is now making
   a noise. The water pump was probably worn, and replacing the
   fan belt put too much additional stress on it, creating the noise.
   Eventually, the pump must be replaced. The mechanic must now
   explain the situation to John.




                                                                                 61

             Take a Moment
             Defining the problem is the first step in the problem-solving




    LE
             process. If you were the mechanic, how would you define
             the problem for John? Write your statement below.

             –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––-–––––––––

             What are the next two steps the mechanic needs to take
             to guide John through the problem-solving process? What
             could he say in each step?

             Step 2: _________________________________________

             _______________________________________________
  MP         Step 3: _________________________________________

             _______________________________________________




          The mechanic in our case study might handle the situation in
          the following way:

          Mechanic:
          John, the noise you’re hearing now is the water pump. Have you
          heard this noise before?
SA

          John:
          I don’t remember hearing it.

          Mechanic:
          Sometimes when we replace a fan belt and tighten it to factory
          specifications, a marginal water pump may fail. That seems to be
          what’s happening here. [Define the problem.] I think that this water
          pump will last a little while longer. I could try adding some water
          pump lubricant to the coolant, which might help. However, I
          suggest that you replace it as soon as possible, especially if you’re
          planning any trips. [List alternatives.] What would you like me to
          do? [Pick a solution.]

          The mechanic could then complete the problem-solving process
          by implementing whatever solution John chose and following
62        up to be sure that the solution worked for John.

Telling the Customer “No”
No matter how good your problem-solving skills, you will
encounter situations in which you have to tell a customer “no.”




    LE
Consider the following example:

■ Claudine is a customer service representative with the local
  electric company. Max, who has just moved into the area, has
  come in to have the electricity to his house turned on. He
  completes the information and authorizes a credit check.
  Claudine calls his previous electric provider and finds that Max
  left without paying his final bill, and it is three months overdue.
  Claudine has to tell Max, who is waiting in the lobby, that she
  will need a $150 deposit or she will not be able to authorize a            3
  hook-up. Claudine calls Max into her office.
  MP   If you were Claudine, what would you say to Max?

       _______________________________________________

       _______________________________________________

   Claudine tells Max that he must pay the $150. He responds
   with, “Why do I have to pay a deposit? My cousin moved here
   last spring, and he didn’t have to pay anything. All you electric
   companies are alike! You don’t care about my situation.”

       How would you respond to Max’s statement?

       _______________________________________________
SA

       _______________________________________________

The key to moving forward in this situation is to work with
Max to reach a win/win situation. What Claudine is able to do
for Max will depend on company guidelines and state laws. She
may be able to offer a payment plan for the $150 or perhaps
take a credit card. Whatever she eventually offers, Claudine
must remain firm but respectful when dealing with Max and
show empathy for his feelings.

No matter how much you wish to help your customers, you will
occasionally find yourself in situations in which you are unable
to correct the problem or meet customer requests. So how do
you say “no” without losing the customer? The following steps
can help you successfully deliver a “no” message.
                                                                        63
● Managing the Customer Encounter


                  1. Apologize for not being able to meet expectations.

                     ■ “I’m sorry, but we can’t fill the order until next week.”




    LE
                  2. Give them facts about the situation, not excuses.

                     ■ “There’s been such a demand for these boots that the
                       factory is behind in filling our order.”

                     Whether customers view your statements as facts or excuses
                     will depend on how willing they are to trust you. If you have
                     followed the principles of good customer service in past
                     encounters with your customers, they will be more likely to
                     view your statement as fact.
  MP
Avoid
                     Avoid statements such as “the policy does not allow me to
                     give you a refund.” While this may be a fact, the customer
statements           will generally see you as hiding behind an excuse. Try to
such as “the         explain the reasons for the policy. For example, if your
policy does not      policy requires you to get a photo identification when you
allow me to          accept travelers’ checks, say, “Our identification policy
give you a           allows us to ensure that no one will cash your checks
refund.”             except you.”

                     Policies do not fit every situation, and customer service
                     representatives should be allowed to use their own
                     judgment. Whenever possible, well-trained customer service
                     representatives should be given guidelines rather than rules.
SA

                  3. Be firm with the customer, but gentle.
                     This may seem like a contradiction in terms, but it isn’t.
                     What it means is that you can be firm without making the
                     customer feel rejected or deserted. Part of being gentle is
                     acknowledging the customer’s feelings. When you say “no,”
                     the customer is disappointed. The intensity of the feeling
                     will depend on how the customer views the importance of
                     the request. Acknowledging how the customer feels
                     demonstrates empathy. Consider the following example:

                     ■ You are the maitre d’ at a small, popular restaurant. It is
                       Saturday night, all the tables are full, and a large party has
                       reserved a corner of the restaurant for a private party.

64
                           Managing the Customer Encounter ●

       Mary Alice and David, two regular customers, come in
       without a reservation. They ask for a table and you have
       none to give them. What can you do?




    LE
   You could handle the situation by saying, “I’m sorry, David
   and Mary Alice, but I will not be able to seat you this
   evening. I know how disappointed you must feel. We have
   a group of 22 people that reserved an area of the restaurant
   for a party. I’ll be glad to make a reservation for you for
   tomorrow, and the drinks will be on me.”

4. Remain calm if customers continue their demands.
   Some customers will continue to push you even after you                            3
   have told them you cannot meet their expectations. When
   this happens, keep in mind that they are not mad at you as
  MP
   an individual. Chances are, they are having difficulty dealing
   with their feelings. Most of the time they are mad at the
   situation and may take it out on you. But remain calm, be
   firm, and be gentle. Repeat the steps above.

   Sometimes customers persist, and conflict may develop.
   We’ll discuss how to handle conflict in Chapter 4. If a
   customer becomes loud or animated, move the conversation
   out of earshot of other customers. Not moving can upset
   some of your customers and leave them with a negative
   impression of your organization.

                     Take time to examine what happened and learn from each
                     customer encounter. Review the encounter and focus on
                     what you did well. Don’t blame yourself for any mistakes
                     you made. These are opportunities to learn. Decide how you

contact with the customer. An important final step is providing

follow-up to ensure that the customer is satisfied and received
everything that you promised.

Customers expect you to do what you say you will do when you

meeting customer needs or solving customer problems. Based on
what they agree to do for you, tell the customer what will be done.
If the people on whom you are depending fail to live up to their

argument for good internal customer service). However, you are

          Chapter Summary
          The customer encounter is the most critical step in the
          customer service system. If the encounter is positive, the




    LE
          customer leaves satisfied, but if the encounter is negative,
          the customer may never return.

          As a customer service professional, your job is to create an
          immediate and positive encounter for the customer. You can
          do this by:

          ◆   Showing customers that you value their business.

          ◆   Understanding customer behavior and creating
              positive outcomes.

             When customers are dissatisfied, they express their displeasure
             in a number of ways. Some dissatisfied customers will complain,
             but a number of others will say nothing. Research suggests that
             more than 95 percent of the customers who are unhappy with
             your organization will not complain to anyone within the
             organization. However, most will tell at least one other person

Determining Why Your Customers
Complain
As we saw in Chapter 3, you can turn a customer complaint
into a positive experience for yourself and the customer by
following the steps for a successful customer encounter. As you
follow these steps, however, remember that customer complaints
carry an additional responsibility for the customer service

professional—you need to determine why each customer is
complaining and gather enough information to help your
organization correct those situations that cause complaints.

Customers complain for a variety of reasons. Sometimes they
complain because a product or service failed to live up to their
expectations. In these situations, you should look on customer
complaints as valuable feedback that can help your organization
continually improve its output. As you work with customers to
resolve this type of problem, take notes on the difficulties
customers are having so you can pass on the information to
someone who can correct the root cause of the problem.

Recognizing Different Conflict Styles
No matter how hard you work with customers to resolve their
complaints, conflicts will develop. Different people handle




    LE
conflict in different ways. Some resolve the conflict calmly,
others yell, and others simply avoid the matter altogether. We
may deal with conflicts very differently depending on the nature
of the conflict and the other people involved. We can refer to
the way we most typically handle conflict as our conflict style.

Our conflict style is based on our approach to two dimensions
of conflict: our concern for the other person/relationship
(cooperativeness) and our concern for our own self-interests
(assertiveness). Our conflict style is determined by how willing
we are to cooperate and how much we want to get our way.

When we            When we approach a disagreement, we tend to demonstrate

                      problems when people exhibit this style. They will let you
                      know what they want and are willing to work with you to
                      get it.

  MP                  This style of conflict is high in cooperativeness but low on

                      accommodate others because they are willing to give up
                      what they want in order to preserve the relationship. But,
                      though they give in easily, they walk away with a sense of
                      loss. You will have to dig to understand what they really
                      want, because they will not tell you without prompting.
                      Customers exhibiting this style will often take a lot of abuse,
                      but when the conflict is over, they will never return.

                      appear inflexible and uncooperative. They want to win. We
                      all tend to demonstrate this style when the conflict is a
                      matter of principle or violates one of our values.

                   4. Avoiders
                      This style of conflict is not very cooperative and not very
                      assertive. People exhibiting this style want to avoid conflict.
                      They may not care about the solution, or they just hope the
                      problem will go away. They generally will not tell you what’s
                      wrong, and if you ask them what the problem is, they often
                      respond, “Oh, nothing.” Their facial expression will
                      sometimes let you know that they disagree.

When dealing with customer dissatisfaction, you need to
consider both your conflict style and the customer’s. You

cannot control a customer’s approach to conflict resolution, but
you can control your own. Once you recognize which style a
customer is exhibiting, you can adopt the conflict style that best
fits the situation.

For example, if the customer exhibits a Competitor style and
you adopt the same style, the conflict will escalate with no hope
of resolution as both of you compete to win. A more effective
approach would be for you to adopt an Obligor or Negotiator
style and compromise with the customer—if you are
empowered to make the necessary decisions.

           Calming Upset Customers
SA

           ■ Two customers complain about receiving a cold steak in a
             restaurant. One calls the server over to the table and politely
             asks the server to warm the steak and then bring it back. The
             other calls the server to the table and in a loud, sarcastic tone
             of voice asks, “What kind of restaurant are you running here?
             My steak is cold! Let me talk to the manager!”

           In the previous example, the same issue triggered very different
           behaviors in the two people. We might describe the first
           customer as simply being displeased because of her low
           emotional level. We might describe the second customer as
           being upset or demanding because of the high level of emotion
           he expressed.

           Customers become upset for many reasons. Sometimes people

Do not mistake rude, unpleasant, or obnoxious people as

requiring the most attention. The person who complains
politely deserves as much, if not more, attention as the person
who makes a scene.                                                                   4
Whatever the reason for your customer’s unruly behavior, the
following steps should help you calm the customer and defuse
the situation:

1. Recognize that the customer is not angry at you
   personally. The customer is angry at the organization. You
   represent the organization, and most customers believe you
   have more control over what happens than you do. Not
   taking customer remarks personally can be difficult,
   especially when a customer is “in your face.” Make a point of
SA

   ignoring unpleasant remarks, and focus on completing the
   remaining steps in this process.

2. Acknowledge that a problem exists.
   This does not mean you have to agree or take the blame. If
   the customer is unhappy, you must become a participant in
   resolving the problem. Say something like, “Let’s see how I
   can help you.”

3. Tell the customer what you can do, not what you can’t
   do. Telling upset customers what you can’t do only frustrates
   them more. Focus on the future, not the past. Help the
   customer generate alternative solutions, and move forward
   with what you can do for them. You will probably want to
   use the problem-solving steps discussed in Chapter 3.                       79

               4. Keep the lines of communication open.
                  This is not the time to give ultimatums—that will only close
                  the conversation. If you can’t give customers what they want,




    LE
                  ask for alternatives and suggestions. Sometimes you will
                  simply have to say “no,” but not until you’ve considered
                  every possibility.

               5. Stay in control of your emotions at all times.
                  You have a better chance of resolving an upset customer’s
                  problems when you respond with calming behaviors. Don’t
                  exhibit the same hostile behaviors as the customer. Chances
                  are, other customers are watching you and how you deal
                  with the situation. You best represent the company and
                  yourself when you act professionally. Responding with
  MP              genuine concern for the customer will often reduce his or
                  her emotions. Try saying something like, “This seems to have
                  really upset you, and I want to help solve this problem.”

               On occasion, some customers may become abusive. Abusive
               behavior goes beyond just being rude or loud. Abusive
               behavior includes:
               ◆   Abusive or obscene language (calling you vulgar names).
               ◆   Violent threats against your organization.
               ◆   Personal threats against you.

               2. Ask abusive customers if they would like to talk to your
                  supervisor. You should inform the supervisor when a

                  what to expect. Don’t use this as a crutch. It should be used

You may find it helpful to put yourself in the other person’s place
for just a moment. Ask yourself, “How would I feel if this
happened to me?” If you have trouble understanding the other
person’s reaction, ask questions to gain insight and understanding.
Showing concern in this way may reduce their emotional
display—and yours as well.

Recognizing the humor in an emotional situation can also be
helpful. However, remember that humor can be a double-edged
sword at emotional times—use it appropriately. Make sure the
humor is directed at you—never make fun of the customer.
SA

When used correctly, humor can be a powerful stress reducer.

You may also find it helpful to take a time-out. This involves
taking time away from the stressful situation to relax and regain
your composure. You should usually take a time-out after the
customer encounter is over. However, it may be necessary to
take a time-out during a very emotional confrontation.

During a time-out, concentrate on something positive rather
than the situation that generated the emotion. If possible, leave
the area where the emotionally charged event occurred. Try
going for coffee, going for a walk, performing deep breathing
exercises, or going to visit a person who is always upbeat.

                                                                                  81

When customers are dissatisfied, they express their displeasure

percent of your dissatisfied customers will not tell anyone within
your organization.

Many of the customers who do complain care about your
organization and want to help it improve. They may complain
because a product failed to meet their expectations, or they may
be dissatisfied with the level of service they received. Part of your
responsibility as a customer service professional is to correct
those situations that cause your customers to complain.

No matter how hard you work with customers to resolve their
  MP
complaints, conflicts can develop. When we deal with a conflict,
we tend to demonstrate one of five general conflict styles based             4
on our level of cooperativeness and assertiveness. The five
styles are:
◆   Partners
◆   Obligors
◆   Competitors
◆   Avoiders
◆   Negotiators

Once you recognize which style a customer is exhibiting, you
can adopt the conflict style that best fits the situation.

Customers become upset for many reasons. The following steps
can help calm your customer and defuse the situation:
1. Recognize that the customer is not angry at you personally.
2. Acknowledge that a problem exists.
3. Tell the customer what you can do, not what you can’t do.
4. Keep the lines of communication open.
5. Stay in control of your emotions at all times.

Reviewing Your Customer Service System
You can move beyond auditing individual departments to
reviewing your entire customer service system. This is an
excellent way to see how the various parts of the system fit
together and to make sure that all the actions taken throughout
the system work to serve the customer. A convenient and
effective way to review and analyze your customer service system
is to use the Continuous Improvement Process, which consists
of seven steps.




                                                                   89
● Continuously Improving Customer Service


                  Step 1: Determine the Customer’s Expectations
                  of Service
                  Whenever customers buy a product or service from you, they




    LE
                  have certain expectations. You need a clear idea of what these
                  expectations are in order to determine if your customer service
                  system is succeeding. As Stephen Covey puts it, begin with the
                  end in mind.

                  Encouraging Customer Feedback
The best way      The best way to learn what customers want from you is to ask
to learn what     them. Remember, only 5 percent of your customers will take
customers         the time to complain to you if they are dissatisfied; you need to

is to ask them.
  MP              There are many ways to solicit feedback from customers. If your
                  organization wants to create a survey that statistically reflects all
                  of your customers, it is best to work with a survey expert. An
                  expert can help you identify the demographics of your customer
                  base and select a sample of customers that reflect those
                  demographics. An expert can also help you develop a variety of
                  feedback vehicles, including:
                  ◆   Telephone surveys
                  ◆   Mail surveys
                  ◆   Customer focus/feedback groups
SA

                  ◆   Employee surveys
                  ◆   Internet surveys
                  ◆   Customer comment cards

                  As a customer service professional, you can also conduct your
                  own informal customer research. Though informal research will
                  not be as statistically accurate as a more structured research
                  project, it can provide you with valuable insights into what your
                  customers are thinking.

                  On the most basic level, informal customer research involves
                  taking the time to talk with your customers about your
                  products and services and really listening to what they have to
                  say. Keep notes on their reactions, and review your notes
90
                 Continuously Improving Customer Service

periodically to see if you can identify common reactions. Here
are some questions you might ask:




    LE
◆   “What do you like best about our product/service?”

◆   “In what ways could we improve our product/service?”

◆   “Have you ever used our competitors’ products/services?
    How do our products/services compare?”

Avoid global questions such as “Was everything satisfactory?” In   Wouldn’t you

survey or focus group. Here are some tips for devising your own
customer research:
                                                                                    5
1. Develop a list of questions and test them on a pilot group.
   (You can sometimes use employees as a pilot group.) Make
   sure the questions will help you gain the type of information
   you seek.

2. Determine how you will collect the data. Will you ask survey
   questions in person, by mail, or over the telephone, or will
SA

   you conduct focus groups?

3. Select your sample of interviewees from the population of
   customers. Be sure that you survey enough customers to
   allow you to identify any trends in their responses. A good
   rule of thumb is to survey at least 100 customers. Work with
   a random sample of customers; in other words, select the
   sample from the overall population without any regard to
   who is chosen.

As previously mentioned, though informal customer research
can provide you with valuable insight into your customers’
expectations, it does not provide the statistical accuracy of a
survey developed and conducted by an expert. If you are
considering major changes or significant capital investments,
consult a survey professional—it will be worth the investment.                 91
● Continuously Improving Customer Service


                  Step 2: Identify the Steps Customers Must Take
                  to Obtain Your Product or Service
                  In this step, you’ll trace the customer service process from your




    LE
                  customers’ initial contact with your organization through their
                  receipt of your product or service and final billing. Following
                  the flow of this process will help you understand the details of
                  each action or operation you are performing. Remember, every

                  Step 3: Go Into Detail
                  Make a detailed list of all the actions members of your
                  organization perform for customer service. If your company
                  uses a customer order form, identify each time someone does
                  something with the form. Identify how the form moves through
                  the various parts of the customer service system, how long it
                  takes, and what contributes to failures.

                  Step 4: Evaluate Each Action or Operation to
                  Determine What Is Working Effectively
SA

                  The goal in this step is to look for ineffective, unnecessary, and
                  inefficient actions or operations. You can evaluate the actions in
                  your customer service system by asking these five questions:

                  ◆   What is the customer service action?

                  ◆   Is this action or operation necessary?

                  ◆   How can I do it faster and cheaper?

                  ◆   How can I improve my accuracy?

                  ◆   How can I build trust and confidence in my customer?

◆   Who else needs to be involved?
◆   What are the limitations or restrictions on what can
    be done?
◆   Who will follow up to make sure the actions are completed?
SA

Step 7: Follow Up
In order for your action plan to succeed, someone must follow
up to ensure that the actions are completed. In addition,
someone must make sure that the actions taken are producing
the desired changes in customer service. Sometimes this is
referred to as providing accountability.

Following the seven steps of the Continuous Improvement
Process will allow you to identify and correct those weaknesses
that are keeping your customer service system from being truly
outstanding. However, the process does take patience.

After implementing corrective actions in your customer service
areas, don’t expect a sudden significant improvement in your
customer surveys. It takes time for the customer to be impacted                   93
● Continuously Improving Customer Service


          by the changes. Customers need to have several encounters with
          the improved service before you make an impression on them.
          It is only then that customers will reflect the changes on your




    LE
          customer service surveys.

          Putting Your Learning to Work
          In the course of this book, we’ve seen how you can improve
          your own customer service skills and how you can help your
          organization improve its customer service system. Only one step
          remains: putting your knowledge into action. If you are truly
          serious about improving your customer service, you will need an
          action plan. Following is an Action Planning Form. Make
          several copies of it. You will use two copies of it as you complete
          this chapter, and you may want to use more later.
  MP
          Step 1: External Customer Service
          Review each page of this book, paying particular attention to
          the exercises you were asked to complete. Using one copy of the
          Action Planning Form, complete the form and develop the
          action steps you will take to improve your external customer
          service. Be specific when defining actions, and make sure they
          are feasible.

          Step 2: Internal Customer Service
          You can’t have outstanding external customer service without
          outstanding internal customer service. While this book was not

          principles and techniques apply. With that in mind, review the
          book again. This time think about the material in terms of
          internal customer service. Using a second copy of the Action

Chapter Summary
Outstanding customer service is more than a collection of skills
and techniques. It is a system that involves every part of your




    LE
organization. As a customer service professional, you are
responsible for continually trying to improve your organization’s
customer service system. You can do this by conducting a
customer service audit of individual departments within your
organization or by reviewing your entire customer service system.

Customer feedback is an important part of any review. You can
gather feedback informally through your conversations with
your customers, or you can design your own survey or focus
group questions. If you are planning major changes in your
organization, you should hire an expert to conduct a formal
  MP
survey so that you gather the most reliable information possible.

To put everything you’ve learned into practice, you will need to
develop an action plan. Following through on this plan will help
you provide your external and internal customers with the type
of outstanding customer service that builds loyalty and                  5
encourages repeat business.
