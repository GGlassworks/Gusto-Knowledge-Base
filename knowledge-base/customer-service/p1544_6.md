                                                     Why Report These
                                                     Payments?
                                                     Drug dealers and smugglers often use large
                                                     cash payments to “launder” money from illegal
                                                     activities. Laundering means converting “dirty”
                                                     or illegally-gained money to “clean” money.

                                                          The government can often trace this laun-

                                                     Laws passed by Congress require you to report
                                                     these payments. Your compliance with these
                                                     laws provides valuable information that can
                                                     stop those who evade taxes and those who
                                                     profit from the drug trade and other criminal ac-

                                                     the scope of these laws to help trace funds
                                                     used for terrorism.
