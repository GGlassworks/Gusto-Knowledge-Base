     A person can’t qualify more than one taxpayer to use the head of household filing status for the year.
 2
  The term “qualifying child” is defined in chapter 3. Note. If you are a noncustodial parent, the term “qualifying child” for head of household filing status doesn't include a child who is your
 qualifying child only because of the rules described under Children of divorced or separated parents (or parents who live apart) under Qualifying Child in chapter 3. If you are the
 custodial parent and those rules apply, the child is generally your qualifying child for head of household filing status even though the child isn't a qualifying child you can claim as a
 dependent.
 3
   This person is a qualifying person if the only reason you can’t claim the person as a dependent is that you, or your spouse if filing jointly, can be claimed as a dependent on another
 taxpayer’s return.
 4
     The term “qualifying relative” is defined in chapter 3.
 5
     If you can claim a person as a dependent only because of a multiple support agreement, that person isn't a qualifying person. See Multiple Support Agreement in chapter 3.

               Caution. This table is only an overview of the rules. For details, see the rest of this chapter.

     • You can’t claim any dependents if you (or your spouse if filing jointly) could be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer,
        unless that taxpayer files a return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid.

     • You can’t claim a married person who files a joint return as a dependent unless that joint return is filed only to claim a refund of
        withheld income tax or estimated tax paid.

     • You can’t claim a person as a dependent unless that person is a U.S. citizen, U.S. resident alien, U.S. national, or a resident of
        Canada or Mexico.1

     • You can’t claim a person as a dependent unless that person is your qualifying child or qualifying relative.

     5. The child must not be filing a joint return for the year (unless
        that joint return is filed only to get a refund of income tax
        withheld or estimated tax paid).
 If the child meets the rules to be a qualifying child of more than one
 person, generally only one person can actually treat the child as a
 qualifying child. See Qualifying Child of More Than One Person,
 later, to find out which person is the person entitled to claim the
 child as a qualifying child.
