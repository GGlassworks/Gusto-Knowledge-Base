                    The Art of Negotiation
           Negotiation Strategies, Tactics, Styles & Glossary




Introduction

Like it or not, everybody is a negotiator.
It’s something you do all the time in your
work as well as in your personal life.
Getting familiar with negotiation
strategies and tactics will enable you to
build, maintain, and improve important
workplace relationships and to make you
more efficient. Instead of spending hours
arguing with people and trying to force
them to do what you want, you can reach
agreements, find solutions to tough problems, and keep work moving ahead
more easily and with less effort if you negotiate effectively. In addition,
being a good negotiator helps you achieve important goals and get what you
need and want for yourself, your department, and the organization.

Negotiation Strategies

Negotiation can take a wide variety of forms, from a trained negotiator
acting on behalf of a particular organization or position in a formal setting, to
an informal negotiation between friends. Negotiation can be contrasted with
mediation, where a neutral third party listens to each side's arguments and
attempts to help craft an agreement between the parties. It can also be
compared with arbitration, which resembles a legal proceeding. In
arbitration, both sides make an argument as to the merits of their case and
the arbitrator decides the outcome. This negotiation is also sometimes called
positional or hard-bargaining negotiation.

There are two relatively distinct types of negotiation. They are known as
distributive negotiations and integrative negotiations. Different negotiation

                                                                        Page 3 of 22

theorists may use different labels for the two general types and distinguish
them in different ways.


1. Distributive Negotiation

Distributive negotiation is also sometimes called positional or hard-
bargaining negotiation. It tends to approach negotiation on the model of
haggling in a market. In a distributive negotiation, each side often adopts an
extreme position, knowing that it will not be accepted, and then employs a
combination of guile, bluffing, and brinkmanship in order to cede as little as
possible before reaching a deal. Distributive bargainers conceive of
negotiation as a process of distributing a fixed amount of value.

The term distributive implies that there is a finite amount of the thing being
distributed or divided among the people involved. Sometimes this type of
negotiation is referred to as the distribution of a "fixed pie." There is only so
much to go around, but the proportion to be distributed is variable.
Distributive negotiation is also sometimes called win-lose because of the
assumption that one person's gain results in another person's loss. A
distributive negotiation often involves people who have never had a previous
interactive relationship, nor are they likely to do so again in the near future.
Simple everyday examples would be buying a car or a house.


2. Integrative Negotiation

Integrative negotiation is also sometimes called interest-based or principled
negotiation. It is a set of techniques that attempts to improve the quality
and likelihood of negotiated agreement by providing an alternative to
traditional distributive negotiation techniques. While distributive negotiation
assumes there is a fixed amount of value (a "fixed pie") to be divided
between the parties, integrative negotiation often attempts to create value
in the course of the negotiation ("expand the pie"). It focuses on the
underlying interests of the parties rather than their arbitrary starting
positions, approaches negotiation as a shared problem rather than a
personalized battle, and insists upon adherence to objective, principled
criteria as the basis for agreement.

Integrative negotiation often involves a higher degree of trust and the
forming of a relationship. It can also involve creative problem-solving that

                                                                        Page 4 of 22
www.PDHcenter.com              PDH Course P199              www.PDHonline.org


aims to achieve mutual gains. It is also sometimes called win-win
negotiation.

Positions vs Interests

A position is what you say you want or must have. Positional bargaining is
usually distributive - and may be inefficient in the sense that value may be
left on the table at the time of settlement because each party did not know
what the other really wanted - but it may help one party gain more short-
term profit. An interest is both an objective or need and reasons why you
want what you want. Interest-based bargaining add integrative potential.

In a negotiation, it is important to be able to distinguish between positions
and interests - both yours and the parties' with whom you are negotiating.
Depending on which one you decide to focus on will affect your negotiation
style and influence the outcomes. It is always good to ask yourself why you
want what you want. This will help you get a better understanding of what
your real goals are and could open up better deals for you.

Negotiation Tactics

Tactics are always an important part of the negotiating process. There are
many tactics that you may meet or use in negotiation. They can be fair, foul
or something in between, depending on the competitive or collaborative
style of the people involved and the seriousness of the outcomes. Often
times, tactics are employed in a subtle, difficult to identify manner. Below
are a few commonly used tactics.


1. Auction

Most people do not realize that auction is a special form of negotiation,
which sets up sellers or buyers to compete against one another. The bidding
process is designed to create competition to the seller’s advantage. When
multiple parties want the same thing, pit them against one another. When
people know that they may lose out on something, they will want it even
more. Not only do they want the thing that is being bid on, they also want to
win, just to win. Taking advantage of someone's competitive nature can
drive up the price.


2. Brinksmanship

One party aggressively pursues a set of terms to the point at which the
other negotiating party must either agree or walk away. Brinkmanship is a
type of "hard nut" approach to bargaining in which one party pushes the
other party to the "brink" or edge of what that party is willing to
accommodate. Successful brinksmanship convinces the other party they
have no choice but to accept the offer and there is no acceptable alternative
to the proposed agreement.


3. Bogey

Negotiators use the bogey tactic to pretend that an issue of little or no
importance to him or her is very important. Then, later in the negotiation,
the issue can be traded for a major concession of actual importance.




                                                                     Page 6 of 22
www.PDHcenter.com              PDH Course P199                www.PDHonline.org


4. Barter

Do you have any items that might be of interest to the seller? Could you
offer some services that would be of value to the seller? Consider making a
trade to eliminate or significantly offset the need for actual dollars in a
transaction. The idea is to use creativity in order to reach a deal that might
otherwise not come to fruition.


5. Bundle

A great way to augment your negotiation over price is to include other
items. When you reach an impasse in your negotiations, an offer to purchase
multiple quantities of the item or additional items might trigger flexibility on
the part of the seller.

The seller may be willing to lose a customer if it’s a single item. But when a
seller has the opportunity to make a much larger transaction, there is a
much greater likelihood he will be amenable to a lower price.


6. Chicken Tactic

Negotiators propose extreme measures, often bluffs, to force the other party
to chicken out and give them what they want. This tactic can be dangerous
when parties are unwilling to back down and go through with the extreme
measure.


7. Deadlines

Give the other party a deadline forcing them to make a decision. This
method uses time to apply pressure to the other party. Deadlines given can
be actual or artificial.


8. Don’t Make the First Offer

Whether you are buying or selling, you never want to make the first offer.
Why? Because the other party may offer a price that is a much better deal
than what you initially had in mind. If you’re buying, consider the starting
point to be the list price, but make it clear that the price is too high. From



                                                                        Page 7 of 22
www.PDHcenter.com                PDH Course P199                www.PDHonline.org


there, ask the seller if there is any flexibility and force the seller to offer you
a lower price. It is only at that point you should make your first offer.

But once you have made your offer, do not volunteer another price unless
and until the other party has responded with a counteroffer. Expect the
negotiations to be a back-and-forth process, but remain confident
throughout.


9. Good Cop/Bad Cop

The good cop/bad cop approach is typically used in team negotiations where
one member of the team makes extreme or unreasonable demands, and the
other offers a more rational approach. This tactic is named after a police
interrogation technique often portrayed in the media. The "good cop" will
appear more reasonable and understanding, and therefore, easier to work
with. In essence, it is using the law of relativity to attract cooperation. Bad
cop is usually not in the negotiation room and can be played by such roles as
attorneys, auditors, government regulators, spouses, bosses, and the
market place. This tactic is easy to spot because of its frequent use.


10. Use Silence When Necessary

Never respond too quickly to an offer. Pausing or even suspending
negotiations can convey that you’re not desperate to close the deal and that
you have other options. Silence can force a surprising amount of pressure on
the other party as well.


11. High Ball / Low Ball

A tactic used to make an offer that is unreasonably high or low for the
purpose of seeing if the other side can be fooled into paying/doing more/less
than an informed negotiator would agree to. The theory is that the extreme
offer will cause the other party to reevaluate his or her own opening offer
and move close to the resistance point (as far as you are willing to go to
reach an agreement). Another advantage is that the person giving the
extreme demand appears more flexible he or she makes concessions toward
a more reasonable outcome. A danger of this tactic is that the opposite party
may think negotiating is a waste of time.


                                                                          Page 8 of 22

12. The Nibble

Nibbling is asking for proportionally small concessions (usually 1 or 2% of
the total solution) that haven't been discussed previously just before closing
the deal. This method takes advantage of the other party's desire to close by
adding "just one more thing." Nibbles come at the very end of negotiations.
If you get Nibbled, be sure to Nibble back.


13. Keep It Light

You never want to let negotiations become too tense. Always feel free to
smile and inject some humor in the conversation. Lightening up the mood
can ingratiate you with your opponent while also conveying your negotiating
strength. If you do not appear to be taking the negotiation extremely
seriously, your opponent may conclude that you are ready to move on if you
don’t get the price you want.


14. If I Do this Will You Do That

In this tactic, one negotiator proposes a possible concession tied to the other
side’s concession. If they succeed in getting the other side to concede, they
then negotiate from this lower plateau.


15. Leaking Information

Also known as Planted Information, this tactic lets the other side ‘discover’
secret information that will change their perceptions or expectations. For
some reason humans trust what we learn about the other party by
coincidence more than what the other party actually is telling us about
themselves.


16. Limiting Your Authority Technique

Negotiators often find it useful to limit their own authority. This provides
opportunities for a negotiator to gather information, test the other side’s
positions, and explore potential concessions prior to being pressured into
making a decision. In this case, the negotiator will indicate that final
approval can only be provided by a higher authority.


                                                                       Page 9 of 22

17. Krunch Tactic

"You've got to do better than that." This puts pressure on the other party
without elaborating on "how much better." Often this tactic is used by a
participant to test the limits of the other party.


18. Merit Based Rule

Also known as the Equity Rule, this tactic requires that each participant
shares the negotiation pie based upon the various contributions and inputs
they have made to the specific business situation. Those who have
contributed more get more.


19. Be Willing to Walk Away

Even if it’s the car, television, or house of your dreams, if the seller won’t
come down to the maximum price you have set for your budget, force
yourself to walk out of the store or away from the deal. This strong stance
more often than not will get you the price you’re looking for, as the seller
doesn’t want to lose the sale.


20. Splitting the Difference

Taking the distance on an issue that stands between the latest positions and
giving each side half. It can be a tactic to make you think you are getting an
equitable result when in fact where the negotiation began was to the
advantage of the other side.


21. Bad Faith Negotiation

When a party pretends to negotiate, but secretly has no intention of
compromising, the party is considered to be negotiating in bad faith. For
example, one political party may pretend to negotiate, with no intention to
compromise, for political effect. Sometimes, bad faith negotiation is used to
win more time. It is important for a negotiator to recognize a bad faith
negotiation when it occurs.

Negotiation Styles

Complex and strategic negotiations involves many conflicting interests. A
simple, but typical, example is the buyer wants to buy at the lowest possible
price and the supplier wants sell at the highest possible price. How we
handle such negotiation conflicts determines the outcome of our negotiation.
According to Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument, conflict resolution
can be viewed along two dimensions:

   1. Assertiveness, i.e. the extent to which we attempt to satisfy our own
      concerns; and
   2. Cooperativeness, i.e. the extent to which we attempt to satisfy the
      other party’s concerns.

Figure 1 below illustrates five commonly referenced conflict resolution, or
negotiation styles, within this framework:




         Figure 1 - Negotiation Styles (Source: TechnologyConnect)



                                                                     Page 11 of 22
www.PDHcenter.com               PDH Course P199               www.PDHonline.org


Negotiation styles vary with the person, their beliefs and skills, as well as
the general context in which they occur. Here are five different styles
considered from different viewpoints.


1. Competing (I win – You lose)

Competing is assertive and uncooperative, a power-oriented mode. This
style of negotiation is best described as competitive and is one of the most
used styles in negotiating. Negotiators using this style are looking out for
their own needs, asking themselves ‘what do I need to get from this
discussion / process?’. Competitive negotiators have strong instincts for all
aspects of negotiating and are often strategic. They use a variety of tactics
to get what they want. Because their style can dominate the bargaining
process, competitive negotiators often neglect the importance of
relationships.

Competing style is appropriate if your power balance is high, you have a
good Plan B and you think he needs you more than you need him. This style
is most effective when results are needed quickly, or you are certain there is
no room for negotiation. Good examples of this style are buying a new car or
a lawyer representing their client or commodity based selling.


2. Accommodating (I Lose – You Win)

This style of negotiation is all about the relationship and is the polar opposite
of the Competing style. Accommodating negotiators believe that the only
way to ultimately get what they want is to satisfy all the demands of the
other party, hoping maybe in time the other party will do the same.
Accommodators are sensitive to the emotional states, body language, and
verbal signals of the other parties. They can, however, feel taken advantage
of in situations when the other party places little emphasis on the
relationship. This style, is naturally, well-liked by the opposite party.

Examples of this style are when a person injures another person and
willingly offers to pay all medical expenses hoping the injured party does not
sue.




                                                                       Page 12 of 22
www.PDHcenter.com              PDH Course P199               www.PDHonline.org


3. Avoiding (I Lose – You Lose)

Individuals who do not like or do not wish to negotiate often resort to this
style. They don't negotiate unless warranted. When negotiating, avoiders
tend to defer and dodge the confrontational aspects of negotiating; however,
they may be perceived as tactful and diplomatic. Avoiding is the strongest
position of all — the other side has to make concessions just to get the
process started.

An example of this style is two co-workers who cannot agree on the delivery
of a project and avoid communicating with each other but happily talk to
other co-workers about it!

In some cases, users of this style are unassertive and uncooperative
because of their personality. They do not immediately pursue their own
concerns or the other parties nor do they ever address the conflict. This style
could be a vengeful style and while the adopters of this style won’t address
the conflict they will seek ways of retribution. When this occurs, the avoiding
style can be difficult to spot as it can go under cover for a time; it escalates
to a ‘passive aggressive style’. This style is usually in response to a highly
competitive style. The avoider will shut down communication and contact
and will seemingly disappear off the radar. While this is in play, mutual
resentment builds and cracks to total breakdown of the relationship may
occur, leading to a lose-lose scenario.


4. Compromising (I Lose / Win Some – You Lose/ Win Some)

The old adage ‘pick your battles’ applies here. This style values the
relationship and acknowledges that there is a loss but it is better to
compromise then completely lose. A compromising style results in both
parties getting more or less half of what they originally wanted. This style is
common when the negotiating parties have a high level of trust between
each other and are time poor.

Compromisers are individuals who are eager to close the deal by doing what
is fair and equal for all parties involved in the negotiation. They can be
useful when there is limited time to complete the deal; however,
compromisers often unnecessarily rush the negotiation process and make
concessions too quickly. This style should not be confused with Collaborating
(I win – You win).
                                                                      Page 13 of 22
www.PDHcenter.com               PDH Course P199                www.PDHonline.org


5. Collaborating (I Win – You Win)

Collaborative negotiators are innovators! They recognize that both parties
have needs that must be met and take the time to find creative solutions to
this common conundrum. Collaborators are good at using negotiations to
understand the concerns and interests of the other parties. In business, this
style of negotiating is often seen as the “Holy Grail”.

Collaboration is great when both parties have the power to implement a
truly Win-Win business plan. When both sides are strong and both want the
deal, then collaboration is possible. Most business to business negotiators
plan for this type of negotiation. Some organizations are well known for their
collaborative style of negotiating. A good example of this style is Toyota
Motor Company which is known for being completely focused on a
collaborative approach to working with their suppliers resulting in greater
commitment and cooperation and well built cars!

It needs to be recognized that this style of negotiating is somewhat
wonderful ideological and is the most challenging to effect because in reality
it is high on resources and time. It can, in some instances, create problems
by transforming simple situations into more complex ones.

                                       **

The above negotiation styles are also referred to as conflict-handling modes.
All five styles are useful in different situations. Each of us is capable of using
all five negotiation styles. None of us can be characterized as having a single
style of dealing with conflict. But certain people use some styles better than
others and, therefore, tend to rely on those styles more heavily than
others—whether because of our temperament (nature) or because of our
upbringing (nurture).

So if you ever wonder “which is the best negotiation style?”,
the answer is “It depends.” Your negotiation style will be
the product of both your personal predispositions and the
requirements of the situation in which you find yourself.
Most people choose the style that is likely to reward them
with either the quickest conflict resolution or the biggest
profit prize.

Types of Negotiators

Three basic kinds of negotiators have been identified by researchers involved
in The Harvard Negotiation Project. These types of negotiators are: Soft
bargainers, hard bargainers, and principled bargainers.


1. Soft Bargainers

These people see negotiation as too close to competition, so they choose a
gentle style of bargaining. The offers they make are not in their best
interests, they yield to others' demands, avoid confrontation, and they
maintain good relations with fellow negotiators. Their perception of others is
one of friendship, and their goal is agreement. They do not separate the
people from the problem, but are soft on both. They avoid contests of wills
and will insist on agreement, offering solutions and easily trusting others and
changing their opinions.


2. Hard Bargainers

These people use contentious strategies to influence, utilizing phrases such
as "this is my final offer" and "take it or leave it." They make threats, are
distrustful of others, insist on their position, and apply pressure to negotiate.
They see others as adversaries and their ultimate goal is victory.
Additionally, they will search for one single answer, and insist you agree on
it. They do not separate the people from the problem (as with soft
bargainers), but they are hard on both the people involved and the problem.


3. Principled Bargainers

Individuals who bargain this way seek integrative solutions, and do so by
sidestepping commitment to specific positions. They focus on the problem
rather than the intentions, motives, and needs of the people involved. They
separate the people from the problem, explore interests, avoid bottom lines,
and reach results based on standards (which are independent of personal
will). They base their choices on objective criteria rather than power,
pressure, self-interest, or an arbitrary decisional procedure. These criteria
may be drawn from moral standards, principles of fairness, professional
standards, tradition, and so on.

Glossary

This glossary covers terms that are unique to the negotiating field, both
acronyms and slang. It also covers terms that are commonly used in
business, communication, law and other fields, and provides a definition of
how that term is used in the negotiating context.

                                        **

Anchor Point - Generally your first offer in a negotiation. See Anchoring
below.

Anchoring - A tactic used to open bargaining outside your MDO (Most
Desired Outcome) so that when you move it appears as if you have
conceded much in the hopes of causing the other side to second-guess their
MDO and open at or near their goal, thus anchoring them at a lower opening
than justified by the circumstances.

Arbitrator - An unbiased and objective person agreed to by the parties to
decide the outcome of a dispute.

Authority - Authority to make the agreement. The primary question a
negotiator needs to ask is “How much authority do I want in this
negotiation.”

BATNA - Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement: Your back-up plan
that you are comfortable implementing if an agreement cannot be reached
at or above your LAA (Least Acceptable Agreement).

Bargaining - A distributive negotiation which generally is both competitive
and positional. Many times it involves a single issue like price. One party
usually tries to gain advantage over the other to gain the best possible
outcome.

Big Order Approach – A tactic that can be used sometimes to help identify
the sellers true cost, or the seller’s flexibility in reducing a quoted price. This
occurs when offered a price, the buyer asks “What if I double the order” or,
“What if I take all you have?”

Blind Spot - A missed opportunity or idea that one is not open to, not
because of a physical eyesight problem, but due to a lack of information,
perspective, intellect or emotional appeal.

                                                                         Page 16 of 22

Bluffing - A tactic in which one side pretends that they may do or agree to
something that they really have no intention of doing. To pretend to be in a
better position than one is.

Body Language – Non-verbal cues into the emotional state and feelings of
another person.

BPA - Best Possible Agreement: A collection of those choices that best
satisfy all stakeholders’ interests.

Brain Storming - Creative development of ideas to solve a problem without
judging the merit of the ideas.

Brinkmanship - To hold a high risk position in a negotiation where the
margin between success and failure is slim.

Buy-in - To get “buy-in” is to influence another person to agree, have
confidence in, or become vested in a particular strategy or solution.

Capitulate - To acquiesce to terms and conditions you previously resisted.

Cherry Picking - A tactic whereby the negotiator selects the parts of an
offer that they like and rejects the parts they don’t like. Use words of
dependency, like “contingent on,” in your proposals to defeat cherry picking.

Compromise - Each side concedes something of value and neither side gets
what they wanted.

Concession - Giving into something in order to reach an agreement.
Concession is sometimes used to indicate a one-sided move, where as a
“trade” or “exchange” describes that each side gave and received.

Consensus - When all parties agree to a term or condition.

Cooling Off Period - Build ‘cooling off periods’ into a negotiation when
emotions and power struggles become apparent. Both parties are better
served if each has time to reflect on their own needs and interests, and
positions – outside of the negotiating room.

Counteroffer - A new offer with different terms made in response to an
original offer, thereby rejecting the original offer.

Crunch - A response to an offer that does not come in the form of a counter
offer. It is designed to encourage the other party to move off its current
position, to make concessions, and ultimately generate creative solutions.
                                                                    Page 17 of 22

You should challenge all Crunches with an equally assertive or greater
Counter-Crunch.

Creative Concession - Ideas, suggestions and offers that satisfy the
interests of both parties to a negotiation. Any concession that has a
relatively low cost to one side but a relatively high value to the other side.
Creative concessions help you achieve a higher level of interest-based or
value-based bargaining through knowledge of the other party’s business,
concerns, challenges, and interests.

Defensive Deception - Justifying deceit of the other party based on your
expectation that they will do the same to you.

Direct Communication Style - Literal truthfulness and efficiency in
communication are highly valued and are to some extent a higher priority
than personal or political sensitivities, especially in a business setting.
Saying “No” or “I don’t know” is considered both honest and respectful of
the party. Examples of cultures that promote a direct communication style
include U.S. Americans, Australians, Germans and Anglo Canadians.

Distributed Negotiation - A negotiation in which the interests of each
party is in complete conflict. A gain to one side results in a loss to the other.
Also called Zero-Sum Negotiation or Win-Lose Negotiation. Distributed
Negotiation is also referred to as Distributed Bargaining.

Divide and Conquer – “Divide and Conquer” has two quite different
meanings. If referring to a multi-party negotiation, one side attempts to get
the other side arguing with one another to cause a breakdown in their
solidarity. This weakens their power and resolve. If referring to a complex,
multi-issue negotiation, it is often helpful to divide up the negotiation into its
various components; come to agreement on the simpler issues; and then
tackle the tougher issues. This can help pave a way to the final agreement.

Dry Well - Show that you have nothing left to give.

End-Run - Going around someone to achieve that which they are resisting,
and getting approval from another source with authority.

Escalation - A sudden rise in the intensity of disagreement between
negotiating parties; a sudden rise in the terms that was not expected.

Expressive Communication Style - Cultures with an expressive
communication style regard emotion as a natural part of the communication
process. A total lack of emotion in their counterparts may feel to them like a
lack of sincerity and trust. Examples of such cultures include Mediterranean,
Arab, and in some situations Russian and Latin America.

Fait Accompli - Literally, a thing finished; in slang, a done deal. Used by
negotiators to justify why they can’t make a desired change.

Haggling - Relentless bargaining over an issue for the sole purpose of
getting more/giving less, without concern for the relationship.

Hidden Agenda - An interest or goal that you want but that you don’t
reveal to the other side, and in fact want to prevent the other side from
learning.

High Ball / Low Ball - A tactic used to make an offer that is unreasonably
high or low for the purpose of seeing if the other side can be fooled into
paying/doing more/less than an informed negotiator would agree to.

Hot Buttons - The issues or ideas that are known to cause a person
consternation and likely to produce an emotional reaction.

Hypothetical - A technique whereby one party poses a fictional situation
that could exist but doesn’t, as a way to explore options or better
understand the limits of someone’s authority or willingness to offer
concessions.

Indirect Communication Style - Directly communicating negative
information is seen as impolite and crude, even in a business setting.
Instead polite excuses or evasions are given with recognition by both parties
that a diplomatic strategy is being employed. Examples of cultures that
employ an indirect communication style include Japanese, Chinese, Indians,
and Saudi Arabians.

Interests - A party’s goals, needs and desires, which underlie a party’s
demands or positions.

Integrative Negotiation - A negotiation in which the parties work together
to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement. Also known as win-win, interest-
based and value-based negotiation.

worth it to move forward with the solution or agreement, but anything less
than the LAA results in no agreement.

Leading Questions - A question that is designed to generate only one
possible answer.

Legitimacy - That which is authoritative, official, authentic. Examples

Magical (or mystical) Math - A tactic that uses numbers, financial
information, and other data points to justify a proposal where the analysis

other side, their interests and positions, to test assumptions, and see the
opportunities to create value. Used in the Bargaining Stage to develop
creative solutions that capture value.

Poker Face - Not using your face to show the emotion you feel inside,
whether it be anger, surprise, elation, fear, etc.

Position - A party’s demands – what they say they want - that are
supported by interests.

Puppy Dog - An old-school sales tactic used to entice interest by allowing
the buyer to try out the product or service and simply return it if they are
not satisfied. Unsure if you want to buy a puppy? Take it home and fall in
love, and see if you can bear to return it.

                                                                     Page 20 of 22

Red Herring - A tactic used to divert a party’s attention from the real issue
to something tangential or unrelated, allowing the diverting party to gain
some advantage.

Relationship-Oriented Culture - A cultural trait where emphasis is on
group opinions and not on one or two expert opinions. Mature judgment,

importance. Examples of relationship-oriented cultures include most of Latin
America, eastern and southern Europe, Africa and the Middle East, and
nearly all of Asia.

Reserved Communication Style - Cultures with a reserved communication
style feel that the open expression of emotion, even at a point of great
frustration or elation, is foolish, inappropriate, and immature. Examples of
such cultures include Chinese, Japanese, and to a degree the English and
northwestern Europeans.

RFI - Request for Information. Typically sent out by an organization when it
wants to buy a product or service but first needs to learn more about what is
available in the marketplace and which suppliers can best meet its needs.

RFP - Request for Proposals. Typically sent out by an organization that
knows the marketplace for the product or service it wishes to buy, using this
more formal process to learn how suppliers will respond to a specific set of
requirements.

RFQ - Request for Quotation. Often used by buyers and other purchasing
professionals when acquiring commodities where price will be the main
determining factor.

Stalling - A tactic that avoids reaching agreement by claiming without
justification the need for more time.

Stonewalling - Demonstrating by your actions or words that you are not
open to new solutions. Some negotiators stonewall to see if the other side
will capitulate.

Stakeholder - People and organizations that have a vested interest in the
outcome of the negotiation. They are rarely at the negotiating table, and are
often not directly involved at all.




                                                                    Page 21 of 22
