      Home: The place where you reside. Transportation expenses between your home and
      your main or regular place of work are personal commuting expenses.
      Regular or main job: Your principal place of business. If you have more than one job,
      you must determine which one is your regular or main job. Consider the time you
      spend at each, the activity you have at each, and the income you earn at each.
      Temporary work location: A place where your work assignment is realistically
      expected to last (and does in fact last) one year or less. Unless you have a regular
      place of business, you can only deduct your transportation expenses to a temporary
      work location outside your metropolitan area.
      Second job: If you regularly work at two or more places in one day, whether or not
      for the same employer, you can deduct your transportation expenses of getting from
      one workplace to another. If you don’t go directly from your first job to your second
      job, you can only deduct the transportation expenses of going directly from your first
      job to your second job. You can’t deduct your transportation expenses between
      your home and a second job on a day off from your main job.

 CAUTION
                    applies to you, determine: 1) the basis of all business property (including other cars) you placed in service after September of that
                    year, and 2) the basis of all business property you placed in service during that entire year. If the basis of the property placed in
                    service after September isn’t more than 40% of the basis of all property (certain property is excluded) placed in service for the entire
                    year, use the percentage for Jan. 1–Sept. 30 for figuring depreciation for your car. See Which Convention Applies? in chapter 4 of
                    Pub. 946 for more details.

Example. You buy machinery (basis of $32,000) in May 2024 and a new van (basis of $20,000) in October 2024, both used 100% in your business.
You use the percentage for Jan. 1–Sept. 30, 2024, to figure the depreciation for your van. This is because the $20,000 basis of the property (van)
placed in service after September isn’t more than 40% of the basis of all property placed in service during the year (40% (0.40) × ($32,000 + 20,000)
= $20,800).
