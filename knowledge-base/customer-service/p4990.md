*The first four positions of the FI Tax Code (as shown above) are the actual form you are filing in most cases. Example: If you wish to designate your
payment for a Form 941 penalty, you would place 94109 in the addenda field TXPO2. If you are paying an amount due on an IRS notice that includes
penalty or interest, it is not necessary to split the payment. Use tax type 94107 to pay the entire amount of a Form 941 notice.

**Those tax type codes ending in “7” include Installment Agreement payments.

‡ The tax period month must match the company’s fiscal year for these forms.
