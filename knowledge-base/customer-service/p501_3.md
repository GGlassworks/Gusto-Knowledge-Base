If your parent (or someone else) can claim you as a dependent, use this table to see if you must file a return.
In this table, unearned income includes taxable interest, ordinary dividends, and capital gain distributions. It also includes
unemployment compensation, taxable social security benefits, pensions, annuities, and distributions of unearned income from a
trust. Earned income includes salaries, wages, tips, professional fees, and taxable scholarship and fellowship grants. Gross income

 1
     A person can't qualify more than one taxpayer to use the head of household filing status for the year.
 2
  The term “qualifying child” is defined under Dependents, later. Note: If you are a noncustodial parent, the term “qualifying child” for head of
 household filing status doesn't include a child who is your qualifying child only because of the rules described under Children of divorced or
 separated parents (or parents who live apart) under Qualifying Child, later. If you are the custodial parent and those rules apply, the child is
 generally your qualifying child for head of household filing status even though the child isn't a qualifying child you can claim as a dependent.
 3
  This person is a qualifying person if the only reason you can't claim the person as a dependent is that you can be claimed as a dependent on
 another taxpayer's return.
 4
     The term “qualifying relative” is defined under Dependents, later.
 5
  If you can claim a person as a dependent only because of a multiple support agreement, that person isn't a qualifying person. See Multiple
 Support Agreement, later.

Table 5. Overview of the Rules for Claiming a Dependent


      !          This table is only an overview of the rules. For details, see the rest of this publication.
 CAUTION


     • You can't claim any dependents if you, or your spouse if filing jointly, could be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer,
          unless that taxpayer files a return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid.

     • You can't claim a married person who files a joint return as a dependent unless that joint return is filed only to claim a refund of
          withheld income tax or estimated tax paid.

     • You can't claim a person as a dependent unless that person is a U.S. citizen, a U.S. resident alien, a U.S. national, or a resident
          of Canada or Mexico.1

     • You can't claim a person as a dependent unless that person is your qualifying child or qualifying relative.

     5. The child must not be filing a joint return for the year (unless that joint
        return is filed only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated
        tax paid).

 person, generally only one person can actually treat the child as a
 qualifying child. See Qualifying Child of More Than One Person, later,
 to find out which person is the person entitled to claim the child as a
 qualifying child.
