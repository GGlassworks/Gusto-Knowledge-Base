   A person can’t qualify more than one taxpayer to use the head of household filing status for the year.
 2
   See Table 3 for the tests that must be met to be a qualifying child. Note. If you’re a noncustodial parent, the term “qualifying child” for head of
     household filing status doesn’t include a child who is your qualifying child only because of the rules described under Children of Divorced or
     Separated Parents (or Parents Who Live Apart) under Qualifying Child, later. If you’re the custodial parent and those rules apply, the child is
     generally your qualifying child for head of household filing status even though you can’t claim the child as a dependent.
 3
   This person is a qualifying person if the only reason you can’t claim them as a dependent is because you can be claimed as a dependent on
     someone else's return.
 4
   See Table 3 for the tests that must be met to be a qualifying relative.

   If you can claim a person as a dependent only because of a multiple support agreement, that person isn’t a qualifying person. See Multiple Support

 •    You can’t claim any dependents if you, or your spouse if filing jointly, could be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer
      unless that taxpayer files a return only to claim a refund of withheld income tax or estimated tax paid.
 •    You can’t claim a married person who files a joint return as a dependent unless that joint return is filed only to claim a refund of
      withheld income tax or estimated tax paid.
 •    You can’t claim a person as a dependent unless that person is a U.S. citizen, U.S. resident alien, U.S. national, or a resident of
      Canada or Mexico.1
