 Note. Complete a separate worksheet for each separate limit income category.


 STEP I
 Figure the estimated tax on U.S. source income in the separate limit income category using U.S. rules for determining the source of income.
      Lines 1–7 Enter the gross amount for each type of income in column A, and the net amount in column B.
      Line 9 Enter the amounts from Form 1040 or 1040-SR, line 16, and Schedule 2 (Form 1040), line 1z, less any decrease in tax reported on
      Form 8978, line 14.


 STEP II
 Determine the amount of tax that the United States is allowed to collect at source under the treaty on income in the separate limit income category of
 residents of the other country who are not U.S. citizens. (In most cases, this amount should be claimed, to the extent allowable, as a foreign tax
 credit on your foreign tax return.)
      PART A Income in the separate limit income category fully taxable by the United States. In most cases, this includes income from a U.S. trade
      or business and gains from dispositions of U.S. real property. Identify the type and amount on line 13a.
      PART B Income in the separate limit income category for which treaty limits U.S. tax at source. This may include dividends, interest, royalties,
      and certain pensions.
      Lines 14 and 15 Identify each type and amount of income. Use the specified treaty rate. (The current treaty rates are available at IRS.gov/
      Individuals/International-Taxpayers/Tax-Treaty-Tables.)
      PART C Identify the items in the separate limit income category not taxable at source by the United States under the treaty.


 STEP III
 Figure the amount of the additional credit for foreign taxes paid or accrued on U.S. source income. The additional credit is limited to the difference
 between the estimated U.S. tax (Step I) and the greater of the allowable U.S. tax at source (Step II) or the foreign tax credit allowed by the residence
 country (line 18).
      Line 17 Enter the amount of the residence country tax on your U.S. source income before reduction for foreign tax credits. If possible, use the
      fraction of the pre-credit residence country tax which U.S. source taxable income bears to total taxable income. Otherwise, report that fraction
      of the pre-credit foreign tax which gross U.S. income bears to total gross income for foreign tax purposes.
      Line 21 This amount may be claimed as a foreign tax credit on Form 1116. First, add this amount to the reduction in foreign taxes on Part III,
      line 12, and complete Form 1116 according to the instructions. Add this amount as an additional credit to Form 1116, Part IV, line 32, as well
      and report that total on your Form 1040 or 1040-SR. File this worksheet with your Form 1040 or 1040-SR as an attachment to Form 1116.
