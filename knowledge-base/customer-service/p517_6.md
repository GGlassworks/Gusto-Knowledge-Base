 ** Gross income means all income you received in the form of money, goods, property, and services that isn't exempt from tax, including any income from
    sources outside the United States or from the sale of your main home (even if you can exclude part or all of it). Don’t include any social security benefits
    unless (a) you are married filing a separate return and you lived with your spouse at any time in 2024, or (b) one-half of your social security benefits plus your
    other gross income and any tax-exempt interest is more than $25,000 ($32,000 if married filing jointly). If (a) or (b) applies, see the instructions for Form
    1040, lines 6a and 6b, to figure the taxable part of social security benefits you must include in gross income. Gross income includes gains, but not losses,
    reported on Form 8949 or Schedule D (Form 1040). Gross income from a business means, for example, the amount on Schedule C (Form 1040), line 7; or
    Schedule F (Form 1040), line 9. But, in figuring gross income, don't reduce your income by any losses, including any loss on Schedule C (Form 1040),
    line 7; or Schedule F (Form 1040), line 9.
 *** If you didn't live with your spouse at the end of 2024 (or on the date your spouse died) and your gross income was at least $5, you must file a return
    regardless of your age.
