Source of Income

Introduction
After you have determined your alien status, you must de-
termine the source of your income. This chapter will help
you determine the source of different types of income you
may receive during the tax year.

Topics
This chapter discusses:

 • Income source rules, and
 • Community income.
This chapter also discusses special rules for married indi-
viduals who are domiciled in a country with community
property laws.


Resident Aliens
A resident alien's income is generally subject to tax in the
same manner as a U.S. citizen. If you are a resident alien,
you must report all interest, dividends, wages, or other
compensation for services; income from rental property or
royalties; and other types of income on your U.S. tax re-
turn. You must report these amounts from sources within
and outside the United States.
