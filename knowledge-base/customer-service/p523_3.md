B) Complete this section only if you have determined that you aren’t eligible for the maximum exclusion but
are eligible for a partial exclusion. If you are eligible for a partial exclusion, use this section to determine
your exclusion limit.
Step 1        Determine the shortest of the following 3 periods:
              1. Your time of residence in the home during the 5-year period leading up to the sale . . . .
              2. Your time of ownership of the home leading up to the sale . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
              3. The time that has elapsed between the sale and the date you last sold a home for which
              you took the exclusion, if applicable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Step 2        Take the smallest period from Step 1 (you may use days or months) and divide that number
              by 730 (if using days) or 24 (if using months) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Step 3        Multiply the result from Step 2 by $250,000. This is the amount of your reduced exclusion.

Step 4        Repeat Steps 1–3 for your spouse and add the two results                                   ............................
C) Your exclusion limit is $___________. Only gain in excess of this amount is taxable, unless you have gain from

        • If the number is negative (adjusted basis is greater than amount realized), you sold your
           home at a loss. You can’t deduct this loss, but you don’t need to pay any tax on the money
           you received from selling your home. Skip to Reporting Your Home Sale, later.
        • If the number is positive, you sold your home at a gain. Skip to How Much Is Taxable,
           later, to see if Worksheet 3 is required.
      If this is your separate worksheet for business use, don’t follow guidance on line 7. Report the
      gain on Form 4797 because this gain is not excluded under section 121.

Enter any depreciation reported on line 5a of the Business or Rental Worksheet in Section A of Worksheet 3. Worksheet
2 allocated a separate portion of the property used for Business or Rental, if any, to figure the amount of gain potentially
excluded under section 121. Worksheet 3 helps you figure how much of the gain calculated in Worksheet 2 will be exclu-
ded under section 121 based on whether you, your spouse, or a former spouse used the entire property as your principal
residence or for another purpose like for rental use or as a second home, or vacation home.

 Section B. Determine your nonqualified use gain. Complete this section only if the following apply: a) During
 the time you owned the property there were periods of nonqualified use when neither you nor your spouse
 (or your former spouse) used the entire property as your main home; b) the periods of nonqualified use
 occurred after 2008; c) the periods of nonqualified use occurred before the last day the entire property was
 used as your or your spouse’s (or your former spouse) main home prior to the date of sale. Do not include
 any period of nonqualified use that occurred after the last day that you or your spouse (or former spouse)
 used the entire property as your main home during the 5-year period prior to the date of sale.* Otherwise,
 skip to Section C.
 *Note. If the period of non-use was 1) for an aggregate of 2 years or less and due to a change in employment, a health
 condition, or other "unforeseen circumstance" described in Does Your Home Qualify for a Partial Exclusion of Gain,
 earlier; or 2) for 10 years or less and due to a "stop the clock" exception for certain military, intelligence, and Peace
 Corps personnel described in Service, Intelligence, and Peace Corps Personnel, earlier, then you may skip Section B.

                    neither you nor your spouse (or former spouse) used the entire home as a
                    main residence. Do not include any days that occurred after the last day that
                    you or your spouse (or former spouse) used the entire property as your main
                    home during the 5-year period prior to the date of sale. This number is your
