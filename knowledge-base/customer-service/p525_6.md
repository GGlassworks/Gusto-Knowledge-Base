 To determine whether you should complete this worksheet to figure the part of a recovery amount to include in income on your 2024
 tax return, see Itemized Deduction Recoveries. You generally don't need to use this worksheet if you file Form 1040 or 1040-SR and
 the recovery is for state or local income taxes paid for the immediately preceding tax year. If you recovered amounts from more than
 1 year, such as a state income tax refund from 2023 and a casualty loss reimbursement from 2022, complete a separate worksheet
 for each year. Use information from your tax return for the year the expense was deducted.

 A recovery is included in income only to the extent of the deduction amount that reduced your tax in the prior year (year of the
 deduction). If you were subject to the AMT or your tax credits reduced your tax to zero, see Unused tax credits and Subject to AMT
 under Itemized Deduction Recoveries. If your recovery was for an itemized deduction that was limited, you should read Itemized
 deductions limited under Itemized Deduction Recoveries.
