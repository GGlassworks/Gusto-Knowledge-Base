                            Deductions for a Dwelling Unit
                            Used as a Home                                                                                 Keep for Your Records
Caution. Use the percentage determined in Part I, line F, to figure the rental portions to enter on lines 2a–2c, 4a–4c, and 6a–6b of Part II.
Line 2a.   If you are claiming the standard deduction, do not report an amount on line 2a; instead, report the rental portion of your
           mortgage interest on line 4b.
           If you are itemizing your deductions on Schedule A, figure the amount of mortgage interest to include on line 2a by using the
           following steps.
           Step 1. Treat all the mortgage interest you paid for mortgages secured by your home(s) as a personal expense and figure the
           amount that would be deductible as an itemized expense on Schedule A. See Pub. 936 for more information about figuring the
           home mortgage interest deduction and the limits that may apply.
           Step 2. Include on line 2a the rental portion of deductible mortgage interest figured in Step 1 that is attributable to the home you
           are renting.
           Note. Be sure to claim only the personal portion of your deductible mortgage interest on Schedule A. The personal portion of
           mortgage interest on the dwelling unit doesn't include the rental portion you reported on line 2a of this Worksheet 5-1 or any
           portion that you deducted on other forms, such as Schedule C or F.
Line 2b.   If you are claiming the standard deduction, do not report an amount on line 2b; instead, report the rental portion of your real
           estate taxes on line 4c.
           If you are itemizing your deductions on Schedule A, figure the amount to report on line 2b by using the following steps.
           Step 1. If the total of your state and local income (or, if elected on your Schedule A, general sales) taxes, real estate taxes, and
           personal property taxes is not more than $10,000 ($5,000 if married filing separately), enter the rental portion of the real estate
           taxes attributable to the dwelling unit you are renting on line 2b.
           Step 2. If you do not meet the condition of Step 1, use the following worksheet to figure the amount to include on line 2b.
           Line 2b Worksheet
                 1. Enter your state and local income taxes (or, if you elect on Schedule A, your state and

               10. Excess real estate taxes reported on line 4c. Subtract line 9 from line 6 . . . . . . . . . .
            Note. Be sure to report only the personal portion of your real estate taxes on line 5b of Schedule A. The personal
           portion of real estate taxes on the dwelling unit doesn't include the rental portion you reported on line 2b of this
           Worksheet 5-1 or any portion that you deducted on other forms, such as Schedule C or F.

Line 2c.   If you are claiming the standard deduction and you are not increasing your standard deduction by a net qualified disaster loss,
           do not report an amount on line 2c; instead, report the rental portion of your casualty losses on line 6a.
           If you are itemizing your deductions on Schedule A or filing a Schedule A to increase your standard deduction by a net qualified
           disaster loss, figure the amount to report on line 2c by using the following steps.
           Step 1. Complete a worksheet version of Section A of Form 4684 treating all your casualty losses (and gains) as personal
           expenses. If you are itemizing your deductions, when completing line 17 of this worksheet version of Form 4684, enter 10% of
           your adjusted gross income figured without your rental income and expenses from the dwelling unit. Don't file this worksheet
           version of Form 4684; instead, keep it for your records. You will complete a separate Form 4684 to attach to your return using
           only the personal portion of your casualty losses (and gains) for Section A.
           Step 2. Include on line 2c the rental portion of the loss amounts from lines 15 and 18 of this worksheet version of Form 4684 that
           are the result of a federally declared disaster. If you are claiming an increased standard deduction instead of itemizing your
           deductions, only use the rental portion of a net qualified disaster loss on line 15 of the worksheet version of Form 4684 for this
           Step 2.
              Note. Be sure to use only the personal portion of your casualty losses (and gains) when completing Section A of the separate
           Form 4684 you attach to your return. The separate Form 4684 you attach to your return is used to figure the casualty losses you
           can include on line 15 of Schedule A and the net qualified disaster losses you can include on line 16 of Schedule A. You will
           report casualty and theft losses attributable to your rental activity in Section B of the separate Form 4684 you attach to your
           return.

Worksheet 5-1 Instructions—Continued
Line 2d.     Enter the total of your rental expenses that are directly related only to the rental activity. These include interest on loans used for
             rental activities other than to buy, build, or improve the dwelling unit. Also, include rental agency fees, advertising, office
             supplies, and depreciation on office equipment used in your rental activity.
Line 2e.     You can deduct the amounts on lines 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d as rental expenses even if your rental expenses are more than your
             rental income. Enter the amounts on lines 2a, 2b, and 2d on the appropriate lines of Schedule E. Include the amount from
             line 2c with the casualty loss from line 6e, if any, in Section B of Form 4684, on line 27, and enter “See attached statement”
             above line 27. Attach a statement to your tax return showing how you calculated the deductible loss (you can use the worksheet
             as your attachment).

Line 4b.     If you are claiming the standard deduction, enter the rental portion of all the home mortgage interest paid for loans used to buy,
             build, or substantially improve the dwelling unit you are renting on line 4b. Do not include mortgage interest on a loan that did not
             benefit the dwelling unit (for example, a home equity loan used to pay off credit card bills, to buy a car, or to pay tuition costs).

             If you are itemizing your deductions and the amount you figured in Step 1 under Line 2a was less than the full amount of interest
             you paid because of the limits on deducting home mortgage interest as a personal expense, include on line 4b the rental portion
             of the excess attributable to the loans used to buy, build, or substantially improve the dwelling unit you rented.

Line 4c.     If you are claiming the standard deduction, enter the rental portion of all the real estate taxes paid on the dwelling unit you
             rented.

             If you are itemizing your deductions and you used the Line 2b Worksheet to figure the amount to include on line 2b, then include
             the amount from line 10 of the Line 2b Worksheet on line 4c; otherwise, do not enter an amount on line 4c.

Line 4f.     You can deduct the amounts on lines 4a, 4b, 4c, and 4d as rental expenses on Schedule E only to the extent they aren’t more
             than the amount on line 4f.*

Line 6a.     If you are claiming the standard deduction and not increasing it by a net qualified disaster loss, enter the rental portion of all
             casualty losses attributable to the dwelling unit you rented.
             If you are itemizing your deductions on Schedule A or filing a Schedule A to increase your standard deduction by a net qualified
             disaster loss, enter the rental portion of the casualty losses attributable to the dwelling unit you rented that are in excess of the
             amount you figured on lines 15 and 18 of your worksheet version of Form 4684.

Line 6e.     You can deduct the amounts on lines 6a, 6b, and 6c as rental expenses only to the extent they aren’t more than the amount on
             line 6e.* Include the depreciation from line 6e, if any, on the appropriate line of Schedule E. Include the casualty loss from
             line 6e, if any, with the casualty loss from line 2c in Section B of Form 4684, on line 27, and enter “See attached statement”
             above line 27. Attach a statement to your tax return showing how you calculated the deductible loss (you can use the worksheet
             as your attachment).

* Allocating the limited deduction. If you can’t deduct all of the amount on line 4e or 6d this year, you can allocate the allowable deduction in any way you wish
among the expenses included on line 4e or 6d. Enter the amount you allocate to each expense on the appropriate line of Schedule E, Part I, or if a casualty loss, as
