INTRODUCTION
1.1          WELCOME TO EFTPS
The Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS) is a free service of the U.S. Department of the
Treasury. The system has been in use since 1996, with millions of businesses and individual
taxpayers and thousands of tax professionals making payments through channels, including
EFTPS.gov, a voice response system, and the batch provider software.

2.1    INSTALLING EFTPS BATCH PROVIDER SOFTWARE
 Please Note: For Windows to install the Batch Provider Client correctly, it must be executed
 as an Administrator. If you do not have administrative privileges, please contact your system
 administrator.

 1. Go to EFTPS.gov and click Help and Information.

 2. Select Downloads, Software.

 3. Scroll to System Requirements and click the correct “Download” link for your operating
    system.

 4. Click “Download” again.

 5. Click “Run.”

 6. Click “Run” again.

 7. On the Install Anywhere Introduction window, click “Next.”

 8. Accept the license agreement and click “Next.”

 9. Select the default C: Folder Path and click “Next.”

 10. Review the database security information and click “Next.”

 11. Select Single User and click “Next.”

 12. Create User Name and Password (both case sensitive).

 13. Click “Install.”




                                                      10                                     INSTALLATION AND SETUP
2.2     RUNNING ON A NETWORK ENVIRONMENT
  1. Install the software on the server first.

  2. Install the software on the computers that network through the server.

  3. If you need to use a proxy server to connect outside of a firewall, you must place the proxy
     server address in one of the batch provider software files on your hard drive. Contact your
     Network Administrator to obtain the specific proxy server address, port, and any realm, user
     name, or password information. (see Appendix D)

  Precaution

  The application must not be started more than once on a particular server.

  To control this, set the File Permissions on the BatchProvider.exe file to allow only one user
  (or a controlled set of users) to have execute permissions on the server installation. This will
  prevent unauthorized or accidental start-up of the application. A controlled set of users would
  need to coordinate start-up of the application so that it is only started once at any given time.




2.3     LAUNCHING THE SOFTWARE
  1. Log on using the Administrator’s User ID and Password.

  2. Click the User Administration tab to create any other roles and User IDs. (see Section 7)


2.3.1 Setting the Database Passwords
Upon installation of the Batch Provider software, the administrator must set the
values for the database admin password and the database encryption
password. These values must be updated subsequently every 13 months. You
will receive warning prompts to update these passwords once they are within 60
days of expiration.
1. Navigate to “Administration” > “Set Database Passwords” to update the
admin and encryption passwords.
        Note – If the database admin and encryption passwords have not been
        set or if they have expired, you will be prompted to update these
        passwords before any users are able to proceed within the application.
2. Specify values for the database admin and database encryption passwords.
Each password value must comply with the following:
  - Must be between 12 and 30 characters in length
  - Must contain at least 1 upper-case letter (A, B, C, etc.)
  - Must contain at least 1 lower-case letter (a, b, c, etc.)
  - Must contain at least 1 number (1, 2, 3, etc.)
  - Must contain at least 1 of the following special characters (!, @, #, $, *, +, -)
  - Must not contain double characters (no 2 consecutive characters can be the
same value)
  - Must not be the same as any of the 5 previous passwords used
3. Click “Update.”




                                                           11                                   INSTALLATION AND SETUP
The database admin and encryption passwords are changed immediately and
the database will be re-encrypted.


2.3.2 To use this software with a new registration
 1. Start the application and log on using the Administrator’s User ID and Password.

 2. Click the Registration tab and follow the steps to create a new Registration. (See Section 4.1)

 An error message is displayed if required information is left blank or a discrepancy is found. The
 message will describe the error and provide instructions for correcting the error.




3.5      INTERPRETING STATUSES
 Each Registration, Enrollment, and Payment transaction is assigned a status. The status appears on
 the summary listings on the Registration, Enrollments, and Payments tabs.


3.5.1 Registration and enrollment statuses
 • Active—the transaction has been completed, submitted to EFTPS, accepted, and processed.

 • Inactive—the transaction has been archived and is not currently active. This applies to
      enrollments only.

 • Pending—the transaction has been completed, submitted to EFTPS, and accepted but not
      processed.

 • Pending Error—the transaction has been completed, submitted to EFTPS, and is pending
      but has an error. To correct the error, select the applicable Registration and click “Edit”; or,
      for enrollments, select the applicable enrollment and click “View.”

 • Pending Terminate—the enrollment has been selected to be terminated, submitted to
      EFTPS, and accepted but not processed. This applies to enrollments only.

 • Rejected—the transaction has been completed and submitted to EFTPS but has been
      rejected.

 • Submitted—the transaction has been completed and submitted to EFTPS but is not yet
      accepted or processed by EFTPS.

 • Terminated—the enrollment has been selected to be terminated, submitted to EFTPS,
      accepted, and processed. The enrollment is removed permanently from the EFTPS
      system.

 • Suspended—the enrollment has been suspended because Shared Secrets information
      required by the Third Party Authorization disclosure was not provided. Payments that were
      made for this enrollment before the suspension will be processed, but no new payments
      can be made for an enrollment that is in a suspended status.

      edited.

  •   Rejected—the payment was submitted to EFTPS and was rejected. The payment can be edited

5.1.2 Disclosure authorization
 Select the authorization you will have on file for this taxpayer. If you have a Third-Party
 Authorization on file, you must complete the Shared Secrets information at the bottom of the page.

 Each taxpayer for whom you will be submitting payments is required to provide authorization
 permitting the batch provider to exchange information with the IRS. An electronic Third-Party
 Authorization may be completed during this enrollment, which will generate an EFTPS Individual
 Enrollment with Third-Party Authorization, Form 9783T. This authorization requires a five-digit,
 self-selected Signature PIN. The taxpayer’s date of birth and prior year’s adjusted gross income
 must be provided for authentication. This electronic authorization will be transmitted to EFTPS.

       supplied in your batch provider registration

     cannot make payments using the batch provider software. Contact your financial institution
     for assistance with making payments through the credit method.

5.1.5 Optional tax form limits
 You can set amount limits for a client’s tax forms.

 For example: If a client’s Form 941 payment usually does not exceed $5,000, you might enter
 that as a limit. When making a Form 941 payment for that client, a warning message will
 appear if the payment exceeds $5,000. You can:

 1. Abandon the payment.

 2. Override the amount limit warnings and proceed with payment.

 3. Change the limits by editing the taxpayer’s enrollment record and submitting the change to
    EFTPS. (see Section 5.2)

  PIN for multiple clients. The Enrollment PIN must be four numbers and cannot be 0000 or 9999.

• If you do not enter a PIN, the system will generate one for you.

  As part of the taxpayer enrollment, the system will auto-generate an inquiry PIN for your client.

  cancel payments.

• EFTPS will send your client a unique mailing:
        − Explaining the reasons for receiving the Inquiry PIN letter and the ability to view
             payment history online or by phone.
             −   Including a PIN letter and instructions on how to obtain an Internet Password.

         •       To obtain an Internet Password, clients will call 1.800.982.3526.

         •       Clients should have their PIN letter available when they call to enter:

             −   Taxpayer Identification Number (EIN or SSN)

             −   PIN
             −   Last eight numbers of the Enrollment Number

NOTE
If the enrollment requires third-party authorization, the 9783T form will be
presented for printing and signing after this step.

GLOSSARY
•   ACH Trace Number—Unique number found on every EFTPS debit payment.

•   Administrator’s User ID and Password—ID and Password you create when you install the software.
    These are the keys for administering the software, not for sending or receiving information from
    EFTPS.

•   Archive—You can archive—or make inactive—enrollments within your database. This allows you to
    refine enrollment and payment reports, because inactive enrollments will not be displayed on the
    normal inquiry search results. Inactive enrollments can be made Active again (and used immediately).
    The Active/Inactive status is only a designation of an enrollment within your batch provider software
    and does not affect the enrollment’s status with EFTPS

    Note: Enrollments with outstanding payments (either New or Submitted) cannot be archived. Archived
    enrollments will not display; however, the PIN will remain active until the enrollment is terminated..

•   Database Admin Password—Password associated with a local database admin account that is used by the
    Batch Provider software to interact with the locally installed database.

•   Database Encryption Password—Password that serves as the encryption key associated with the local
    Batch Provider database and is used to encrypt its stored data.

•   EFT Number—Unique Electronic Funds Transfer number assigned to payments and cancellations for
    tracking purposes. This number is your receipt for the transaction.

•   EIN—Employer Identification Number. Unique nine-digit number assigned by the IRS and used to
    identify a business taxpayer.

•   Email Notification—Receiving email messages is optional. After you send enrollments or payments to
    EFTPS, the system will respond with a secure email with the status of your file (accepted or rejected).
    You can enter up to three email addresses during Registration.

•   Enrollment PIN—Every enrollment has a unique Personal Identification Number (PIN) for added
    security. The PIN can be self-selected or you can choose to have EFTPS assign a PIN. A PIN must
    be four numbers, cannot be 0000 or 9999, and cannot duplicate another TIN/PIN combination within
    the system.

•   Express Registration—Is available only if you have an existing batch provider Registration or an
    EFTPS online enrollment. Express Registration allows you to generate a new Registration using the
    name and TIN of an existing EFTPS online enrollment or batch provider Registration.

•   Internet Password—If you want a client to be able to view his or her payment history at EFTPS.gov,
    you will need to request that a Taxpayer Inquiry PIN be sent to the client. After receiving that PIN, the
    client will go to EFTPS.gov and create an additional credential, an Internet password.

•   Master Account—You can choose to make payments for clients from a single Master Bank Account
    that you maintain.

•   Master Password— The Master Password is used with your Registration ID and Master PIN so you
    can send and receive EFTPS transactions securely. Master Passwords must be 12–30 characters
    long, containing at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, one special
    character (!, @, #, $, *, +, -), and no repeating characters, and cannot be the same as any of the five
    previous passwords used.

•   Master PIN—A four-digit Personal Identification Number assigned by EFTPS and used with the
    Master Password to protect your batch provider account. You are responsible for protecting the
    Master PIN. Do not give this information to anyone and store any references to this PIN in a secure
    location. A PIN must be four numbers and cannot be 0000 or 9999.

•   Registration Authorization Information—Window that appears before you send information to EFTPS.
    It asks for your Registration ID, Master PIN, and Master Password. By entering this information, you
    are authorizing the transaction.

•   Role—The software provides three predefined roles (“Admin,” “Manager,” and “User”) and that each
    has a specific level of responsibilities and authority.

•   RTN—Routing Transit Number. A unique nine-digit bank identification number that is part of every
    ACH transaction and identifies a specific financial institution.

•   SSN—Social Security Number. The unique nine-digit taxpayer identification number assigned to an
    individual taxpayer by the IRS.

•   Settlement Date—Business date on which funds are withdrawn from the designated bank account.
    Payments must be scheduled by 8 p.m. ET at least one calendar day before the settlement date.

•   Submit—When you provide information to EFTPS through the software and a secure Internet
    connection.

•   Sync—When you receive current enrollment and payment information from EFTPS through a secure
    Internet connection.

•   Taxpayer Inquiry PIN—Four-digit Personal Identification Number assigned and sent to an enrolled
    taxpayer. The Inquiry PIN, along with an Internet password, allows clients to check their payment
    history. They cannot make or cancel payments.

•   Threshold Amount—When you enroll a client, you can choose to set payment dollar amount limits for
    each of the client’s tax types. When you make a payment for that client and tax type, the system will
    compare your payment amount against your stated limit and provide a warning if you exceed the limit.
    You can choose to override the warning.

•   TIN—Taxpayer Identification Number. Nine-digit Employer Identification Number (EIN) for a business
    or nine-digit Social Security Number (SSN) for an individual. The TIN is assigned by the IRS.

•   User—A person designated to use the software by the Administrator.

•   User ID—The description or nickname of a person using the software.

•   VRS—Voice Response System. The automated telephone system used to obtain a Password.

APPENDIX D HOW TO APPLY PROXY SETTINGS
File Configuration:

If you need to use a proxy server to connect outside of a firewall, you must place the proxy server
address in one of the EFTPS batch provider software files on your hard drive. Contact your
Network Administrator to obtain the specific proxy server address, port, and any realm, user name,
or password information.

Application File System:

1. Obtain the following property values from your Network Administrator:

a. Proxy Host Name

b. Proxy Port

2. Determine whether your network requires the following and obtain the proper values:

a. Proxy Realm

b. Proxy Username

c. Proxy Password

Application Properties file

1. Close the EFTPS batch provider application while modifying the file.

2. Open the application.properties file in the applicable location:

a. For all platforms except Windows Vista and Windows 7: APPLICATION_HOME\conf directory
        (C:\Program Files\EFTPS batch provider Client\conf\application.properties)

b. For Windows Vista and Windows 7: The application.properties file is located in
   ProgramData EFTPS\BPClient\uniquely generated name\conf

3. Modify proxyPort=

        proxyHost=

        useProxy=

The proxyRealm, proxyPassword, and proxyUserName are not always required. Ask your Network
Administrator which properties are needed and what the values should be.
