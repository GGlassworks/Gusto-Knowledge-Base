   Each payment on an installment sale usually consists
of the following three parts.
 • Interest income.
 • Return of your adjusted basis in the property.

Step 2: Compute the Applicable Percentage
The applicable percentage is computed in the year of sale and is used for all subsequent years.

                              Aggregate face amount of obligations arising in a tax year and outstanding as of the close of such tax year from
                              dispositions with sales price > $150,000

                              (14,000,000 – 5,000,000)                                                        = 64.2857%
                                   14,000,000

Step 3: Determine the Underpayment Rate
The underpayment rate as of December 31, 2021, was 3%. The underpayment rate under section 453A(c)(2)(B) is the underpayment rate
determined under section 6621(a)(2).

Step 4: Compute the Interest Due (Additional Tax) on the Deferred Tax Liability


                               =         Deferred Tax Liability        x       Applicable Percentage          x            Underpayment Rate

 Step 2: Compute the Applicable Percentage

                                     Aggregate face amount of obligations arising in a tax year and
                                     outstanding as of the close of such tax year from dispositions with               –                 5,000,000

 Note. The Applicable Percentage is computed in the initial year the installment sale arises. It does not change as payments are made in subsequent years.

 Step 3: Determine the Underpayment Rate

 Step 4: Compute the Interest Due (Additional Tax) on the Deferred Tax Liability
                             =       Deferred Tax Liability     x      Applicable Percentage                           x            Underpayment Rate
