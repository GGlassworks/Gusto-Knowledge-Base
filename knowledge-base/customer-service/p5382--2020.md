                                   We will empower taxpayers by making it easier for them to understand and meet their
                                   filing, reporting and payment obligations. We continue to add and enhance tools and

                                   Partnerships with IRS stakeholders enrich service to taxpayers. Collaboration will yield

                                   IRS employees are committed to serving the American taxpayer. We strive for a culture

     the six in-person Nationwide Tax Forums

     put attendance in line with previous
