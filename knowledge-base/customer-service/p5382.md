Office, established last year, has been
setting the strategic direction for
improving the taxpayer experience and
identifying opportunities to make
continuous improvements in real time for
taxpayers and tax professionals. These
efforts are being combined into work
underway now to plan the future of the
agency made possible by the historic
funding provided by the Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022.

The funding provided under the Inflation
Reduction Act is a momentous
development for the IRS, and a once-in-
a-generation opportunity for the IRS to
transform itself. These improvements are
critical to the future of our agency and
our nation, and the benefits will be
important for IRS employees, individual
taxpayers, businesses, exempt
organizations, the tax community and
many others. This is an opportunity to
reshape the IRS and turn it into the
organization that taxpayers deserve and
expect.

We believe the improvements we have
already made and more on the horizon
– both in 2023 and in the years beyond
with the Inflation Reduction Act – will
make a difference for the agency. These
efforts will produce abundant benefits
for taxpayers, the tax system and our
nation well into the future. As you will
see in these pages, IRS employees are
eager to help taxpayers and our great
nation – now and in the future.

The IRS unveiled a new strategic plan during 2022. The IRS FY
2022-2026 Strategic Plan builds on progress made and outcomes
achieved over many years, while weaving together the IRS mission,
values and priorities. After performing a comprehensive current-
state assessment of the Service, we designed a plan to enable
employees and stakeholders to see how their contributions support
our mission of delivering high quality taxpayer service and fair
enforcement of the tax law.
The Strategic Goals for FY 2022–2026 reflect a long-standing
principle of putting the interests of our taxpayers first in everything
we do. It is what drives us in our mission to provide high-quality
services and fairly and impartially enforce the law. Our employees
continually strive to understand and meet the needs of taxpayers
and protect their rights. These goals are driven by a “One IRS”
mindset that is crucial to delivering our mission for all taxpayers.
Additionally, our goals and objectives support Treasury’s Strategic
Plan and governmentwide priorities.
This five-year plan provides a blueprint for our continued
organizational success. A tireless dedication to providing a high-
quality taxpayer experience, a determined approach to
enforcement, a commitment to our people in fostering an inclusive
workplace and an organizational transformation to meet critical and
future needs will enable the IRS to continue to play our vital role in    Stakeholder Partnerships, Education

     and working to find innovative ways to
     help taxpayers. For example, to provide
     small business owners with helpful tax
     information, we have reached out to
     organizations representing all types of
     industries. Another great example of this
     innovation involves our ongoing
     partnerships with billboard companies.
     In FY 2022 alone, more than four dozen
     of these companies around the country
     displayed tax season messages on their
     billboards, to help taxpayers claim
     important tax credits as well as file their
     returns accurately and on time.

     In another effort taking us beyond the
     tax community, in FY 2022 we continued
     working with more than 13,000 public
     school districts. This C&L effort began
     with outreach and education on
     Economic Impact Payments, and
     continued with the advance CTC,
     resulting in 58 events. We will build on
     these successes during the upcoming
     tax filing season.
