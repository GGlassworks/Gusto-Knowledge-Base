Introduction
        Federally recognized Indian tribal governments aren’t subject to federal income tax but they
        must pay employment tax on wages paid to employees. Members of a federally recognized
        Indian tribe are subject to federal income and employment tax and the provisions of the Internal
        Revenue Code (IRC), like other United States citizens.
        Determinations on taxability must be based on a review of the IRC, treaties and case law. Rev.
        Rul. 67-284, 1967-2 C.B. 55 states there is no provision in the IRC exempting amounts received by
        an ”individual” from federal income tax solely on the grounds that the individual is a member of
        a federally recognized Indian tribe. In addition to the exemptions enjoyed by other U.S. Citizens,
        individual Indians may enjoy exemptions that derive plainly from treaties or agreements with the
        Indian tribes concerned, or some act of Congress dealing with their affairs.
        This publication:
           Discusses the taxability of common income types,
           Provides resources for more information, and
           Provides guidance on reporting income on the individual’s federal income tax return and the
            correct terminology to use to identify the income source on the return. These identifiers help
            ensure that income is correctly interpreted during the return processing.


Earned Income and Investment Income

        Wages/Self-Employment Income
        In most situations, members of federally recognized tribes who work for an employer or who
        are self-employed are subject to federal income taxes on wages and self-employment income
        earned. The amount received from an employer (Form W-2 wages) is reported on the “wages”
        line of the individual’s tax return, while self-employment income is reported on Schedule C,
        Profit or Loss From Business. They are subject to both income and FICA tax (including self-
        employment tax). Generally, your employer must:
           Withhold the employee’s share of taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA),
           Withhold federal income tax from employees’ wages, and
           Pay federal employment taxes on wages paid to employees.
        Note: IRC Section 7873 provides an exemption for income earned from the exercise of treaty-
        based fishing rights.

        Tip Income
        Tip income is fully taxable, regardless of the source, and tips reported to the employer must be
        included on the employee’s Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement. If an employee receives $20
        or more a month in cash tips, they must report 100% of those tips to the employer through a
        written report. Cash tips include tips paid by cash, check, debit card and credit card. The written
        report should include tips paid to the employee for charge customers, tips received directly from
        customers and tips received from other employees under any tip sharing arrangement. Tips not
        reported to the employer must be shown separately on the employee’s Form 1040, U.S. Individual
        Income Tax Return, and Form 4137, Social Security and Medicare Tax on Unreported Tip Income,
        must be attached.
For more information read Publication 531, Reporting Tip Income, Publication 3148, Tips
on Tips - A Guide to Tip Income Reporting for Employees Who Receive Tip Income, and
Publication 1244, Employee’s Daily Record of Tips and Report of Tips to Employer.

Passive Income
All forms of passive income are taxable unless excludable by law. There are two kinds of passive
activities:
1. Trade or business activities in which you do not materially participate during the year, and
2. Rental activities.
See Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules, for more information.

Investment Income
Income earned from investments, including interest, dividends, royalties, annuities and capital
gains, is generally includible in gross income and is taxable.
Almost everything you own and use for personal or investment purposes is a capital asset.
Examples are your home, household furnishings and stocks or bonds. When you sell a capital
asset, the difference between the amounts you sell it for and your basis, which is usually what
you paid for it, is a capital gain or a capital loss.
This must be distinguished from income earned from the use of restricted individual allotments
that are held in trust by the U.S. government. There is a limited exception from tax for income
directly derived from alloted land held in trust. See “Income Exempt from Federal Taxes” for
additional information.
All income earned from reinvestments (regardless of whether the reinvested money was taxable
or nontaxable) is generally includible in gross income subject to federal income tax.
The following table provides information on the most common types of earned and investment
income.

Distributions

        Per Capita Distributions
        The distribution of money or other things of value to all members of the tribe that are paid
        directly from the net revenues of any tribal gaming activity or other sources of income, such as
        income derived from unallotted common tribal lands is generally taxable and is usually reported
        by the tribe on Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income.
        However, per capita distributions made from funds the Secretary of the Interior holds in a
        tribal trust account are generally excluded from the gross income of the members of the tribe
        receiving the per capita distributions. See Notice 2015-67.
        Tribal members report taxable per capita distributions on Form 1040, Schedule 1, Additional
        Income and Adjustments to Income, on the line item “other income.” We suggest you describe
        the type of income on the blank space on the “other income line” for example, “Indian gaming
        proceeds,” “Indian gaming per capita distribution” or “non-gaming business proceeds.” Report
        any applicable withholding shown on Form 1099-MISC as “federal income tax withheld” on Form
        1040.

        General Welfare Distributions
        General welfare distributions are payments the tribe has set aside for special purposes or
        programs, such as payments made for social welfare, medical assistance, education, housing or
        other similar specifically identified needs. Under the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of
        2014, IRC Sections 139D and 139E, Rev. Proc. 2014-35 and Notice 2015-34 such payments
        are excludable from gross income if certain criteria are met. Generally, the tribe will not
        have to issue a Form 1099 for a general welfare payment to individual Indians.


Income Exempt from Federal Taxes
        The exclusion of an amount from gross income for federal income and employment tax purposes
        must derive plainly from treaties or agreements with the Indian tribes concerned, or some act
        of Congress dealing with their affairs. The following table summarizes the treatment of the most
        common types of exempt income.
