see Pub. 501.


Social Security Number (SSN)
If you choose to treat your nonresident alien spouse as a
U.S. resident, your spouse must have either an SSN or an
individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN).
   To get an SSN for a nonresident alien spouse, apply at
an office of the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA)
or U.S. consulate. For more information, go to SSA.gov or
call 800-772-1213.
   If the nonresident alien spouse is not eligible to get an
SSN, the spouse can file Form W-7, Application for IRS
Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, with the IRS to
apply for an ITIN when you timely file the joint return on
which you choose to treat your nonresident alien spouse
as a U.S. resident. Follow the Instructions for Form W-7 to
submit your Form W-7 and file your return.

Table 1-1. Options for Ending the Choice To Treat Nonresident Alien Spouse as a Resident
 Revocation           Either spouse can revoke the choice for any tax year.
                      The revocation must be made by the due date for filing the tax return for that tax year.
                      The spouse who revokes the choice must attach a signed statement declaring that the choice is being revoked. The statement
                      revoking the choice must include the following.
                        • The name, address, and SSN (or TIN) of each spouse.
                        • The name and address of any person who is revoking the choice for a deceased spouse.
                        • A list of any states, foreign countries, and U.S. territories that have community property laws in which either spouse is
                           domiciled or where real property is located from which either spouse receives income.
                      If the spouse revoking the choice does not have to file a return and does not file a claim for refund, send the statement to the Internal
                      Revenue Service Center where the last joint return was filed.

 Death                The death of either spouse ends the choice, beginning with the first tax year following the year in which the spouse died.
                      If the qualifying surviving spouse is a U.S. citizen or resident alien and is entitled to the joint tax rates as a qualifying surviving
                      spouse, the choice will not end until the close of the last year for which these joint rates may be used.
                      If both spouses die in the same tax year, the choice ends on the first day after the close of the tax year in which the spouses died.

 Divorce or legal     A divorce or legal separation ends the choice as of the beginning of the tax year in which the legal separation occurs.
 separation

 Inadequate records   The IRS can end the choice for any tax year that either spouse has failed to keep adequate books, records, and other
                      information necessary to determine the correct income tax liability, or to provide adequate access to those records.
