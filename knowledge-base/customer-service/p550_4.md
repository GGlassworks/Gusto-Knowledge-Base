 1. Your allowable capital loss deduction for the year, or      rate does not apply.
 2. Your taxable income increased by your allowable cap-
    ital loss deduction for the year.
   If your deductions are more than your gross income for
the tax year, use your negative taxable income in figuring
the amount in (2) above.
   Complete Worksheet 4-1 to determine the part of your
capital loss that you can carry over.

   Example. Bob and Shelly sold securities in 2024. The
sales resulted in a capital loss of $7,000. They had no
other capital transactions. Their taxable income was
$26,000. On their joint 2024 return, they can deduct
$3,000. The unused part of the loss, $4,000 ($7,000 −
$3,000), can be carried over to 2025.
   If their capital loss had been $2,000, their capital loss
deduction would have been $2,000. They would have no
carryover.
    Use short-term losses first. When you figure your
capital loss carryover, use your short-term capital losses
first, even if you incurred them after a long-term capital
loss. If you have not reached the limit on the capital loss
deduction after using the short-term capital losses, use
the long-term capital losses until you reach the limit.
   Decedent's capital loss. A capital loss sustained by a
decedent during the decedent’s last tax year (or carried
over to that year from an earlier year) can be deducted
only on the final income tax return filed for the decedent.
The capital loss limits discussed earlier still apply in this
situation. The decedent's estate cannot deduct any of the
loss or carry it over to following years.
   Joint and separate returns. If you and your spouse
once filed separate returns and are now filing a joint re-
turn, combine your separate capital loss carryovers. How-
ever, if you and your spouse once filed a joint return and
are now filing separate returns, any capital loss carryover
from the joint return can be deducted only on the return of
the spouse who actually had the loss.

Capital Gain Tax Rates
The tax rates that apply to a net capital gain are generally
lower than the tax rates that apply to other income. These
lower rates are called the maximum capital gain rates.
