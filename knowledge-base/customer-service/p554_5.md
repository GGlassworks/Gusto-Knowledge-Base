      If you were born before January 2, 1960, you are considered to be age 65 or older at the end of 2024. (If your spouse died

      Gross income means all income you receive in the form of money, goods, property, and services that isn't exempt from
      tax, including any income from sources outside the United States or from the sale of your main home (even if you can
      exclude part or all of it). It also includes gains, but not losses, reported on Form 8949 or Schedule D. Gross income from a
      business means, for example, the amount on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9. But, in figuring gross income, don't
      reduce your income by any losses, including any loss on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9. Don't include any
      social security benefits unless (a) you are married filing separately and you lived with your spouse at any time in 2024, or
      (b) one-half of your social security benefits plus your other gross income and any tax-exempt interest is more than
      $25,000 ($32,000* if married filing jointly). If (a) or (b) applies, see the Instructions for Form 1040 or Pub. 915 to figure the
      taxable part of social security benefits you must include in gross income.
  ***
      If you didn't live with your spouse at the end of 2024 (or on the date your spouse died) and your gross income was at least
      $5, you must file a return regardless of your age.

* Earned income includes wages, salaries, tips, professional fees, and other compensation received for personal services you performed. It also
includes any taxable scholarship or fellowship grant. Generally, your earned income is the total of the amount(s) you reported on Form 1040 or
1040-SR, line 1z, and Schedule 1 (Form 1040), lines 3, 6, 8r, 8t, and 8u minus the amount, if any, on Schedule 1 (Form 1040), line 15.

** You may be able to increase the amount of your standard deduction on line 6 by a loss you suffered related to property in one of
the Presidentially declared disaster areas eligible for that relief. See Pub. 976 for more information.

Medical and Dental Expenses
You can deduct certain medical and dental expenses you
paid for yourself, your spouse, and your dependent(s) if
you itemize your deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040).
   Table 4-1 shows some common items that you can or
can't include in figuring your medical expense deduction.
