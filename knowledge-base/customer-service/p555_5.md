  In Idaho, Louisiana, Texas, and Wisconsin, income from most separate property is community income.

  Check your state law if you are separated but don't meet the conditions discussed under Spouses living apart all year, later. In some
   states, the income you earn after you are separated and before a divorce decree is issued continues to be community income. In other
   states, it is separate income.

  Under special rules, income that can otherwise be characterized as community income may not be treated as community income for
   federal income tax purposes in certain situations. See Community Property Laws Disregarded, later.
