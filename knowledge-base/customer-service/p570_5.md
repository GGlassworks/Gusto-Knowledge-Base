* If you were born on January 1, 1960, you are considered to be age 65 at the end of 2024. (If your spouse died in 2024 or if you are preparing a return for
   someone who died in 2024, see Pub. 501.)
** Gross income means all income you received in the form of money, goods, property, and services that is not exempt from tax, including any income from
   sources outside the United States or from the sale of your main home (even if you can exclude part or all of it). Do not include any social security benefits
   unless (a) you are married filing a separate return and you lived with your spouse at any time during 2024, or (b) one-half of your social security benefits plus
   your other gross income and any tax-exempt interest is more than $25,000 ($32,000 if married filing jointly). If (a) or (b) applies, see the Instructions for Form
   1040 or Pub. 915 to figure the taxable part of social security benefits you must include in gross income. Gross income includes gains, but not losses,
   reported on Form 8949 or Schedule D. Gross income from a business means, for example, the amount on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9. But, in
   figuring gross income, do not reduce your income by any losses, including any loss on Schedule C, line 7, or Schedule F, line 9.
*** If you did not live with your spouse at the end of 2024 (or on the date your spouse died) and your gross income was at least $5, you must file a return
   regardless of your age.
