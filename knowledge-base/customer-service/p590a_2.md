           Is the amount on line 10 more than the amount on line 11?
           If “Yes,” see the Note below.
           If “No,” the amount on line 10 is your modified adjusted gross income
           for Roth IRA purposes.
           Note. If the amount on line 10 is more than the amount on line 11 and you have other income
           or loss items, such as social security income or passive activity losses, that are subject to
           AGI-based phaseouts, you can refigure your AGI solely for the purpose of figuring your
           modified AGI for Roth IRA purposes. (If you receive social security benefits, use Worksheet 1
           in Appendix B to refigure your AGI.) Then, go to line 3 above in this Worksheet 2-1 to refigure
           your modified AGI. If you don’t have other income or loss items subject to AGI-based
           phaseouts, your modified adjusted gross income for Roth IRA purposes is the amount on
           line 10 above.

Comprehensive Example
Determining Your Traditional IRA Deduction and
the Taxable Portion of Your Social Security Benefits
   You are married and file a joint return. You are 65 years old and had 2024 wages of $115,000. Your spouse didn’t work in
2024. You received social security benefits of $12,000 and made a $8,000 contribution to your traditional IRA for the year.
You had no foreign income, no tax-exempt interest, and no adjustments to income on lines 11 through 26 on your Schedule 1
(Form 1040). You participated in a section 401(k) retirement plan at work.
  You complete Worksheets 1 and 2. Worksheet 2 shows that your 2024 IRA deduction is $7,200. You must either withdraw
the contributions that are more than the deduction amount (the $880 shown on line 8 of Worksheet 2) or treat the excess
amounts as nondeductible contributions (in which case you must complete Form 8606 and attach it to your Form 1040-SR).
  The completed worksheets that follow show how you figured your modified AGI to determine the IRA deduction and the
taxable social security benefits to report on your Form 1040-SR.
