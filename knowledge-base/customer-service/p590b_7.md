Worksheet 1-1. Figuring the Taxable Part of Your IRA Distribution
Use only if you made contributions to a traditional IRA for 2024 that may not be fully deductible and have to figure the
taxable part of your 2024 distributions to determine your modified AGI. See Limit if Covered by Employer Plan in
chapter 1 of Pub. 590-A.
Form 8606 and the related instructions will be needed when using this worksheet.
Note. When used in this worksheet, the term “outstanding rollover” refers to an amount distributed from a traditional
IRA as part of a rollover that, as of December 31, 2024, hadn't yet been reinvested in another traditional IRA, but was still
eligible to be rolled over tax free.

     contributions made during 2025 that were for 2024, whether or not deductible. Don't

     and a one-time distribution to fund a health savings account (HSA). (Don’t include

 Note. If the amount on line 5 of this worksheet includes an amount converted to a Roth IRA by December 31, 2024, you must
 determine the percentage of the distribution allocable to the conversion. To figure the percentage, divide the amount converted
 (from line 16 of Form 8606) by the total distributions shown on line 5. To figure the amounts to include on line 10 of this worksheet
 and on line 18 of Form 8606, multiply line 9 of the worksheet by the percentage you figured.

Worksheet 1-1. Figuring the Taxable Part of Your IRA Distribution—Illustrated

taxable part of your 2024 distributions to determine your modified AGI. See Limit if Covered by Employer Plan in
chapter 1 of Pub. 590-A.
Form 8606 and the related instructions will be needed when using this worksheet.
Note. When used in this worksheet, the term “outstanding rollover” refers to an amount distributed from a traditional
IRA as part of a rollover that, as of December 31, 2024 hadn't yet been reinvested in another traditional IRA, but was still
eligible to be rolled over tax free.

 Note. If the amount on line 5 of this worksheet includes an amount converted to a Roth IRA by December 31, 2024, you must
 determine the percentage of the distribution allocable to the conversion. To figure the percentage, divide the amount converted
 (from line 16 of Form 8606) by the total distributions shown on line 5. To figure the amounts to include on line 10 of this worksheet
 and on line 18 of Form 8606, multiply line 9 of the worksheet by the percentage you figured.
