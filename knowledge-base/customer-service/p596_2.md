earned wages of $15,000 and Jordan had wages of
$18,030. The Greys received $525 in interest on their sav-
ings account. They had no other income in 2024.
   Cameron and Jordan have the 2024 Form 1040 and in-
structions. They want to see if they qualify for the EIC, so
they follow the steps for Line 27 in the Instructions for
Form 1040.

Step 1. The amount Cameron and Jordan entered on
Form 1040, line 11, was $33,555. They both have valid
SSNs, which they have had for many years. They are mar-
ried and will file a joint return. Neither Cameron nor Jordan
is a nonresident alien. Therefore, the answers they give to
the questions in Step 1 allow them to proceed to Step 2.

Step 2. The only investment income the Greys have is
their $525 interest income. That amount isn't more than
$11,600, so they answer “No” to the second question in
Step 2 and go to Step 3.

Step 3. Their children meet the relationship, age, resi-
dency, and joint return tests to be Cameron and Jordan's
qualifying children, so Cameron and Jordan answer “Yes”
to the first question in Step 3. Their children aren't qualify-
ing children of anyone else. Both children have valid
SSNs, which they received soon after birth. Cameron and
Jordan are filing a joint return, so they answer “Yes” to the
second question in Step 3. This means they can skip
questions 3 though 6 and Step 4 and go to Step 5.

Step 5. Cameron and Jordan figure their earned income
to be $33,030, the amount of their combined wages. This
is less than $62,688, so they go to Step 6 to figure their
credit.

Step 6. Cameron and Jordan want to figure their EIC
themselves, so they complete the EIC Worksheet in the
Form 1040 instructions.

Completing the EIC Worksheet. Cameron and Jordan
complete their worksheet as follows.
 1. Cameron and Jordan enter their total earned income
    ($33,030) on line 1.
 2. To find their credit, they go to the EIC Table. They find
    their earned income of $33,030 in the range of
    $33,000 to $33,050. Because both of their children
    have valid SSNs, they follow this line across to the
    column for 2 children under Married filing jointly and
    find $6,247. They enter $6,247 on line 2.
 3. They enter on line 3 their AGI ($33,555) and see that
    it is different from the amount on line 1.
 4. They look up $33,555 in the EIC Table and enter the
    amount of $6,131 on line 5.
