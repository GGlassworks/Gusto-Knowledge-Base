later, under How To Report Your Benefits.




Example. You are over age 65 and are filing a single return for 2024 and you received social security benefits during
the year. In January 2025, you received a Form SSA-1099 showing net benefits of $1,500 in box 5. You also received a
taxable pension of $16,000 and interest income of $700. You didn’t have any tax-exempt interest income. Your benefits
aren’t taxable for 2024 because your income, as figured on Worksheet A, isn’t more than your base amount ($25,000)
for single.
    Even though none of your benefits are taxable, you must file a return for 2024 because your taxable gross income
($17,450) exceeds the minimum filing requirement amount for your filing status.

taxable pension of $15,500. Casey also received social security benefits, and Casey’s Form SSA-1099 for 2024 shows
net benefits of $5,600 in box 5. Pat worked during the year and had wages of $14,000. Pat made a deductible payment
to Pat’s IRA account of $1,000 and isn’t covered by a retirement plan at work. Casey and Pat have two savings
accounts with a total of $250 in taxable interest income. They complete Worksheet 1, shown below, entering $29,750
($15,500 + $14,000 + $250) on line 3. They find none of Casey's social security benefits are taxable. On Form 1040,
they enter $5,600 on line 6a and -0- on line 6b.

Example 3. Jamie and Jessie Johnson file a joint return on Form 1040 for 2024. Jamie is a retired railroad worker and in 2024
received the SSEB portion of tier 1 railroad retirement benefits. Jamie’s Form RRB-1099 shows $10,000 in box 5. Jessie is a retired
government worker and received a fully taxable pension of $38,000. They had $2,300 in taxable interest income plus interest of
$200 on a qualified U.S. savings bond. The savings bond interest qualified for the exclusion. They figure their taxable benefits by
completing Worksheet 1, shown below. Because they have qualified U.S. savings bond interest, they follow the note at the
beginning of the worksheet and use the amount from line 2 of their Schedule B (Form 1040) on line 3 of the worksheet instead of the
amount from line 2b of their Form 1040. On line 3 of the worksheet, they enter $40,500 ($38,000 + $2,500). More than 50% of
Jamie's net benefits are taxable because the income on line 8 of the worksheet ($45,500) is more than $44,000. (See Maximum
taxable part under How Much Is Taxable, earlier.) Jamie and Jessie enter $10,000 on Form 1040, line 6a; and $6,275 on Form
1040, line 6b.

Kris and Taylor Jones are married and live together, but file separate Form 1040 returns for 2024. Taylor did not have
any earned income for 2024. Kris earned $8,000 during 2024. The only other income Kris had for the year was $4,000
net social security benefits (box 5 of Kris’s Form SSA-1099). Kris figures Kris’s taxable benefits by completing
Worksheet 1, shown below. Kris must include 85% of Kris’s social security benefits in Kris’s taxable income because
Kris is married filing separately and lived with Taylor during 2024. See How Much Is Taxable, earlier. Kris enters $4,000
on Kris’s Form 1040, line 6a; and $3,400 on Form 1040, line 6b.
