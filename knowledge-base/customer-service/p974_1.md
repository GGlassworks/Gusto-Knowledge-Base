Before you begin:
  • See Worksheet N to determine whether the QSEHRA is considered affordable coverage for any month. If the QSEHRA is considered affordable
    coverage for some months but not others, see the instructions for column B below for the amount you enter in column B for the affordable
    months.
  • If the monthly permitted benefit was the same for each month you were provided the QSEHRA and the QSEHRA was not considered affordable
    for all of those months, go to Part I. If the monthly permitted benefit was not the same for each month you were provided the QSEHRA or the
    QSEHRA was considered affordable for some but not all the months it was provided, go to Part III. Skip Parts I and II.
Caution. If you received a self-only permitted benefit for part of the year and a family permitted benefit for another part of the year, you must
complete Part III even though the amount reported on your Form W-2 reflects this change.

Before you begin:                 Read Exceptions, later, to see if you can use this worksheet instead of Form 7206 to figure your deduction
                              for nonspecified premiums. Also read the definitions of specified premiums and nonspecified premiums.
1.     Enter the total amount of nonspecified premiums paid in 2024 for health insurance coverage
       established under your business (or the S corporation in which you were a more-than-2%
       shareholder) for 2024 for you, your spouse, and your dependents. Your insurance can also

            figure the PTC for specified premiums.
         • If line 2 is more than line 1, complete Worksheet W. Also complete Worksheet X if APTC
            was paid to your insurer on your behalf for the months you were self-employed. If APTC
            was not paid to your insurer on your behalf for the months you were self-employed, skip
            Worksheet X.


* If you used either optional method to figure your net earnings from self-employment, do not enter your net profit. Instead, enter the
amount from Schedule SE, line 4b.

** Earned income includes net earnings and gains from the sale, transfer, or licensing of property you created. However, it does not
include capital gain income. If you were a more-than-2% shareholder in the S corporation under which the insurance plan is
established, earned income is your Medicare wages (box 5 of Form W-2) from that corporation.

   Example. You were enrolled in a qualified health plan
through the Marketplace for all of 2024 and you were
self-employed from September 15 through December 31.
Only the premiums for the last 4 months are specified pre-
miums and only those premiums are entered on Work-
sheet W, line 1, and Worksheet X, line 27, if you are re-
quired to complete those worksheets. You are not allowed
a self-employed health insurance deduction for the Janu-
ary through August premiums because you were not
self-employed during those months. Those premiums are
neither specified premiums nor nonspecified premiums.
However, you may be allowed a PTC for your coverage for
January through August.

Plan covering individuals in another tax family. If the
plan covers at least one individual in your tax family and
one individual in another tax family, you may have to allo-
cate policy amounts between your tax family and the other
tax family. See Line 9 in the Form 8962 instructions for in-
structions on how to allocate policy amounts. Do this allo-
cation before you determine the portion of the specified
premiums allocable to your coverage family discussed

the amount on line 22 above as your self-employed health insurance deduction. Also, use the amount on line 2 above in any step
that requires you to figure AGI, modified AGI, and household income. If the amount on line 2 above is the only deduction/exclusion
on the list that you are claiming, complete either method through the last step. If you are claiming another deduction/exclusion on
the list, do the following.
  • When you repeat either method as explained above, complete the Iterative Calculation Method through Step 6 or complete the
     Simplified Calculation Method through Step 3. Enter “400” on the interim Form 8962, line 5, if you answer “Yes” on Worksheet 2,
     line 3, in the Form 8962 instructions.
  • Figure the other deduction/exclusion using the appropriate form or the worksheet provided in your tax return instructions. Use
     the self-employed health insurance deduction you figured in either Step 6 of the Iterative Calculation Method or Step 3 of the
     Simplified Calculation Method to figure modified AGI for the other deduction/exclusion.
  • Then, complete Worksheet Z for the other deduction/exclusion.
