FOREWORD :

                      I am pleased to provide the fiscal year 2020 update to the         information that is shared with our customers.
                      Arizona Department of Revenue 2018-2022 Strategic Plan.
                                                                                         This update maintains ADOR’s steadfast commitment to results-driven management
                      As the cover for this fiscal year’s update showcases, the          through the Arizona Management System to deliver better, faster and more cost-
                      Department of Revenue’s focus is to fund the many programs         effective service for Arizonans. It also maintains a focus on customer service that
                      and services that Arizonans enjoy and rely on every day.           was built into our five-year strategic plan.

                      Based on the agency’s mission of Serving Taxpayers!, the           Carlton Woodruff
                      department’s approach to this fiscal year continues to be          Interim Director
 guided by the five-year blueprint’s four priorities of optimizing taxpayer services,
 accelerating processing, maximizing taxpayer education and compliance, and
 supporting and championing the agency’s mission.

 For fiscal year 2020, the agency is implementing remote seller legislation, which
 requires out-of-state sellers and marketplace facilitators to begin filing and paying
 TPT in Arizona as of October 1, 2019.

 The updated plan has corporate taxpayers filing their income tax electronically in
 2020, an important advancement in this department’s commitment to e-filing and
 supports another objective to continue to increase electronic filing and paying.

 This fiscal year’s update also includes conforming to the Internal Revenue Code,
 which encompasses key modifications to state tax forms and systems, as well as
 reducing the number of tax brackets from five to four for individual income taxes.

 Additionally, the Strategic Plan Update for fiscal year 2020 has the department
 enhancing our agency’s administration and execution of the transaction privilege
 tax system, which is part of ADOR’s ongoing collaboration with municipalities and
 counties. And the plan outlines a commitment to further developing taxpayer
 communication plan that will result in compiling and evaluating all existing
 communications to taxpayers to determine what is needed to further develop all
OUR ORGANIZATION :
                                                                                                                                                      Carlton Woodruff
                                                                                                                                                        INTERIM DIRECTOR
 Our strategy begins with a comprehensive look at ADOR’s ecosystem as an organization — an ecosystem
 that includes a variety of perspectives and demands that influence our vital mission. We then make an honest
 assessment of our recent past and current reality, including a brutally honest evaluation of our performance. We
 refer to this as the “current state”. The Governor’s vision for the state and the agency’s vision together define           Carlton Woodruff                                 Grant Nülle

 our desired “future state”. It is by analyzing the gap between our current state and future state that we develop
 our plan. ADOR has adopted strategic goals to close the gap between the reality of our current challenges and
 future state vision.

 In addition to the goals, ADOR has identified strategic initiatives to help overcome challenges that could keep
 us from closing the gap. The strategies are to be developed as specific projects to resolve the challenges. The         Tom Johnson                      Derek Beck               Kelly Peloquin
 outcomes associated with our goals, as supported by our strategies, and as executed through our projects, will      EDUCATION & COMPLIANCE                PROCESSING             TAXPAYER SERVICES
 be measured rigorously by our performance measures.

 The performance measures ADOR has adopted track success through two primary lenses: the return on
 investment that taxpayers demand as an outcome of fulfilling our mission — i.e., delivering the revenue that
 finances Arizona’s future, and customer value in the form of quality service.

                                                                                                                                                          SUPPORT
