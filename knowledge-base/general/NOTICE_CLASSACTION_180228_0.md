NOTICE FROM THE ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE

                             PINAL COUNTY PROPOSITION 417

In 2017, voters in Pinal County, Arizona approved Proposition 417, which purports to enact a
transportation excise (sales) tax for twenty years to provide funding for the transportation
elements contained in a Pinal Regional Transportation Plan. Several plaintiffs filed an action in
the Arizona Tax Court to challenge the purported tax. See Harold Vangilder v. Ariz. Dep’t of
Revenue, TX2017-000663. Relevant pleadings from the case can be found on the Department’s
website. Docket and other information about the case may be found on the Maricopa County
Superior Court’s website.

Unless the Tax Court instructs otherwise, the Department of Revenue will begin collecting the
Pinal County tax beginning with the reporting period starting April 1, 2018.
