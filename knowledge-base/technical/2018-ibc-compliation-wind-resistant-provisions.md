Building Code. [partial shown]

User Note: The chapters shown below are those that are highlighted in this document and provide wind resistant
provisions.

Chapter 1 Scope and Administration. Chapter 1 establishes the limits of applicability of the code and describes
how the code is to be applied and enforced. [partial shown]

Chapter 2 Definitions. An alphabetical listing of all defined terms is located in Chapter 2. Defined terms that are
pertinent to a specific chapter or section are also found in that chapter or section with a reference back to Chapter

Chapter 4 Special Detailed Requirements Based On Use and Occupancy. Chapter 4 contains the requirements
for protecting special uses and occupancies, which are supplemental to the remainder of the code. [partial shown]

The chapter includes requirements for buildings and conditions that apply to one or more groups, such as high-rise
buildings, underground buildings or atriums. Special uses may also imply specific occupancies and operations,
such as for Group H, hazardous materials, application of flammable finishes, drying rooms, organic coatings and
combustible storage or hydrogen fuel gas rooms, all of which are coordinated with the IFC. Unique consideration
is taken for special use areas, such as covered mall buildings, motor-vehicle-related occupancies, special
amusement buildings and aircraft-related occupancies. Special facilities within other occupancies are considered,
such as stages and platforms, motion picture projection rooms, children’s play structures and storm shelters.
[partial shown]
Chapter 14 Exterior Walls. [partial shown] This chapter addresses requirements for exterior walls of buildings.
Minimum standards for wall covering materials, installation of wall coverings and the ability of the wall to
provide weather protection are provided. The installation of each type of wall covering, be it wood, masonry,
vinyl, metal composite material, or an exterior insulation and finish system, is critical to its long-term performance
in protecting the interior of the building from the elements and the spread of fire.
Chapter 15 Roof Assemblies and Rooftop Structures. Chapter 15 provides standards for both roof assemblies
as well as structures that sit on top of the roof of buildings. The criteria address roof construction and covering,
including the weather-protective barrier at the roof and, in most circumstances, a fire-resistant barrier. The chapter
is prescriptive in nature and is based on decades of experience with various traditional materials, but it also
addresses newer products such as photovoltaic shingles. These prescriptive rules are very important for satisfying
performance of one type of roof covering or another. Section 1510 addresses rooftop structures, including
penthouses, tanks, towers and spires. Rooftop penthouses larger than prescribed in this chapter must be treated as
a story under Chapter 5.
Chapter 16 Structural Design. Chapter 16 prescribes minimum structural loading requirements for use in the
design and construction of buildings and structural components. It includes minimum design loads, assignment of
risk categories and permitted design methodologies. Standards are provided for minimum design loads (live, dead,
snow, wind, rain, flood, ice, and earthquake as well as the required load combinations). The application of these
loads and adherence to the serviceability criteria will enhance the protection of life and property. The chapter
references and relies on many nationally recognized design standards. A key standard is the American Society of
Civil Engineer’s Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures (ASCE 7). Structural design must
address the conditions of the site and location. Therefore, maps are provided of rainfall, seismic, snow and wind
criteria in different regions.
Chapter 17 Special Inspections and Tests. Chapter 17 provides a variety of procedures and criteria for testing
materials and assemblies, labeling materials and assemblies and special inspection of structural assemblies. This
chapter expands on the inspections of Chapter 1 by requiring special inspection where indicated and, in some
cases, structural observation. It also spells out additional responsibilities for the owner, contractor, design
professionals and special inspectors. Proper assembly of structural components, proper quality of materials used
and proper application of materials are essential to ensuring that a building, once constructed, complies with the
structural and fire-resistance minimums of the code and the approved design. To determine this compliance often
requires continuous or frequent inspection and testing. Chapter 17 establishes standards for special inspection,
testing and reporting of the work to the building official.
Chapter 18 Soils and Foundations. Chapter 18 provides criteria for geotechnical and structural considerations in
the selection, design and installation of foundation systems to support the loads from the structure above. The
“FEMA’s mission is to help people before, during, and after disasters.”                                     Page 3 of 43
 Federal Emergency Management Agency
 Wind Resistant Provisions of the 2018 International Building Code®


chapter includes requirements for soils investigation and site preparation for receiving a foundation, including the
allowed load-bearing values for soils and for protecting the foundation from water intrusion. Section 1808
addresses the basic requirements for all foundation types. Later sections address foundation requirements that are
specific to shallow foundations and deep foundations. Due care must be exercised in the planning and design of
foundation systems based on obtaining sufficient soils information, the use of accepted engineering procedures,
experience and good technical judgment.
Chapter 21 Masonry. This chapter provides comprehensive and practical requirements for masonry construction.
The provisions of Chapter 21 require minimum accepted practices and the use of standards for the design and
construction of masonry structures. The provisions address: material specifications and test methods; types of wall
construction; criteria for engineered and empirical designs; and required details of construction, including the
execution of construction. Masonry design methodologies including allowable stress design, strength design and
empirical design are covered by provisions of the chapter. Also addressed are masonry fireplaces and chimneys,
masonry heaters and glass unit masonry. Fire-resistant construction using masonry is also required to comply with
Chapter 7. Masonry foundations are also subject to the requirements of Chapter 18.

Chapter 22 Steel. Chapter 22 provides the requirements necessary for the design and construction of structural
steel (including composite construction), cold-formed steel, steel joists, steel cable structures and steel storage
racks. This chapter specifies appropriate design and construction standards for these types of structures. It also
provides a road map of the applicable technical requirements for steel structures. Because steel is a
noncombustible building material, it is commonly associated with Types I and II construction; however, it is
permitted to be used in all types of construction. Chapter 22 requires that the design and use of steel materials be
in accordance with the specifications and standards of the American Institute of Steel Construction, the American
Iron and Steel Institute, the Steel Joist Institute, and the American Society of Civil Engineers.
Chapter 23 Wood. This chapter provides minimum requirements for the design of buildings and structures that
use wood and wood-based products. The chapter is organized around three design methodologies: allowable stress
design (ASD), load and resistance factor design (LRFD) and conventional light-frame construction. Included in
the chapter are references to design and manufacturing standards for various wood and wood-based products;
general construction requirements; design criteria for lateral force-resisting systems and specific requirements for
the application of the three design methods. In general, only Type III, IV or V buildings may be constructed of
wood.
Chapter 24 Glass and Glazing. This chapter establishes regulations for glass and glazing that, when installed in
buildings and structures, are subjected to wind, snow and dead loads. Engineering and design requirements are
included in the chapter. Additional structural requirements are found in Chapter 16. [partial shown]
Chapter 25 Gypsum Board, Gypsum Panel Products and Plaster. Chapter 25 contains the provisions and
referenced standards that regulate the design, construction and quality of gypsum board, gypsum panel products
and plaster. It also addresses reinforced gypsum concrete. These represent the most common interior and exterior
finish materials in the building industry. This chapter primarily addresses quality-control-related issues with
regard to material specifications and installation requirements. Most products are manufactured under the control
of industry standards. The building official or inspector primarily needs to verify that the appropriate product is
used and properly installed for the intended use and location. While often simply used as wall and ceiling
coverings, proper design and application are necessary to provide weather resistance and required fire protection
for both structural and nonstructural building components.
Chapter 26 Plastic. [partial shown] The use of plastics in building construction and components is addressed in
Chapter 26. This chapter provides standards addressing foam plastic insulation, foam plastics used as interior

finish and trim, and other plastic veneers used on the inside or outside of a building. Plastic siding is regulated by
Chapter 14. Sections 2606 through 2611 address the use of light-transmitting plastics in various configurations
such as walls, roof panels, skylights, signs and as glazing. Requirements for the use of fiber-reinforced polymers,
fiberglass-reinforced polymers and reflective plastic core insulation are also contained in this chapter.
Additionally, requirements specific to the use of wood-plastic composites and plastic lumber are contained in this
chapter. The requirements and limitations of this chapter are necessary to control the use of plastic and foam
plastic products such that they do not compromise the safety of building occupants.
Chapter 31 Special Construction. Chapter 31 contains a collection of regulations for a variety of unique
structures and architectural features. Pedestrian walkways and tunnels connecting two buildings are addressed in
Section 3104. Membrane and air-supported structures are addressed by Section 3102. Safeguards for swimming
pool safety are
addressed by way of reference to the International Swimming Pool and Spa Code (ISPSC) in Section 3109.
Standards for temporary structures, including permit requirements are provided in Section 3103. Structures as
varied as awnings, marquees, signs, telecommunication and broadcast towers and automatic vehicular gates are
also addressed (see Sections 3105 through 3108 and 3110).
Chapter 35 Referenced Standards. [partial shown] The code contains numerous references to standards that are
used to regulate materials and methods of construction. Chapter 35 contains a comprehensive list of all standards
that are referenced in the code, including the appendices. Compliance with the referenced standard is necessary for
compliance with this code. By providing specifically adopted standards, the construction and installation
requirements necessary for compliance with the code can be readily determined. The basis for code compliance is,
therefore, established and available on an equal basis to the building code official, contractor, designer and owner.
Appendix I Patio Covers. Appendix I provides standards applicable to the construction and use of patio covers. It
is limited in application to patio covers accessory to dwelling units. Covers of patios and other outdoor areas
associated with restaurants, mercantile buildings, offices, nursing homes or other nondwelling occupancies would
be subject to standards in the main code and not this appendix.
Appendix H Signs. Appendix H gathers in one place the various code standards that regulate the construction and
protection of outdoor signs. Whenever possible, the appendix provides standards in performance language, thus
allowing the widest possible application.

User Note: The magnitude of design wind loads is based on the risk category assigned to the building. The
following sections provide details on assigning a risk category. While a building is generally assigned the
highest risk category for any occupancy, there is an exception for storm shelters (Risk Category IV) within a
building unless the storm shelter is a designated emergency shelter as defined in Table 1604.5. Table 1604.5
provides a listing of risk categories versus the nature of the occupancy.
1604.5 Risk category. Each building and structure shall be assigned a risk category in accordance with
Table 1604.5. Where a referenced standard specifies an occupancy category, the risk category shall not be
taken as lower than the occupancy category specified therein. Where a referenced standard specifies that the
assignment of a risk category be in accordance with ASCE 7, Table 1.5-1, Table 1604.5 shall be used in lieu
of ASCE 7, Table 1.5-1.
1604.5.1 Multiple occupancies. Where a building or structure is occupied by two or more occupancies not
included in the same risk category, it shall be assigned the classification of the highest risk category
corresponding to the various occupancies. Where buildings or structures have two or more portions that are
structurally separated, each portion shall be separately classified. Where a separated portion of a building or
structure provides required access to, required egress from or shares life safety components with another
portion having a higher risk category, both portions shall be assigned to the higher risk category.
        Exception: Where a storm shelter designed and constructed in accordance with ICC 500 is provided
        in a building, structure or portion thereof normally occupied for other purposes, the risk category for
        the normal occupancy of the building shall apply unless the storm shelter is a designated emergency
        shelter in accordance with Table 1604.5.
