Glazing Systems:
                                       1. Describe the risks that can be

                                       commercial glazing installations
                                       and review the lack of quality
years, it’s gotta be right?            control construction procedures
                                       that are needed industry wide to
                                       elevate installer performance.

                                       2. Explain how a systems approach
                                       that utilizes industry best practices
                                       when executed with process
                                       controls for glazing contractor shop
                                       and field operations can greatly
                                       improve glazing project outcomes.

                                       3. Discuss the connection of
                                       installation practices to the overall
                                       performance of building enclosure
                                       to provide manufacturers intended
                                       system aesthetics, safety, and
                                       performance.

                                       4. Summarize the NACC and AGMT
                                       certifications and collaboration

     • INTERFACES
     • PERIMETER JOINTS
     • glazing system

• Installers need to understand
  INTERRELATIONS OF SYSTEMS
Can glazing installations be improved through process controls?

What does process control mean?

Quality control in glazing, substrates, interfaces, and air barriers

Why is this important for whole building enclosure?
Common challenges we see in glazing

• Current SPECIFICATIONS do not adequately address INSTALLER
 QUALIFICATIONS
• The glazing industry does not have CONSISTENT STANDARDS FOR
 GLAZIER KNOWLEDGE
• Systems and their applications have become more complicated requiring
  TECHNICAL EXPERTISE and adequate PROCESS CONTROL to create
  consistent outcomes

• ROOT CAUSES OF ISSUES ARE CARRIED FORWARD
• Design Flaws
• CONSTRUCTION DEFECTS
• Poor WORKMANSHIP
• INSTALLATION ERRORS
• System/Product Failures
• Maintenance After Installation



 COMMON REASONS WHY BUILDING ENCLOSURES FAIL
Doug is on this project

Been here 30 years!!!

 Q: How do you know the frame
 is being assembled correctly?

 A: Doug is the foreman on this
 job. He makes sure it is right.
          Industry reliance on:
      “the people are the process”
       This is not process-control!
How informed is Doug?
• Project kick-off meetings
• Estimator to PM handoff
• Submittals for shop drawings
• Product Submittals
• The list goes on
• One competent mechanic can not make up for lack of processes

             Checklists
Four generations after the first aviation checklist
was put into use a lesson is emerging: checklists
seem to defend anyone, even the experienced,
against failure in many more tasks than we
realized. THEY PROVIDE A KIND OF COGNITIVE
NET. THEY CATCH MENTAL FLAWS inherent to all
of us – flaws in memory and ATTENTION TO
THOROUGHNESS. And because they do, they
raise wide, unexpected possibilities.
