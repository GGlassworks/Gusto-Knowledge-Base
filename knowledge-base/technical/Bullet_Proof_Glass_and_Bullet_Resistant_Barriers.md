BULLET PROOF GLASS - Meaning

Bullet resistant glass refers to any type of glass that is built to stand up against
being penetrated by bullets. Although the public uses the term ‘bullet proof glass’,
generally within the industry itself it is referred to as bullet-resistant glass,
because there is no feasible way to create consumer-level glass that can truly be
proof against bullets.

Bullet proof glass is usually constructed using a strong but transparent material
such as polycarbonate thermoplastic and by using layers of Laminated Glass. The
desired result is a material with an appearance and light-transmitting behavior of
standard glass but offers varying degrees of protection from small arms.

communicate with the tellers.


1930
First Used in Expensive Cars
Used in cars, though not widely due to it's price.


1953
Polycarbonates Discovered
Polycarbonates, a group of clear and easily moldable plastics, were discovered by scientists H.
Schnell (in Germany) and D. W. Fox (in the US). As Mr. Fox worked for GE, polycarbonates
began to be used in commercial products in the late 1950's.

Advancement

The field of bullet proof glass is constantly developing, and there are a number of military
projects underway to create lighter-weight, more defensive forms of bullet proof glass. One of
the most promising is the use of aluminum oxynitride in the outer layer, in place of a polymer
layer. Aluminium Oxynitride is 4 times stronger than silica glass and 85% as strong as sapphire.

U.S. military researchers are moving quickly to develop this new class of transparent armor
incorporating aluminum oxynisstride (Trade name: ALON) as the outside "strike plate" layer. It
performs much better than traditional glass/polymer laminates. Aluminum oxynitride "glass"
can’t defeat threats like the .50 caliber armor piercing rounds using material that is not
prohibitively heavy. This more resistant-glass that can be used in military assault vehicles and
aircraft.

UNDERSTANDING - BULLET PROOF GLASS


 Need to understand

         • Bullet

         • Glass

         • Barrier

GOLD PLUS GLASS INDUSTRY LIMITED
    WHAT’S INSIDE A BULLET

• Bullets are arranged in three system
   – The primer (like a fuse)
   – The propellant (chemical explosive)
   – The bullet proper (tapering metal cylinder)




  GOLD PLUS GLASS INDUSTRY LIMITED
   WHAT HAPPENS WHEN BULLET IS FIRED

• Primer ignites the propellant – (main explosives)
• It generates lot of gas very quickly and gas shoots from the back of
  bullet and increasing pressure and focusing gun barrier at high speed
  (300 m/s)
• Gun barrel have spiraling grooves that makes bullet spin it leaves
• A spinning bullet is like gyroscope &it follows straight path
• But due to different force acting on bullet,
• It follows downward curve



  GOLD PLUS GLASS INDUSTRY LIMITED
    KINETIC ENERGY OF BULLET
• Kinetic energy is the energy of motion.
• There are different form of energy.
• Bullet has translational kinetic energy.
• This depends upon mass (m) and speed (v) of the bullet.
• Kinetic energy = 0.5 X m X v2
• Kinetic energy is directly proportional to the square of speed.
• Two fold increase in speed, kinetic energy will increase by a factor of
  four.
• Standard unit of kinetic energy is Joule.
• 1 Joule = 1KG X metre2/ sec2
• Bullet proof glass has to absorb kinetic energy.

 HOW BULLET PROOF GLASS WORKS




GOLD PLUS GLASS INDUSTRY LIMITED
    PROCESS OF MANUFACTURING

• Bullet Proof Glass’ purpose is to place barrier in front of your body.
• Barrier will dissipate Bullet Energy.
• These are laminated glass, which is a sandwich of Glasses with a
  inter layer like Poly Vinyl Butyl and Poly Carbonate in between.




  GOLD PLUS GLASS INDUSTRY LIMITED
     PROCESS OF MANUFACTURING

• Bullet Glass is thicker (15mm to 70 mm) and is heavy depending
  upon the threat level.

• Bullet proof glass two type i.e.—Straight or curved glass

• Straight bullet proof glass is easier to make.

• Curved bullet proof glass you have to make mould.

• Bullet Glass is energy absorbing glass.

 PROCESS OF CURVED BULLET PROOF GLASS

• STEP 1: Making of glass moulds –
   – Moulds are an exact copy of curved glass with all curvature and bends. This mould is
     used in the bending process.
• STEP 2: Cutting and layout –
   – To cut the glass as per requirement along with sheet of polycarbonate and polyurethane
     bonding inter layers.
• STEP 3: Glass Bending –
   – Place the cut flat glass as per STEP 2 and set these on moulds in the bending ovens.
• STEP 4: Clean room assembly –
   – These bent glasses and layer of polyurethane bending interlayer are assembled in
     proper configuration.

PROCESS OF CURVED BULLET PROOF GLASS


•   STEP5: Vacuum bag assembly –

     – After stringent inspection, the full layup is then inserted into vacuum bag and sealed.

•   STEP 6: Autoclaving –

     – These are sent to autoclave and autoclave binds all of layers of polyurethane, glass and
        bonding interlayers.

•   STEP 7: Final inspection and packing –

     – Curved bullet glass are removed from the autoclave. It is checked against the moulds
        and original glass to see that glass fit properly. These are packed and ready for
        dispatch.
