Introduction
                                      The average public agency today uses cooperative purchasing
                                      for 20% of their spending. Procurement professionals are using
     Cooperative                      cooperatives twice as much as they did in 2010 and that number is
                                      growing. Why?

     purchasing:                      If you understand procurement, you know it is a challenging

                                      staff are leaner, working extra hours, and being asked to purchase

     since 2010
                                      more with stricter budgets. As a result, they are looking to
                                      cooperatives as an industry best practice to build out an additional
                                      purchasing arm for their teams.

                                      Procurement comes in many forms and fashions, ranging from
                                      a one-person team to a dedicated department of dozens. Public
                                      buyers can operate from one, centralized office or spread among
                                      different departments and branches they serve. Regardless of the
                                      structure, procurement matters and is required at all levels of a
                                      public organization.

                                      Procurement provides a competitive, fair, and transparent process
                                      to purchase goods and services. You put a lot of time and energy
                                      into your solicitations, and cooperative purchasing can help.

What is cooperative purchasing?




Cooperative purchasing is procurement conducted by, or on behalf of,
one or more government units for use by other government units.

Buying through a purchasing cooperative gives you access to
competitively solicited, ready-to-use awarded contracts. This saves
your procurement team time on the solicitation process, speeds up
contract creation and product delivery, and harnesses the buying
power of thousands of public agencies for better pricing.

                                                                        Aaron Carter, Assistant Vice

Using cooperative purchasing
Know your legal statutes
Sourcewell’s authority to offer cooperative contracts is governed by Minnesota statutes. Your authority to use cooperative
contracts is controlled by your local and state statutes. As a public agency representative, you must learn your state
and local statutes to understand your procurement requirements. Procurement professionals can usually find specific
guidance about cooperative purchasing or piggybacking in state or provincial code. Most states or provinces allow some
form of cooperative purchasing; however, your team must make a final determination.


Agency policy and procedures
Learn your internal policies and procedures, including your own procurement manuals, to determine your ability to use
cooperative purchasing organizations. Research the following:

    •   Does my organization currently use cooperative contracts?
    •   What are the requirements to receive approval to use a cooperative contract?
    •   What internal purchasing goals does my agency need to meet? Items for consideration:
            • Local preference
            • Best price
            • Minority- and women-owned businesses
            • Social goals
Connect with folks internally to learn more about these requirements and determine if a cooperative organization can
assist.


Cooperative considerations
Once you’ve determined your ability to use cooperative contracts, set aside time to evaluate the available cooperative
organizations. Meet your point of contact at each cooperative. Ask questions, provide feedback, and share your needs to
better understand what is available and the buying process. Items to consider:

    •    RFP process: How is the cooperative governed and does its competitive process mirror your own?
    •    Transparency: Can you easily access contract documentation and pricing?
    •    Registration: Are there fees or other requirements to use a cooperative?
    •    Customer service: Can the cooperative assist you with your needs?

                                              “A public organization makes decisions that are best for its constituents
                                              and its agency. One of those decisions is to use cooperative purchasing.
                                              Having a strategy for how to use it, when to use it, and how to get
                                              approval is important for procurement professionals and those who
                                              have a decentralized procurement process.”

                                        Some cooperatives allow you to add additional terms and
                                        conditions and/or subsequent agreements under the contract.
                                        As an agency representative, you and the supplier mutually
                                        agree to the additional language.

                                        Once you approve the purchase order, be sure to identify your
                                        agency’s cooperative account number as well as the supplier’s
                                        awarded contract number on your documentation. You can then
                                        verify the purchase came from a supplier using a competitively
                                        solicited cooperative contract.

Conclusion




As public procurement professionals continue to embrace cooperative purchasing as an industry best practice, they must
take critical steps to ensure successful use of supplier contracts. Creating a firm foundation with a cooperative partner
allows you to build strong supplier relationships that can lead to greater contract savings and cost reductions. Work with
folks who value a more positive experience, put your needs first, and strive to assist you and your agency procure smarter.


Key takeaways
    •   Cooperative purchasing accounts for 20% of public agency spending, making it a growing procurement strategy.
    •   Determine your authority to use cooperative purchasing by reviewing your agency’s policies, procedures, and laws.
    •   Buying through a cooperative streamlines procurement with pre-negotiated, competitively solicited contracts.
    •   Cooperative contracts harness the collective buying power of thousands of agencies, resulting in cost savings.
    •   Evaluate RFP competitiveness, documentation transparency, registration, and customer service before choosing.
