TILE SPECIFICS
1. The wear surface of the tile is called glaze.
2. Glazed tile is composed of two parts, called the bisque and the glaze.
3. Marble, granite and slate are taken from the earth, can be natural and mined from the earth.
4. Marble, granite and slate are taken from the earth and can be inconsistent in appearance.
5. The strength and wear resistance of the glaze is determined by its hardness.
6. Difference between glazed and unglazed tiles is that unglazed tiles are generally thicker and
    denser, superior strength for commercial use.
7. Non-vitreous tiles are suited for indoor use only because they absorb their weight in water by 7% or
    more.
8. Ceramic tile is known as glazed and unglazed.
9. The strongest tiles are known as impervious and absorb between 0 and 0.5% of their weight in
    water
10. P. E. I (Porcelain Enamel Institute) is the wear rating of the tile.
11. Quarry tiles are generally slip resistant and denser than other tiles.
12. Mosaic tiles are small and usually less than 9 square inches.
13. Impervious tile has water absorption of 0.5% or less.



INSTALLATION FACTS TO KNOW
1. ALWAYS follow the manufacturer’s installation instructions.
2. Wood expands and contracts when its moisture content changes
3. Backer boards replace the mortar beds and separate the tile from much of the structure’s movement
   to protect the installation.
4. Backer board installations will usually fail as the result of an insufficient amount of mortar
   underneath.
5. Lippage is the height difference between tiles that are adjacent to each other.
6. Deflection means to bend, flex or bow.
7. Most installations limit joist spacing to 16-inches on center.
8. In place of latex or acrylic caulks, use a flexible sealant, such as 100% silicone or urethane.

THE SUBSTRATE - SUBFLOOR
1. The substrate is known as the surface over which tile is installed.
2. Poured in place concrete is known as a substrate.
3. The performance of a properly installed thin-set tile installation is dependent upon the durability and
   dimensional stability of the substrate.
4. A cold or construction joint is when concrete is poured at different times and sections are joined
   together
5. CBU is the abbreviation for Cement Backer Units.
6. New, poured concrete can be tiled over according to industry recommendations in 28 days.
7. Wood products are dimensionally unstable because wood possesses tremendous movement
   characteristics
8. Wood based panels such as particle board, composition (veneer) panels, non-veneer panels (CDX,
   OSB, etc.), lauan and softwood plywood are NOT recommended as backing materials for direct
   bonding of tile.
9. 1/8-inch spacing is required at all end and edge joints of plywood subflooring for expansion,
   according to the APA Engineered Wood Association




                                                                                                             6
10. Stress cracks continue to open and close with seasonal changes
11. Non-asbestos cushioned or perimeter installed sheet vinyl goods should be removed.
12. Unsuitable substrates should be covered or replaced.
13. The amount of deflection in the floor is to be minimized to prevent failures where bending occurs
14. A measure of acidity or alkalinity is pH.
15. A pH under 9 is usually recommended for tile and grout to minimize efflorescence.
16. A calcium chloride test measures the vapor emission rate from a concrete slab over a 24-hour
    period, but it takes 60-72-hours to conduct. The emission rate is generally 3-pounds per 1,000
    square feet in 24-hours.
17. The In-Situ test measures the relative humidity of the slab to assess the moisture contained in the
    concrete that can potentially be emitted at the surface.
18. All methods require the subfloor to be at least 19/32” or 5/8” thick.
19. If the substrate is porous, damp mopping will increase the bond strength of the cement mortar to the
    substrate, as long as the substrate remains damp when the mortar is troweled.
20. In a concrete floor, expansion joints continue to open and close with seasonal changes.
21. Leave a minimum1/8-inch accommodation movement around all perimeter abutments and horizontal
    to      vertical abutments.
22. Structural wood panels with edges that interlock with other panels are known as tongue and groove
    and should have 1/8-inch expansion built into the system.

MORTAR and ADHESIVE
1. Today, most tile installations are done by using thin-bed methods.
2. Thin-bed installation is so common that newer buildings no longer accommodate the thickness of a
    mortar-bed installation.
3. Reduced mortar performance and open time are the result of mixing too little or too much.
4. One of the most common causes of tile failures is the lack of mortar coverage.
5. Joist spacing, tile size and type, underlayment type and subfloor thickness all affect tile
    performance.
6. Dry-set mortar is suitable for use over a variety of surfaces and can be used in one layer as thin as
    3/32-inch, which is the MINIMUM allowed.
7. Latex-portland cement mortar compared to dry set cement is more flexible.
8. If chemical resistance, high-bond strength and high-impact resistance are required, use an epoxy
    mortar.
9. Remove mortar from joint area before grouting, leaving 2/3’s of the depth of the tile available for
    grouting.
10. Back buttering is the term used for applying adhesive to the back of tiles that have large lugs or
    grooves.
11. Organic adhesive shrinks as it dries more than mortar and because of drying issues, can only be
    used on tiles that are no larger than 6x6 inches for floors and 12x12 inches for walls.
12. Latex additive mixed with dry set mortar instead of water and used when tiling over a non-porous
    subfloor is called a bond coat strengthener.
13. When latex additive is mixed with dry set mortar instead of water, the mortar is stronger.
14. Dry-set Portland-based cement mortar - standard term for cement-based mortar that does not
    contain polymers or latex.

MEMBRANES
1. An uncoupling membrane is a plastic sheet which is bonded to the substrate to accommodate
   movement.
2. A plastic membrane that provides air space between the tile and substrate to allow movement
   between the two is called the uncoupling membrane.
3. Uncoupling membranes are plastic sheet goods that are sold in a roll or as individual sheets and
   used throughout the entire installation.
4. A crack isolation membrane is a thin, flexible material adhered to concrete substrates and poured
   underlayment’s to prevent cracks in the substrate from telegraphing through the tile.




                                                                                                       7
5. A thin, flexible liquid material, applied to a substrate to minimize moisture/fracturing damage to the tile
   and grout and applied with a trowel, roller or sprayer is known as a waterproofing or anti-fracture
   membrane.
6. Typically, when covering a single crack in a concrete substrate, the width of the installed crack
   isolation membrane should be at least three times the width of the tile to be installed over the crack.

GROUT
1. A bad grout can ruin a perfect installation.
2. When mixing thin set and grout, it is important to follow the recommended mixing speed and slake
    time.
3. When mixing grout, use lower speeds. Mixing too fast or too long produces weaker grout if the air is
    trapped.
4. Minimizing the amount of water used will make the grout stronger.
5. When grouting, use the recommended joint sizes stated by the manufacturer.
6. After the thin-set has cured, the tile is ready to grout.
7. Portland cement is the base for most grouts.
8. Epoxy grouts provide high-bond strength and impact resistance.
9. Epoxy grout is used where chemical resistance is of high importance and provides a high-bond
    strength and impact resistance also.
10. If the grout becomes too stiff, remix it by hand, but do not add liquid.
11. Do not pack the grout into the movement joints.
12. Grout must be firm in the joints before beginning to rough wash.
13. Fill visible movement joints with a compressible material, but do not use grout.
14. Before the final wash, allow the grout film to dry to a haze.
15. Restrict the traffic in freshly grouted areas for 24-hours and no heavy traffic for 72 hours.

BONDING
1. To ensure proper mortar coverage of the tile and setting material check by lifting a tile and
   inspecting it.
2. If tile is bonded directly to concrete over a crack without a crack isolation membrane, it will most
   likely crack.
3. Tile installation may fail because the incorrect bonding material was used and/or by improper
   coverage of the correct bonding material.
4. If the mortar sets up too quickly, the bond strength will be much weaker.

INFORMATION CONCERNING EXPANSION JOINTS by Dave Gobis, Former Technical Director of
CTEF
Know the joint types: expansion, isolation, control and construction
1. Use recommended guidelines - TILE COUNCIL OF NORTH AMERICA HANDBOOK FOR
    CERAMIC TILE INSTALLATION specifies a particular method and is the accepted industry standard
    for tile installation. The manufacturers of the products and supplies provide instructions that are
    pertinent to each company. They are to be followed!
2. Numerous ceramic tile failures are created by movement. All tile moves; even the strongest steel
    or concrete must be addressed as to movement.
3. Tile expands when exposed to sunlight. Even the very dense porcelain tile expands
    approximately .0000004 inches per degree Fahrenheit. Example: Covering 40 linear feet exposed to
    a change in surface temperature of 50 degrees could possibly expand between 1/16” and 3/32”. The
    coverage and type of thin-set makes a big difference whether the tile stays in place.
4. AT THE TIME OF THE SALE, the need for movement joints in tile installation must be addressed.
    This is of much greater importance than the grout color.
5. Tile will expand and contract due to temperature variations.
6. Concrete shrinks! Control joints are placed primarily for concrete shrinkage during the initial curing
    process. If there are no control joints in the slab, the cracking occurs at random locations over a
    period of time.
7. Doorways: Install a movement joint just to be safe.
8. Moisture is a force on tile. Once moisture expands; it does not contract. The growth rate is very
    slow and very minimal. If this happens, it is usually due to defective workmanship; use of the wrong
    thin-set or insufficient full curing moisture exposure or no expansion (movement) joints. Failures due
    to moisture usually take years to occur unless there is a very high rate of water exposure.
9. Other good reasons for expansion joints include the fact that wood moves. All wood supported floor
    systems display deflection in some amount. If there is a beam down the center of an area this is a
    pivot point from which the floor will deform on either side. Place a soft joint or movement profile over
    the area to allow movement without creating stress on the tile floor.
10. Movement/expansion joints must be at all control joints. It is possible that tile may crack or
    debond if it is installed without the proper movement accommodation joints. Using a membrane does
    not eliminate the need for expansion joints.




                                                                                                             12
SECTION 3 – MEASURING – ESTIMATING – A SUCCESSFUL
BID
A. PREPARATION

   Preparation makes the difference! This includes all parties. The importance of the detailed drawing
   contributes to the overall success of the installation. The diagram “paints a picture” of what is expected
   to happen. Every time a job is PROPERLY planned, it is finished to everyone’s expectations. It is not
   guesswork! “If it doesn’t start right, it absolutely will NOT finish right!” Proper planning pays big
   dividends!

           THE “IF’S” THAT SATISFY CUSTOMERS…

               •    IF the flooring and installation are sold correctly,

               •    IF the customer has been properly prepared,

               •    IF the estimator has “painted the true picture” for the installation,

               •    IF the installer follows the detailed diagram,

           ANOTHER HAPPY CUSTOMER WILL RETURN TO PURCHASE FLOORING AGAIN!


B. COMMUNICATION WITH THE CUSTOMER – If it doesn’t start right, it will NOT finish right!
   Knowing what the customer expects from their flooring investment helps the installers to provide better
   service. Associates who develop a real partnership with installation professionals find they encounter
   fewer problems during and after the installation. Installation problems are minimized depending on the
   accuracy of the measurements and the care with which the details are recorded for the installer.

   Consider the numerous details in figuring a tile installation that must be properly planned and
   coordinated. A drawing is required in order to determine for the floor area:

               1.   Each area of installation                        9. Subfloor type
               2.   Type of tile                                     10. Appliances and furniture to more
               3.   Amount of tile                                   11. Stairs
               4.   Edge treatments                                  12. Movement areas
               5.   Floor preparation                                13. Pattern layout - diagonal
               6.   Required trim pieces                             14. Utility turnoffs - responsibility
               7.   Various accessories                              15. Customer requests
               8.   Door and appliance clearance

   Generally, for new construction, the installer receives architectural drawings with space names or
   number and a finished schedule of styles, patterns, colors and installation methods. Existing structures
   require new measurements and drawings. The estimator should use ¼-inch scaled graph paper and
   steel tape measure.




                                                                                                             13
C. CALCULATE THE AMOUNT OF TILE
      • Square off the area
      • Tile is sold by the FULL carton
      • To calculate the number of cartons
            o Divide the net square footage plus the waste factor by the square feet in a carton of
                 tile and round off to the next full carton
            o To determine the number of square feet to purchase, multiply the total number of
                 cartons by the square feet in one carton

D. THE ESTIMATING FORMULA

       1. SQUARE FOOTAGE FORMULATIONS
          a. Length times width = square footage of area
          b. Add 10% or 13% for waste
          c. Net square footage divided by the square feet in carton = full and partial number of
             cartons
          d. Round off to the next full carton = exact full cartons
          e. Full cartons times square feet per box = total square feet

       EXAMPLE:
            Facts:              Area is 20 feet long and 15 feet wide
                                Tile is packed 16.1 square feet to one carton
               Answer:
                                a.   20 feet times 15 feet = 300 square feet of area
                                b.   300 square feet times 1.10 = 330 square feet
                                c.   330 divided by 16.1 square feet = 20.49 cartons
                                d.   Rounded off = 21 cartons
                                e.   21 cartons times 16.1 square feet = 338.1 total square feet

E. CUT-TILE BASE FORMULATION

   Length of wall divided by 2 = number of square (30 L/F = 15 S/F)

   NOTE:       This formulation is never exact because you are working with different size tiles, but it is
               easy and avoids potential problems


F. TRIM (Bullnose) FORMULATION
      1. Linear feet of area times 12 = linear inches
      2. Linear inches divided by the length of bullnose = number of pieces

       EXAMPLE:
            Facts:              Area receiving bull nose is 10 feet in length
                                This particular bull nose is 6-inches long
               Answer           a. 10 feet times 12 inches = 120 inches
                                b. 120 inches divided by 6 = 20 pieces




                                                                                                          14
G. VINYL CAP FORMULATION
      Linear feet divided by 6 feet = number of pieces - Vinyl cap is available in 6-foot lengths


H. MARBLE THRESHOLD FORMULATION
     Measure linear feet of doorway - Use the next larger size and cut it to fit


I.   MEASURING FOR DOOR CLEARANCE FORMULATION
       Door should clear height of two tiles. Lay one tile on top of another. Always verify before cutting.


J. STEPS and RISER (Combined) FORMULATION
      Width of steps times the number of steps = linear feet


K. CEMENT BACKBOARD FORMULATION
     Area square foot divided by square foot of board = number of sheets


L. DIAGRAM MUST SHOW THE MOVEMENT AREAS


M. BALANCING A TILE INSTALLATION
   There is more to consider than a square room. Considerations include entrances, doorways,
   adjoining rooms, fireplaces, built-ins


N. DIAGRAM MUST SHOW PATTERNS and DIFFERENT SIZES of TILE




                                                                                                         15
SECTION 4 – Moisture – Alkalinity – Porosity - Humidity
It is not the responsibility of the installer to conduct moisture testing, but it is the installer’s
responsibility to make certain that the moisture tests were conducted and the results are
documented for future reference. (Industry White Paper ----www.CFIinstallers.org)

WHITE PAPER on Moisture Emission Testing www.wfca.org Position statement on moisture emission
testing and accompanying document, “Moisture Emission Testing – Responsibility and Qualifications for
Testing” adopted by the World Floor Covering Association (WFCA) Board of Directors to begin the process
of soliciting industry-wide support for the measure. The focus of the position statement is that concrete
moisture vapor testing needs to be performed by qualified independent agencies, and not by floor covering
personnel. This recommendation, if adopted, will require that architects move such testing away from
Division 9 of Construction Specifications and place it with other construction-related test
requirements. Building industry practice historically has been that floor-covering installers, dealers and
contractors have been held accountable for testing of moisture emissions in concrete and the satisfactory
installation of floor covering on this material. Horror stories abound about floor covering professionals
being held liable for non-performance, often in extenuating circumstances beyond their control.
Compounding complexity of the situation are technological advancements in concrete formulations, as well
as new, “fast track” construction techniques. It was in this environment that the Ad Hoc Task Force of
interested professionals was brought together by WFCA to attempt to rectify what has proven to be a
serious problem. That led to the development of the “Position Statement on Moisture Emission Testing”
that was finalized in 2001.             Document is available online at www.WFCA.org and at
www.CFIinstallers.org.

MOISTURE – ALKALINITY – POROSITY - HUMIDITY

    1. It is not the responsibility of the installer to conduct moisture testing, but it is the installer’s
       responsibility to make certain that the moisture tests were conducted and the results are
       documented for future reference.
    2. Calcium Chloride testing ASTM 1869
    3. In-situ rH probe testing ASTM 2170
    4. MAT TEST is a qualitative test that ONLY checks for moisture using a plastic or rubber mat left in
       place for 48-hours.
             a. Test for moisture by trapping it under a plastic or rubber mat.
             b. Clean the floor where the mat is to be placed, DO NOT wet mop the floor; this will create
       moisture.
             c. Place the mat on the floor and tape it on all sides with duct tape, sealing all edges.
             d. Leave the mat in place for 48-hours and then remove. Performing the test in less time,
                 allows for the margin of error to increase.
             e. Look for droplets of moisture and changes in the appearance of the floor when the mat is
       removed.
             f. Consider: Is the surface drying (whitening)? Is the duct tape stuck to the floor? If the
                 duct tape is loose or will hardly stick to the floor, this may be an indication of a moisture
                 condition.
    5. Efflorescence – residue deposited on the surface of a material by the crystallization of soluble
       salts.




                                                                                                           16
Understanding “pH”
For many years, the Industry has looked upon moisture as being the primary contributor to flooring failures.
As the Industry has become more knowledgeable with information gathered from some specialists in the
field, it has been discovered that the pH level of a concrete substrate has a significant bearing on the
success or failure of applied floor coverings, such as ceramic tile, carpet, VCT, hardwood, etc.

    1. A measure of acidity or alkalinity is pH. A pH under 9 is usually recommended. pH of concrete
       neutral is 7. Strong salt (alkali) is represented by a 14 reading.
    2. A calcium chloride test measures the vapor emission rate which is generally 3-pounds per
       1,000 square feet in 24-hours.
           a. pH tests determine the strength of salts, known as a base or the strength of acids in a
               substance, whether in a liquid or solid state.
           b. An aqueous solution, which is pure water (distilled) is applied to the substrate and
               tested by the use of litmus paper or electronic meters. Test results will determine the
               value of acid or alkali (salts) present in concrete.
           c. Alkali migrates to the surface through the capillaries in the concrete. Water in vapor
               form is the transport. Alkali can be present in the ground or in the aggregate mix.
           d. The pH scale is logarithmic; the intervals are exponential and thus, represent far
               greater differences in concentration than the values themselves seem to indicate – each
               interval is 10 times itself starting from 7. The pH measures hydrogen-ion concentration of
               solution.
           e. pH tests are conducted at the same time on floors free of sealers and contaminants. 3
               tests are taken for the first 1000 square feet and one additional test for every 1000 feet
               thereafter.

TESTING the pH of CONCRETE
   • The pH scale is from 0-14
   • 7 is neutral
   • 1 is a strong acid
   • 14 is a strong salt (alkali) or base

THREE TYPES OF TESTS
   1. PH paper – Litmus
   2. Liquid Indicators
          a. Phenolphthalein liquid - turns red with higher pH or pink with lower pH
          b. Rainbow indicator - reacts to the different values of pH
          c. pH pencil - reacts to different values of pH
   3. Electronic Surface Probes - Digital displays

PROCEDURES TO CONDUCT a pH TEST
   1. Test is to be conducted at the same time as the moisture test
   2. Floor must be free of any sealers or contaminants
   3. Take three tests for first 1000 square feet
   4. Take one additional test for every 1000 square feet
   5. Use distilled water for litmus paper
   6. Use a buffered solution for electronic test
   7. Phenolphthalein or liquid solutions – pour directly onto slab – can be toxic
   8. pH turns red with phenolphthalein
   9. pH turns different shades with rainbow Indicator




                                                                                                         17
MOISTURE TESTS

    pH TEST

        •   PAPER STRIPS: Place a few drops, one inch in diameter, of distilled water on the area to be
            tested. Wait 60 seconds, place a strip of pH paper on the wet area and remove immediately,
            after which time the color of the paper is compared to the chart that came with the
            paper. Record the findings.

        •   pH METER: Either mist or place a few drops of distilled water on the area to be tested. The
            less water, the more accurate the testing. Hold the testing end of the meter against the
            dampened area until the meter stabilizes. Read the meter and record the findings. Before
            testing another area, clean the end of the probe with a clean towel.

POROSITY
   1. The more porous the slab, the more vapor migration occurs
   2. The more porous the slab, the less open-time for adhesive. Webster’s Dictionary explains
      porosity as “possessing or full of pores – permeable to liquids” Porosity has a direct affect on
      adhesives. When conducting pH testing, one can determine the porosity of a slab by watching
      the water that was applied for the pH:

            •   If the water absorbs quickly – the slab is porous
            •   If the water does not absorb – slab has a low porosity
            •   The more porous the slab, the less open time for adhesive-moisture
            •   Moisture from the adhesive will absorb into the slab
            •   The lower the porosity, the longer the open-time is for adhesives
            •   Moisture needs to evaporate from adhesive, rather than being absorbed into concrete
            •   Water cement ratios and on-site finishing methods are two key factors determining the
                amount of porosity a concrete slab displays.

DEW POINT (condensation)

Dew Point is another factor that comes into play with all the other concerns regarding moisture, pH and
concrete science. Dew Point is the temperature at which condensation forms.



HUMIDITY
    •   Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air and can be described in different ways.
    •   Relative humidity is the term used most often in weather information for the public.
    •   Relative humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air compared with the amount of vapor
        needed to make the air saturated at the air’s current temperature or more simply; the amount of
        moisture in the air in percentage.




                                                                                                          18
PATCHING COMPOUNDS

    1. GYSUM BASED: White in color – lower psi rating – susceptible to mold and mildew. Expands
       during dry out and expands with moisture after it is cured.
    2. PORTLAND BASED or CEMENTITIOUS: Usually gray in color – higher psi rating – will not
       promote mold and mildew may shrink during dry out period - may need to apply a second coat
    3. SELF-LEVELING COMPOUNDS: Used for irregular substrates

SEALER – PENETRANTS
   1. Liquid sealers / penetrants are top coatings for a concrete slab and reduce the amount of vapor
      emissions by filling in the capillaries – usually silicate-based.
   2. NOT all sealers are ready for floor coverings within 24-72 hours
   3. Sealers address moisture, but not all are resistant to pH and can react with certain adhesives,
      causing a failure.

REMOVAL of EXISTING FLOORING

    Proper precaution and OSHA procedures must be taken if there is an existing floor covering that may
    contain ASBESTOS. If in doubt, assume that flooring contains asbestos until properly tested.

    For existing and remodel projects, removal must be addressed at the time of the sale! This is
    critical to the success of the installation!

    A salesperson who is knowledgeable can direct the end user in the right direction and offer the proper
    corrective procedures, resulting in a successful sale AND installation.
    Asbestos removal systems should be used by abatement companies. The majority of installation firms
    are not experienced or qualified concerning the chemicals necessary for removal or the proper
    techniques and disposal methods. CFI suggests that a recognized abatement firm be contacted.



SECTION 5 – Grade Levels
It is very important to be aware of the grade level so the correct flooring will be used.

IMPORTANT: ALWAYS follow manufacturer guidelines! NOTE: If there is more than 3” of soil
against any wall, the entire level is considered to be BELOW grade.

SUBFLOOR GRADE LEVELS
Ground should be sloped away from the house (3” in 10’) for proper drainage

    •   ABOVE GRADE
    •   ON GRADE
    •   BELOW GRADE

GRADE LEVEL
  1. If there is more than 3” of soil against any wall, the entire level is considered to be BELOW
     grade.
  2. Ground should be sloped away from the house (3” in 10’) for proper drainage
  3. Three grade levels are recognized as above-grade, on-grade and below grade.
  4. Prior to installing flooring, concrete slabs must cure for a minimum of 90-120 days unless the
     manufacturer states otherwise.
  5. Before beginning moisture testing, slab should be cured a minimum of 30 days (check with
     manufacturer)
  6. Tolerance should be flat to within 1/4” in 10-feet 1/16” in 1-foot.
  7. Slabs on, above, below grade, and lightweight concrete should have a vapor retarder installed.




                                                                                                       19
Onsite Conditions
   1. Building should be closed in and outside doors and windows must be in place.
   2. In warm months the building must be well ventilated.
   3. Basements must be dry and well-ventilated.
   4. Crawl space must be dry and must be a minimum of 18” from ground to underside of joists with
       perimeter venting.




SECTION 6 – SUBFLOOR TYPES
A. SUBLFOOR TYPES - IMPORTANT INFORMATION
   According to the IRC (International Residential Code) and the IBC (International Building Codes), the
   general contractor must provide a suitable subfloor for the tile installer. (TCNA Handbook)
   The installation of direct bonding of tile to a wood board subfloor, plywood, OSB and particleboard is
   considered by the ceramic tile industry as a high-risk-of-failure installation.

    1. SUBFLOOR GUIDELINES - CONCRETE
       a. Concrete slabs shall be cured for a MINIMUM of 28 days before ceramic tile can be installed.
           ALWAYS KNOW the manufacturer’s requirements.
       b. Subfloor must be flat, dry, sound, clean and free of abrupt highs and lows.
       c. Tolerance should be flat to within 1/4" in 10-feet, 1/16” in 1-foot
       d. High spots should be ground down with grinder with dust containment system.
       e. Low spots must be filled in with a proper leveling compound.
          RULE OF THUMB:
           • Draw a nail across the top. If it leaves an indentation, it is probably lightweight concrete
           • Slabs on, above, below grade, and lightweight concrete should have a vapor retarder
              installed.

    2. PLYWOOD SUBFLOOR SPECIFICS
       a. The problem with bonding tile to wood products is NOT in bonding to the wood, because the
          bond is achieved, but the tremendous movement characteristics of wood itself as
          dimensionally unstable.
       b. The wood products expand and contract creating problems.
       c. Moisture, type of wood, relative humidity, installation on interior or exterior and how well the
          wood is nailed or adhered affect the amount of movement.
       d. Tile is brittle and requires a dimensionally stable surface upon which to be bonded.
       e. This problem can be corrected by applying a mortar bed or cement backer board. Each of
          these provides a dimensionally stable substrate and is more serviceable and compatible for
          ceramic tile.

    3. GYPSUM BOARD (DRY WALL)
       a. Typically installed on walls and tiling over it in a dry area is acceptable.
       b. Use a dry set mortar or an organic adhesive (mastic) to bond the tile to the surface
       c. Not suitable for a wet area, such as a tub or shower. Water will deteriorate the gypsum and
          result in a failure
       d. Use water-resistant gypsum board in wet areas. However for a longer, lasting installation, a
          mortar bed or cement backer board can be applied over the gypsum in these areas. Consult
          the TCNA Handbook for the best method of application




                                                                                                        20
    4. CEMENT BACKER UNIT (CBU)
       a. Generally consists of portland cement, aggregate and fiberglass mesh exterior available in
          various sizes
       b. May be applied over wood studs on walls, over plywood subfloor, over counter tops, over
          gypsum wall board or almost anywhere that a mortar bed can be used.
       c. Cement backer board is the next alternative to use when the wire reinforced mortar bed
          behind ceramic tile is not possible or time constraints will not allow.
       d. Always follow the manufacturer’s specifications for installation.
       e. The preferred method of attaching the panels is with manufacturer-recommended screws or
          galvanized nails with a minimum penetration of ¾-inch into the substrate.
       f. Cover the joints of the board with “alkali-resistant” fiberglass mesh tape and a coat of bonding
          material applied over and under the tape.
       g. CONCERN: The CBU will mirror whatever surface placed over it. It is critical to inspect the
          substrate and check for irregularities such as high spots, depressions and other imperfections
          that may create a potential problem. These must be removed or filled to achieve a flat
          installation.
       h. It is also critical that the joints be taped and coated with mortar per the manufacturer’s
          instructions. If not done, cracking may develop along the joints of the board resulting in
          repair work and an unhappy customer.

B. Treatments and corrective procedures
   The special treatments or corrective procedures should not be confusing. They are easily
understood:
       • Cover or replace unsuitable substrates
       • When installing over substrates that tend to move slightly, use an elastic mortar (latex or
            acrylic) that bends rather than breaks
       • Roughen up hard-to-bond surfaces
       • Cover cracks with a membrane



SECTION 7 – Basic Overview of Ceramic Tile prepared by Dave Gobis,
Industry Consultant

Poorly prepared substrates and the use of improper setting materials are the cause of many major
installation failures. Not all latex and acrylic additives are designed to do the same job. For example, some
are not recommended over plywood.

Thousands of tiles are made worldwide. The sale of tile products has escalated during the past ten years
and is expected to continue. Ceramic tile has many advantages. It is available in a multitude of colors,
shapes, sizes, textures, glosses, and features. This variety lends itself to an unlimited spectrum of design
possibilities. Many tiles are available in “modular sizes” with grout joints that line up with various sized tiles.
Tile lasts for a long time.

Tile can be installed floors, walls, countertops, ceilings, pools, tubs, showers, outside walls, even moving
surfaces as found in motor homes and boats can be tiled. But the tile must be properly selected and properly
installed. Substrate selection and preparation are of vital importance.

A complete lesson on tile is not possible in this article but there are a few basics. One concern is to use
proper wear ratings for areas exposed to traffic. A simple chart inserted here can be used as a guide for
consumer selection. This chart refers to glazed tile products only; don’t oversell the product especially in
the case of porcelain. Glazed porcelain is glazed porcelain; you walk on the glaze, not the body.




                                                                                                                21
There are six ratings that outline the recommended use that can be achieved by the glazed tile wear test
(0 to V).
     O. Decorative only with no use on floors
     I. Light foot traffic without scratching dirt and direct outside access, such as residential bath
     II. Residential areas without exposure to abnormal footwear or outside access
     III. Normal residential areas and normal footwear and traffic
     IV. Commercial foot traffic such as entrances, kitchens, offices and sales rooms
     V. Areas subjected to severe pedestrian traffic such as airports, shopping centers, hotel foyers, public
          walkways, and industrial applications.

The adhesives and grouts must be properly selected for the type of tile, surface to receive the installation,
and expected use. Above all, don’t oversell the product or installation system. The industry standards are
published and available from the Tile Council of America at www.tileusa.com or by calling (864) 646.8453.
These guide you toward proper recommendations. Certain construction techniques and building materials
are either not compatible with ceramic tile or require additional attention to detail.

Deflection of the substrate (the surface to which the tile is bonded) must be less than L/360. This simple
statement means that any span or section of span must not deflect with the expected static and dynamic
loads more then the length of the span (L) divided by 360. Static loads are furniture, cabinets, appliances
and other normally not moving objects while dynamic loads include people, dogs, moving objects, etc.

There are three main categories of tile work failures. The first is the deflection mentioned above and this is
rectified by adding strength to the system such as a second sheet of plywood. Second, is the lack of
coverage of the setting material. The standards require at least 80% of the tile in dry areas, on an average
to be covered by adhesive and bonded with no voids (air trapped beneath the tile). In wet areas such as
showers and tubs, the requirement is for 95% coverage. This is harder to do with larger tiles and has
become a greater problem recently. Tiles greater than 8” x 8” need to have the trapped air released from
underneath.

Third, there must be an allowance for movement. This is done by using soft joints (caulk) instead of hard
grout in the required places. These places include intersecting planes (walls and floors for example),
between dissimilar materials (fiberglass, metal, wood floors, etc.), and in large areas of tile (this varies with
the potential changes in the ambient temperature). Put, buildings move and materials expand and contract
with temperature, moisture, wind load, and other factors and allowances must be made for this movement.

The Tile Council of America has been publishing the Handbook for Ceramic Tile Installation for 41 years.
This industry consensus publication shows the tried and true details for tile installation. It does not cover
every situation and is not a DIY instruction book. However, by following the methods, the possibility of
failures is reduced. This does not mean that other methods will fail, but the person doing things their own
way by designing their own system is taking a big chance. The TCA also publishes the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) standards for ceramic tile and for the installation of tile. These are critical
documents to obtain, read and use. Many architects rely on these standards for their specifications. As
always, local practices and building codes prevail over these standards.




                                                                                                              22
CERAMIC TILE CHARACTERISTICS

    GLAZED CERAMIC TILE
    These tiles are made up of two parts – the body, which is called the BISQUE, and the surface, which is
    called the GLAZE. The ingredients are all natural materials mined from the earth. The main ingredient
    is clay. Types of materials vary from company to company, but include such elements as quartz, kaolin,
    fritz, dolomite, cobalt selenium and talc. The manufacturing of single-fired glaze tile can be broken down
    into five parts: mixing, molding, glazing, firing and completion.

    All the raw materials that are used to manufacturer ceramics come from the earth, including the color of
    the glaze. While man has been successful in finding ways to improve most products by substituting
    natural materials with synthetics, they have not been able to improve on the quality of raw materials
    found in ceramics, which have remained unchanged for thousands of years.

IMPORTANT: In order to use the proper thin-set materials, the installer must possess the knowledge of
the different types and installation requirements of each type of tile.

TWO BASIC GROUPS

            Glazed tiles    These are made the same as unglazed tiles except that a glass wear layer,
                            called a glaze is fused to its surface by means of tremendous heat.

            Unglazed tiles True inlaid; simply baked pieces of clay where colors run throughout the body of
the tile.

FEATURES
A. GLAZED TILES

            1. Most glazed tiles are NOT suited for heavy commercial installations. They are generally
            suited for light residential to medium commercial use. There are exceptions. Technology for
            glazes has improved dramatically. New glazes are hard and durable enough for heavy use.

            2. ADVANTAGES of GLAZED TILES
            The glaze offers the manufacturers the ability to produce an unlimited array of beautiful colors
            and designs.
            The non-porous glaze creates a smooth surface that is practically stain proof.

            3. FACTS ABOUT THE GLAZE
            The glaze is a liquid glass that has been sprayed or poured onto the surface of the tile. It is then
            fused and hardened by strong heat. The colors of glaze are made from a mixture of minerals
            such as gold, silver, zinc, copper, mercury, cobalt and others.

            4. HARDNESS
            The strength and wear resistance of the tile is determined by its hardness.
               • Temperature – the higher the kiln (oven) temperature, the harder the glaze.
               • Color – Dark color glazes, such as blacks and blues are usually softer than light colored
                    ones.
               • Gloss levels – shiny glazes are usually softer than mat or satin finished glazes.

B. UNGLAZED TILES

            1. DESCRIPTION
               Superior strength for heavy commercial use as well as residential; the rugged surface texture
               and mat finish of the unglazed tile give them good “slip resistant” qualities for use in wet
               areas.




                                                                                                               23
          These tiles are the workhorse of the industry. They are generally thicker and denser than
          glazed tiles. They include such products as quarry tiles and porcelains.

          The tough inlaid qualities of most unglazed tiles make them ideally suited for, but not limited
          to, extra heavy commercial installations. Many customers appreciate the natural qualities
          and beauty of unglazed tiles for residential use.

          The color in the tiles is generally limited to the natural colors of clay….ranging from light sand
          to a red brick tone, with exceptions. Manufacturers achieve a wide range of beautiful colors
          by mixing color pigments in with the clay.

      2. ADVANTAGES
         Superior strength for heavy commercial use as well as residential; the rugged surface texture
         and the mat finish give them good “slip resistant” qualities for wet areas.

      3. FACTS ABOUT CLAY
         The clay body, also called the BISQUE, is made up of various types of clay and other
         minerals. Combined, these raw materials give the BISQUE its strength and stability, which is
         also determined by its density. The strongest BISQUES are for heavy commercial
         installations have the smallest and fewest number of air pockets.

      4. TILE DENSITY
         The density of the clay also determines if the tile is suitable for outdoor use. Tiles that are too
         porous, absorbing more than 3% moisture will freeze and crack if installed outdoors in cold
         climates. The density of the tile is measured by the amount of water it absorbs. The labels
         state where the tile may be used and if it is frost resistant.

          a. NON-VITREOUS TILES – absorb 7% or more of their weight in water – for indoor use
             only
          b. SEMI-VITREOUS TILES – absorb 3-7% water – suited for indoor use only.
          c. VITREOUS TILES – absorb 0.5% - 3% water – suited for interior and exterior use (frost
             resistant).
          d. IMPERVIOUS TILES are the strongest. They absorb between 0 – 0.5% of their weight in
             water.

      5. WEAR RATING SYSTEM – P.E.I.
         The Porcelain Enamel Institutes (P.E.I) rating has nothing to do with the price, only the
         durability. Some of the most expensive and luxurious tiles rate only I or II. The ratings go
         from Group I to Group IV+, with the IV+ Group being the most durable.

C. DESCRIPTION of POPULAR UNGLAZED TILES

      1. QUARRY TILE – Unglazed tiles made from clay and shale; colors limited to earth tones, but
         manufacturers add pigments to the clay to offer a wider color variety. Thick and dense; a
         popular choice for both heavy commercial and residential use. Surface is generally slip
         resistant.

      2. PORCELAIN TILES – Made of special clays and minerals similar to those found in China (fine
         dishes). Available in a wide range of colors; highly stain resistant and strong. Finish is plain,
         rough or polished. Ideal choice for heavy commercial and residential use.

      3. TERRA-COTTA TILES – Tiles are handmade or machine-made pavers. The machine-made
         tiles are much denser and can usually be installed outside as they are frost resistant. The most
         popular handmade tile is from Mexico (Saltillo) and are crudely made, vary in size, shade and
         texture, are very porous and must be sealed and waxed to prevent staining and wear.




                                                                                                         24
      4. MOSAIC TILES – Small tiles, less than 9 square inches in size, mounted on perforated sheets
         for easy installation. Usually, very dense, tough and highly stain resistant. Ideal for shower
         because the size allows flexibility to conform to the floor as it slopes to the drain. Toughness
         and stain resistance make them ideal for counter tops. Most are unglazed, but can be produced
         with a glaze.

D. DESCRIPTIONS of ADDITIONAL TILE

      1. MARBLE
         Marble is made from nature; it is not a man-made substrate and can be inconsistent. More
         veining can mean a stone may be more brittle and susceptible to breakage or fill removal, even
         after installation. Marbles have voids and faults filled with cement and epoxy prior to shipping
         the finished product.

           More technically, marble is a limestone that has crystallized due to a geological metamorphism
           over a very long period of time, ranging from 7 to 120 million years. The Marble Institute of
           America assigns group classifications for soundness and working qualities. “D” marble are
           generally more decorative and more expensive than “A” marble.

                 Group A – Sound marbles with uniform, favorable working qualities and suitable for heavy
      traffic.

                 Group B – Similar in character to “A” marble, but working characteristics are somewhat
                 less favorable, occasional natural faults; suitable for most normal traffic – light commercial;
                 residential.

                 Group C – Somewhat less favorable working qualities; geological flaws, voids, veins and
                 lines of separation; suitable for walls and very light traffic areas.

      2. TERRAZZO – Primarily a concrete composition with marble chips mixed in. Composed of 70%
         - 95% marble, it was very popular in the 1930’s – 1950’s. It can be polished as all stones.

      3. AGGLOMERATE MARBLE – This material is sometimes call modern day terrazzo and is
         composed of 90-05% marble. The marble chips are bound with resin; may have a granite-like
         appearance. This material tends to be soft; but reacts with normal maintenance and restoration
         procedures.

      4. TRAVERTINE – Ivory to golden brown colored limestone formed over 600,000 years by
         precipitation in hot, mineral springs. It comes from the ground, relatively “hot” compared to
         marble, but hardens with age and exposure. It has a sponge-like texture with up to ½” holes
         and is much softer than marble.

      5. LIMESTONE – A sedimentary rock; relatively soft, weathers well. Has a tight-grained
         appearance and usually is seen in a honed (unpolished) state. Tends to be much more porous
         and needs special attention. Most limestone can be polished, but the polish is generally not
         durable.

      6. GRANITE – Derived from an Italian word; “granito,” meaning grained. It is very hard,
         crystalline, igneous or metamorphic rock primarily composed of feldspar, quartz and less
         amounts of dark minerals. Mineral grains are visible and are a distinct characteristic of granite.
         Granite can be 10 times harder than marble and is considerable less porous than most marbles;
         more resistant to wear and damage. The surface is difficult to restore.

      7. ONYX– An agate-like stone formed by precipitation in cold mineral springs. It is often
         translucent with a layered appearance. It is not used extensively and caution is to be used
         when working with Onyx.

       8. SLATE – A stone that does not take polish. A fine-grained metamorphic rock derived from
          clays and more often, shales. It has a cleavage that permits it to be readily split into thin,
          smooth sheets. Most popular colors are green and black, but new shades are imported.



SECTION 8 – MATERIALS and USES
A. MATERIALS AND USES to be noted on the diagram (if applicable)

   1. Cement backer board - Used to cover wood subfloors, wood steps and risers and all wet areas;
      eliminates the need for wire mesh and mortar coat.

   2. Cut-tile base - Trim piece cut from the floor tile and used around the perimeter of the walls in
      place of bull nose.

   3. Marble thresholds - A reducer used at doorways; most commonly in bathrooms

   4. Vinyl cap - Trim piece that is used to cover the unglazed edge of a tile. Ideal for the top edge of
      a cut-tile base. It can also be used to make the transition between the ceramic and vinyl or wood.

   5. Bond coat strengthener - Latex additive mixed with the mortar in place of water. It must be
      used when tiling over a non-porous subfloor.

   6. Grout protectant - Latex additive mixed in the grout in place of water. It adds resistance to
      staining and should be used when working with light colored grouts.


B. MATERIALS FOR SETTING CERAMIC TILE (Installation Procedures in Section 14)

   The most widely-used materials for setting ceramic tile each possess qualities for installation under
   certain specifications. The CONVENTIONAL PORTLAND CEMENT MORTAR application, including
   the one-coat method is the only recognized thick-bed application. The other types are thin-bed
   methods.


   1. TYPES

       A. PORTLAND-CEMENT MORTAR
          Mixture of Portland cement and sand, roughly in proportions of 1:5 for floors

           1. Suitable for most surfaces
              A. Mortar bed of up to 2-inches in thickness
                  1. Two methods:
                      a. Set tile on a mortar bed that is still workable
                      b. Set tile on a mortar bed with dry-set or latex/polymer modified Portland-
                      cement mortar

           Dry-set mortars and latex-portland cement mortars can be used in place of a neat cement
           (portland-cement mixed with water to a desired consistency) as a 1/16” thick bond coat to bond
           ceramic tile to a Portland cement mortar bed that is workable. This is also used on a cured
           Portland cement mortar bed (minimum 3/32” thickness after tile is embedded). Absorptive
           ceramic tile must be soaked before setting on a mortar bed that is still workable when using a
           neat Portland cement bond coat. A minimum of 20 hours cure at 70 degrees is adequate, but
           longer mortar bed cures of up to 10 days are preferred.




                                                                                                         26
B. DRY-SET MORTAR

setting tile.

    a. Uses are similar to dry-set mortar
    b. Less rigid than portland cement mortar
    c. If used in an area that may not dry out (pools, showers), it is recommended that the
       completed installation be allowed to dry out thoroughly BEFORE exposure to water (14 to
       over 60 days depending on climate, exterior, interior, etc.)

D. EGP (EXTERIOR GLUE PLYWOOD) LATEX PORTLAND CEMENT MORTAR
   Modified portland cement dry-set mortar to which a polymer is incorporated in latex form to
   bond ceramic tile to exterior glue plywood in interior dry or limited water exposure areas only.

E. EPOXY MORTAR
   Mortar system designed for chemical resistance employing epoxy resin and epoxy hardener
   portions.

       resistance are important considerations.
   b. High temperature resistant formulas are also available.
   c. Acceptable subfloors, when properly prepared include:
       • Concrete
       • Wood and plywood

         economical
             epoxy application
     c. NOT designed for chemical resistance
     d. Recommended for residential floors, over substrates such as glass mesh mortar units and
         concrete
     e. 100% coverage is required where firm support under the tiles is mandatory
     f. Some manufacturers recommend this as a bond coat or setting material and also for
         grouting.

G. FURAN RESIN MORTAR




                                                                                                     27

            c. Furan grouts are also available

    2. ADHESIVES

        A. EPOXY ADHESIVE
            1. Epoxy adhesives are used in place of thin-set mortar materials, but the installation
        methods are the same.
            2. Adhesive system employing epoxy resin and epoxy hardener portions.
            3. Epoxies are usually a two-part system that is to be mixed prior to use. Each has its own
        use.
            4. Formulated for thin-setting of tile on floors, walls and counters.
            5. Designed primarily for high bond strength and ease of application, not for optimum
               chemical resistance, but tends to be better than that of organic adhesives
            6. Spot-bonding epoxy is a multi-component high-strength epoxy adhesive designed for
               spot bonding

        B. ORGANIC ADHESIVES
           1. Interior use only; ready to use with no further addition of liquid or powder, which cures or
              sets by evaporation
           2. Suitable for tile installation on floors, walls and counters where surfaces are properly
              prepared.
           3. Suitable prepared backings for DRY areas include gypsum board, gypsum plaster,
              portland-cement mortar, formed concrete and masonry.
           4. Suitable prepared backings for WET areas include portland-cement mortar, formed
              concrete, masonry.
           5. Adherence to ANSI A136.1 is a minimum criterion for selecting an organic adhesive.
           6. Organic adhesives are not recommended in areas exposed to temperatures exceeding
              140F.

            CONCERNS with organic adhesives
              a. Shrinks as it dries, much more than mortar
              b. Has low compressive strength compared to mortar
              c. Stays moist and fresh inside a bucket and in conditions similar to the inside of a
                 bucket and can lead to bond failures
              d. Because of the issues with drying, they can only be used on tiles no larger than 6x6
                 inches for floors
              e. Not suitable for swimming pools or exteriors
              f. Supply some flexibility to the tile facing
              g. Bond strength varies greatly among numerous brands available
              h. Solvents in some adhesives are irritating to some persons and some are flammable

    3. ADHESIVE APPLICATION
       • Adhesives are applied in one thin layer with a trowel
       • Use the flat edge for continuous coverage
       • Use the notched edge for uniform thickness
       • If leveling or truing is required, an underlayment is used

   4. THIN-SET BED METHOD
        Description
        Thin-set or thin-bed method is the installation of tile with thin-bed bonding materials without using
a mortar bed.




                                                                                                           28
     a. The majority of today’s tile installations are set by using a thin-bed method.
     b. Thin-bed installation is so common that many buildings are no longer designed to
        accommodate the thickness of a mortar-bed installation.
     c. The thin-bed method direct-bond to the concrete floor uses for the first layer, dry-set or latex-
        portland cement mortar bond coat with the ceramic tile as the final layer.
     d. If the floor is made of wood, the direct-bond method is not used.
     e. Wood based panels, such as particle board, composition (veneer) panels, non-veneer panels
        such as CDX, OSB, etc, lauan and softwood plywood are not recommended as backing
        materials for direct bonding of ceramic tile.
     f. Wood-based panels such as particle board, composition (veneer) panels, non-veneer panels
        (CDX, OSB, etc.), lauan and softwood plywood are NOT recommended as backing materials
        for direct bonding of ceramic tiles.
     g. Each thin-set product is specific to meet the special needs of a particular installation.
     h. Thin-sets are not designed to create a mortar bed in an undulating substrate.
     i. Thin-set does not bond to the polymer accent pieces because of a non-porous surface.

       2. Allows independent movement between the two and limits the transfer of stresses

7. GROUT (Grout Installation Procedures in Section 15)
   “A bad grout can ruin a perfect installation.”

    The quality of the grout affects the longevity and the maintenance requirements of the tiled area.
    1. Use the recommended joint sizes stated by the manufacturer.
    2. A common mistake is installing grout in joints that are too large, which causes problems.
    3. Grout shrinkage produces unsightly results, particularly if unsanded grout is used in joint that
    are too large.
    4. The grout’s compressive strength may be too low when used it joints that are too wide.




                                                                                                    30
SECTION 11 – RADIANT-HEATED FLOOR SYSTEMS
Description: Radiant-heating systems involve supplying heat directly to the floor or to panels in the wall or
ceiling

    •   Systems depend largely on radiant heat transfer: the delivery of heat directly from the hot surface
        to the people and objects in the room via the radiation of heat, which is also called infrared radiation.
    •   Radiant heating is the effect you feel when you can feel the warmth of a hot stovetop element from
        across the room.
    •   When radiant heating is located in the floor, it is often called radiant floor heating or simply floor
        heating.

INSTALLATION of TILE OVER RADIANT SYSTEMS
   • The substrate cannot exceed 85 degrees before, during or after installation.
   • Check with the manufacturer of tile and thin-set for installation recommendations before
      installation.
   • The system must be operational a minimum of 2 weeks prior to the tile installation.
   • Special attention is to be addressed concerning radiant systems as many manufacturers of tile
      and thin-sets do not recommend direct-bonding to radiant substrate.

Types of Radiant Floor Heat
   A. ELECTRIC RADIANT FLOORS

        1. Electric radiant floors typically consist of electric cables built into the floor.
        2. Systems that feature mats of electrically conductive plastic are also available, and are mounted
           onto the subfloor below a floor covering such as tile.
        3. Because of the relatively high cost of electricity, electric radiant floors are usually only cost-
           effective if they include a significant thermal mass, such as a thick concrete floor, and your
           electric utility company offers time-of-use rates.
        4. Time-of-use rates allow you to "charge" the concrete floor with heat during off-peak hours
           (approximately 9pm to 6am)
        5. If the floor's thermal mass is large enough, the heat stored in it will keep the house comfortable
           for eight to ten hours, without any further electrical input (particularly when daytime
           temperatures are significantly warmer than nighttime temperatures).
        6. Electric radiant floors may also make sense for additions onto homes for which it would be
           impractical to extend the heating system into the addition.

    B. HYDRONIC RADIANT FLOORS

        1. Hydronic (liquid) systems are the most popular and cost-effective radiant heating systems for
           heating-dominated climates.
        2. Hydronic radiant floor systems pump heated water from a boiler through tubing laid in a pattern
           under floor
        3. In some systems, the temperature in each room is controlled by regulating the flow of hot water
           through each tubing loop.
        4. This is done by a system of zoning valves or pumps and thermostats.
        5. The cost of installing a hydronic radiant floor varies by location and also depends on the size
           of the home, the type of installation, the floor covering, remoteness of the site, and the cost of
           labor.

    C. The R-VALUE

        1. The R-value indicates insulation’s resistance to heat flow.
        2. The higher the R-value; the greater the insulating effectiveness.
        3. It depends on the type of insulation and includes its material, thickness, and density.




                                                                                                              31
      4. When calculating the R-value of a multilayered installation, add the R-values of the individual
          layers.
      5. Installing more insulation in the home increases the R-value and the resistance to heat flow.
      6. Effectiveness of the insulation's resistance to heat flow depends on how and where the
          insulation is installed.
      7. For example, insulation that is compressed will not provide its full rated R-value.
      8. The overall R-value of a wall or ceiling will be somewhat different from the R-value of the
          insulation itself because some heat flows around the insulation through the studs and joists.
      9. It is important to properly install the insulation to achieve the maximum R-value.
      10. The amount of insulation or R-value needed depends on the climate, type of heating and
          cooling system, and the section of the house to be insulated.

SECTION 10 – DEFLECTION – JOIST SPACING
A. DEFLECTION

   Description: Deflection is to bend, flex or bow. Wood expands and contracts when the moisture
   content changes. Wood substrates deflect under loads more than concrete substrates.

        1. A substrate must be rigid enough that the floor will not deflect for ceramic tile installations.
        2. The amount of deflection in a floor must be minimized to prevent failures where the most
           bending occurs. This is between the floor joists and over the joists.

        3. Too much deflection causes cracked and powdered-out grout joints followed by the
           appearance of unsightly tiles.

        4. If the subfloor is made of wood panels fastened to joists, the greatest amount of subfloor
           deflection occurs in the subfloor panels at the midpoint between joists under concentrated
           loads.

        5. Too much deflection at this point causes cracked and powdered grout joints, followed by
           cracked and debonded tiles over time.

B. JOIST SPACING

        1. Most installation methods limit joist spacing to 16” on center.
        2. All methods require the subfloor to be at least 19/32” thick, or 5/8”.
        3. Others require a thickness of ¾-inch.
        4. A spacing of 1/8-inch is recommended at all end and edge joints on all sides to provide room
             for the wood to expand. If ignored, this can cause tiles above butted panels to crack or
             debond (loosen).




                                                                                                          32
SECTION 11 – TILE INSTALLATION PROCEDURES

   2. Address potential concerns
   3. Prepare the area to receive the mortar bed, CBU, etc.
   4. Lay out the area and establish gridlines
   5. Install tile using appropriate adhesive
   6. Check that the proper bond is achieved

    5. Tile set with modified epoxy emulsion mortar
    6. Tile set and grouted with water cleanable, chemical resistant tile setting epoxy mortar



D. TYPES of INSTALLATION

    1. THIN-SET / THIN-BED METHOD

        a. Thin-bed installation is so common that many buildings are no longer designed to
           accommodate the thickness of a mortar-bed installation.
        b. The thin-bed method direct-bond to the concrete floor uses for the first layer, dry-set or latex-
           portland cement mortar bond coat with the ceramic tile as the final layer.
        c. If the floor is made of wood, the direct-bond method is not used. Wood based panels, such
           as particle board, composition (veneer) panels, non-veneer panels such as CDX, OSB, etc,
           lauan and softwood plywood are NOT recommended as backing materials for direct bonding
           of ceramic tile.

    2. THE MORTAR BED
       To install tile using the wire reinforced mortar bed method, follow these steps:

        a. Inspect the area to receive tile
        b. If it is a floor, the wood subfloor must be properly fastened with the nail pattern 8-inches in
           field and        perimeter.
        c. Staple a layer of 15-pound roofing felt to the wood subfloor
        d. Reinforce the wire, either a 2.5 gauge expanded metal lathe or 2” x 2” welded wire mesh and
           lay it over the felt, but not attached to the subfloor. It is supported so when the mortar is
           installed, the wire will be in the center of the mortar.




                                                                                                          33
         e. Establish the screed line by placing float sticks in a row of mortar and leveling it so the floor is
            either flat or sloping toward a drain.
         f. Place the cement mortar and tap into place. Using a straightedge, rod off any excess mortar
         g. After the mortar has reached its initial set, rub the surface with a wood or resin float to
            remove any high spots.
         h. Fill the low spots from rodding it with the straightedge. This also tightens up the mortar to
            provide a solid surface to set tile.

         After the mortar bed has cured
         i. Determine the starting point for the layout. Layout the gridlines
         j. Mix the thin-set mortar according to the manufacturer’s specifications
         k. Begin spreading the thin-set on the mortar bed using the flat side of the notched trowel to
             achieve an even coat of material
         l. Use the notched side of the trowel to comb the material to achieve a consistent thickness of
             material
         m. Place the tile into the thin-set, using a twisting motion to achieve full contact with the tile
         n. Straighten the tiles using a straightedge or spacers to keep the tile square and straight to the
             grid lines
         o. Clean off any excess thin-set from between the tiles and from the surface of the tiles.

   3. PLASTIC (WET) MORTAR BED
        This method requires more skill on the part of the installer. The steps are the same with the
exception:
        a. The mortar bed is not cured first
        b. The tile is set into the wet mortar using a bond coat of portland cement applied to the mortar
        c. Press the tile into the mortar
        d. All other steps remain the same

    4. DRY-SET PORTLAND CEMENT MORTAR
       This method is used for setting tile over prepared concrete, masonry, glass mesh mortar units or
       cement backer units or other cementitious underlayments.

         Preparation for the Dry-Set Portland Cement Mortar

         a. Inspect these surfaces to make sure they are clean, dry and free or any sealers
         b. If installing tile directly over concrete, find your layout and draw grid lines
         c. If installing over cement mortar units and you are installing the cement mortar units, install
            them first.
         d. Fasten the backer board according to the manufacturer’s installation instructions.
         e. Draw the starting lines and grid lines after determining the cuts at the perimeter are at ½ tile
            or greater
         f. Mix the thin-set according to the instructions.
         g. Key in an even coat of thin-set with the flat side of the trowel
         h. Comb with the notched side of the trowel to achieve an even consistency
         i. Place the tile into the thin-set with a back and forth motion to securely bond the tile
         j. Wipe off any excess material from the grout joints and the surface of the tile
         k. Straighten the tiles with a straightedge or with spacers to the grid lines.

E. CHECKING FOR PROPER BOND
   It is important to check the proper bond. This is done by:

    1.   Periodically lifting a tile after setting it into the adhesive.
    2.   Inspect the back of the tile for complete coverage with setting material
    3.   If it is not completely covered, apply more adhesive or back butter the tiles
    4.   Check that the correct notch trowel is used
    5.   Dry areas require 80% coverage on the back of tile.




                                                                                                             34
    6. Wet areas require 95% coverage on the back of tile.
    7. A minimum of 3/32” to 1/8” thin-set is required under the tile after setting.

F. BACK BUTTERING
   This is done when the back of the tile has large lugs or grooves.
   1. Apply adhesive directly to the tile with a margin trowel
   2. Cover the entire surface to achieve the proper bond

    After the thin-set has cured

    1.  The tile is ready to grout
    2.  Using masking tape, cover any adjacent material before grouting
    3.  Mix the grout to manufacturer specifications.
    4.  Use a rubber grout float to move the grout in a direction diagonal to the grout joints
    5.  Hold the grout float at a 45-degree angle to the tile
    6.  After forcing grout into the joints, float at a 90-degree angle to the tile
    7.  Pull across the tile in a diagonal direction to remove excess grout from the surface of the tile
    8.  Use a damp sponge to wipe the tile diagonally in one direction once with each side of the sponge
    9.  After the grout has set up, a film is visible on the surface. Remove with cheesecloth, using a
        polishing action.
    10. Remove the masking tape from adjacent areas to complete the installation.



SECTION 14 – GROUTING THE TILE
A. MIXING: Proper mixing is extremely important!
   1. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for the amount of liquid to use.
   2. Water should be clean and cool.
   3. Before mixing the powder with water or a polymer additive, dry-blend the bag of powder for a
      consistent blend of all components.
   4. Create a stiff working consistency that must be scooped out of the bucket with a trowel or a float.
   5. Follow the recommended mixing speed and time. Usually, lower speeds are specified because
      mixing too fast or too long produces weaker grout if air is trapped.

    PROBLEMS OCCUR when the grout is mixed with too much liquid or when liquid is added to the grout
    during the grouting process to keep the material workable.

B. SPREADING THE GROUT
   1. Shading variations occur when the grout joints vary in width or depth.
   2. Remove all mortar before grouting.
   3. Wipe the surface with a damp sponge immediately before grouting using very little water.
   4. Firmly pack grout into clean joints. Good compaction produces dense grout that is stronger and
      more stain-resistant.
   5. DO NOT pack grout into movement joints.
   6. Remove as much excess grout as possible to minimize the amount of water that is necessary for
      washing and tooling the joints later.
   7. If the grout becomes too stiff, remix it by hand, but DO NOT add water.

C. ROUGH WASHING
   1. Grout must be firm in joints before beginning to rough wash.
   2. Press on the grout; if ready the surface will be dry enough not to dent. Usually, it becomes a
      lighter color.
   3. It can take between 5 and 45-minutes before grout is ready to wash




                                                                                                       35
36
    4. Factors that impact this
       a. High temperatures and low humidity cause faster drying
       b. porous tiles absorb moisture and cause faster drying
       c. smaller grout joint dry faster
       d. Stiffer, drier grout dries faster
    5. Wash the tiles with a minimum amount of water and tool the joints and wring the sponge out
       thoroughly
    6. Minimizing water will:
       a. Make the grout stronger, denser and more stain and abuse resistant
       b. Grout remains firmer during the washing process to avoid low grout joints
       c. Grout color is more consistent
       d. Installation is completed sooner if the grout stays fairly dry during the process
    7. Sculpt joints into crisp, uniform, smooth grout lines
    8. Leaving the joints too high results in an unsightly appearance, but do not wash too low.

D. FINAL WASH
   1. Allow the grout film to dry to a haze.
   2. Use firm, steady pressure to wipe off the haze with a thoroughly wrong out sponge rinsed with
      clean water
   3. Make only one pass with each side of the sponge before rinsing it clean
   4. Continually wring and wash out the sponge
   5. Stay on the job until the final wash water has dried and there is no longer a visible film on the
      surface of the tile.
   6. Once the grout has hardened somewhat, cut the grout off in a clean line if it has entered a
      movement joint that will be visible in the finished installation.

E. CURING and PROTECTION
   1. Restrict traffic in freshly grouted areas – NO heavy traffic for at least 24 - 72 hours.
   2. Avoid water exposure and freezing temperatures.
   3. Allow extended cure times when temperatures are below 60-degrees and/or relative humidity is
      above 70%.
   4. “Cover curing” or “damp curing” cementitious grout produces stronger grout and darker shading.
   5. To damp cure new grout, mist the completed installation with cool, clean water.
   6. Cover with protective paper that is free of dyes.
   7. Grout improvements make damp curing virtually unnecessary, but this procedure enhances
      performance.

F. CAULKING
   1. Fill visible movement joints with a compressible material, not grout.
   2. A “flexible sealant,” such as 100% silicone or urethane, is to be used in place of latex or acrylic
       caulks.
   3. Caulks are worn down by exposure to chemicals, cleaners, moisture, traffic, temperature
       changes, sunlight and movement.
   4. Flexible sealants must bond to the edges of tile, but not the substrate.
   5. For joints that do extend below tile, such as a saw-cut control joint in concrete, insert a foam
       backer rod into the joint before filling it with sealant.
   6. Install bond breaker tape in joints that do not extend below the tile before filling with sealant.
   7. With tape and a bond breaker in place, fill the joint if the edges are clean and dry.
   8. In a few minutes, remove excess sealant and form the joint with a forming tool.
   9. After forming the joint, quickly remove the tape and touch-up any imperfections before the sealer
       has set.
   10. Protect the sealant from traffic for at least 24-hours.
   11. In place of filling the joints with sealant, pre-made movement joints in the form of strips are
       installed during the tile installation.
   12. Apply mortar under and over these prefabricated strips or the tiles may crack.
