locking mechanism with models available that lock into the floor, both floor and head

• One and Two Point Locking Options Available
   We have expanded our Center Lock line by adding a new series of 4" x 10" Center Locks
and Center Lock Glass Keepers that allow you to secure your 'all-glass' doors easier than ever
before.
   This innovative new series allows for one point and two point locking of 'all-glass' doors.
Unlike previous two point locking applications that force you to reach for the bottom rail of the
door, our system allows you to operate the lock at a comfortable 36" to 42" (914 to 1067 mm)
above the floor. No more bending or kneeling. Simply turn the key or thumbturn found on the
Center Lock and your door is locked into the floor (one point), or locked into the floor and jamb
or Glass Mounted Keeper (two points).
   For additional information or assistance in choosing the right Center Lock for your application,
contact CRL Technical Sales at (800) 421-6144 in the U.S., (877) 421-6144 from Canada,
or (323) 588-1281 International, and ask for Ext. 7700. You can also send e-mail from the                                     CRL Two Point Center Lock with Optional DEK4102

inside, and a Keyed Cylinder on the outside. 'No handle' option available on special order.

only. Retrofit applications are not recommended because the bottom door rail must be
factory-modified to accept the Extension Rod Throw, and the door glass requires a specially

Sales for ordering assistance. NOTE: In applications where A.D.A. Codes are a concern,
a 10" (254 mm) tall bottom rail should be used with this Center Lock.

   CRL Push Button Lock and Glass Keeper assemblies require no electrical connections so the
mounting is exactly the same as our other 6" x 10" Center Locks. On the exterior side of the door is a
Keypad with five vertical push buttons, numbered in sequential order from top to bottom. On the interior
side there is a lever, which operates the Latchbolt at all times.
   The lock complies with A.D.A. standards and is ideal for high frequency use in hospitals, entrances
to commercial and industrial buildings, apartments, condominiums, schools, etc.
   The Center Lock Glass Keeper (sold separately) is specially machined to accept the strike from the
Push Button Lock. If a Center Lock Glass Keeper is not required a Strike Plate for the jamb is supplied
with the Push Button Lock assembly.

   CRL manufactures a complete line of Panic Handles designed with the 'all-glass' door in mind.
These elegant tubular devices give you maximum viewing area and a contemporary look when
used on 1/2" or 3/4" (12 or 19 mm) tempered glass doors. The most popular of these Panics is
our PA100 Series. They provide a solution to the strict Americans With Disabilities Act (A.D.A.)
Codes that confront every manufacturer and installer of 'all-glass' doors. The interior portion of
the device is a slender 1-1/4" (32 mm) tube stretching across the door and then gently turning upwards to the top of the door, eliminating any
interference at the lower half of the door, which must remain clear of obstructions to pass A.D.A. demands. The operating mechanism is
completely concealed within the tube, and retracts a roller latch bolt at the top of the door when pushed gently. Complementing the sleek
interior look, we offer a large selection of exterior pull handles that can be as simple as a horizontal handle (Model PA100A) to one that mirrors
the interior device (Model PA100D).All PA100 Series Panic Handles come with a 'dogging' feature that allows you to lock the device in the open
position by simply sliding a lever, giving free access during business hours. They also can be used in conjunction with an Electric Strike,
allowing for remote keyless entry. For your convenience, Custom Headers are available with all strike hardware installed.
   When A.D.A. Codes are not a concern, we also offer our PA110 Series Panic Handles. These Panics are of the same sleek design as the
PA100 Series, except they stretch across the door and then bend downward to the bottom of the door, latching at the floor or threshold. They
operate just like the PA100 Series Panics, and have the same 'dogging' feature. Strikes are available for either threshold or no threshold
applications providing secure, accurate latching every time.
     All of our PA100 and PA110 Panic Handles go through rigorous testing before they leave our manufacturing facility, ensuring that a high
quality, dependable Panic will serve your customer for years to come. Most importantly, they are all UL305, ULC/5132-93, and ANSI/BHMA
A156.3-2001, Grade 1 Certified. For more information on Panic Handles, please visit our web site at crlaurence.com.

   CRL manufactures a complete line of Deadbolt Handles designed to offer easily accessible locking
hardware for 'all-glass' doors in an elegant tubular device, while maximizing your viewing area. Our
Deadbolt Handles add a contemporary look to any 1/2" or 3/4" (12 or 19 mm) tempered glass door.
   The interior portion of the device is a slender 1-1/4" (32 mm) tube. The locking hardware is
completely concealed within the tube. The top deadbolt retracts with just a simple turn of a key or
thumbturn conveniently located at a comfortable height above the finished floor. To complement the
sleek interior look, we offer a variety of exterior pull handles that can be as simple as a horizontal
handle or one that mirrors the interior device.
   All top locking Deadbolt Handles can be used in conjunction with an Electric Strike, allowing for
remote keyless entry. For your convenience, Custom Headers are available with all strike hardware
installed.
   Where A.D.A. Codes are not a concern, we offer our bottom locking Deadbolt Handles. These
Deadbolts are of the same sleek design as the top locking Deadbolt Handles, except they Latch at the
bottom of the door into the floor or threshold. Strikes are available for either threshold or no threshold
applications, providing secure, accurate engagement of the deadbolt with every closing.
   All of our Deadbolt Handles go through rigorous testing before they leave our manufacturing facility,
ensuring that a high quality, dependable Deadbolt Handle is installed every time. Most importantly, they
are all UL Classified to ANSI A156.16-1997 Standard. For more information on Deadbolt Handles,

   CRL EG100 Series Electronic Egress Control Handles are an economical method to
control access into, and safe exit from, areas that call for security and still maintain the
beauty and view of an 'all-glass' door. These elegant tubular devices give you maximum
viewing area and \\a contemporary look when used on 1/2" or 3/4" (12 or 19 mm)
tempered glass doors. Like our Panic and Deadbolt Handle Line, these Handles also
meet the rigid requirements imposed by the A.D.A. Codes on every manufacturer and                                            CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY & FIRE

This eliminates any interference in the lower half of the door, which must remain clear of                                                 LISTING PROGRAM

   An Electronic Switch is completely concealed within the tube and releases a Magnetic Lock at the top or bottom of the door when gently
pushed. To complement the sleek interior look, we offer a variety of exterior pull handles that can be as simple as a horizontal handle (Model
EG100A) to one that mirrors the interior device (Model EG100D). A Magnetic Lock must be ordered separately. Please contact CRL Technical
Sales. For your convenience, Custom Headers are available with all lock hardware installed.
   If A.D.A. Codes are not a concern, we also have our EG110 Series Electronic Egress Control Handles. These Handles are of the same sleek
design and operation as the EG100 Series, except they stretch across the door and then bend downward to the bottom of the door. All of our
EG100 and EG110 Electronic Egress Control Handles come equipped with surge suppression ZNR that is compatible with most Shear Locks.
However, we suggest that the lock manufacturer be contacted to ensure compatibility with this feature. All CRL Electronic Egress Control
Handles go through rigorous testing before they leave our manufacturing facility, ensuring that a high quality, dependable product is installed
every time. Most importantly, they are all UL and ULC Recognized Components, tested to NFPA Life and Safety Code Standards. For more
