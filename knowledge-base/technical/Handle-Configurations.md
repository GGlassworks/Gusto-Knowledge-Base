                                          knowledge to activate the lock. The simple

                                          gloves or clothing) activates an electronic
                                          sensor which immediately releases the lock.

                                          Optionally, an exterior keyed access device can
                                          be installed to allow entry. A dogging feature
                                          defeats locking action during business hours.
                                          Electronic strikes are available for use with our

                                          that does not require any special tools or
                                          knowledge to activate the lock. The simple
                                          act of touching the bar/handle (even through
                                          gloves or clothing) activates an electronic
                                          sensor which immediately releases the lock.
