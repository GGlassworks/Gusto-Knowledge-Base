Introduction



The all-glass entrance has become increasingly popular with architects and interior designers. These entrance systems
are technically not all glass but would be better described as heavy glass door and entrance systems. For the purpose
of this Design Manual, heavy glass (HG) is defined as fully tempered glass equal to or greater than 3/8 in. (10 mm), or
tempered laminated glass constructed with two or more lites of glass equal to or greater than 1/2 in. (12 mm). Entrance
systems incorporate HG, metal rails, small metal patch fittings and sometimes structural silicone. Heavy glass with
polished edges provides sleek-looking entrance doors that make an elegant statement for the building or shop owner.

This Heavy Glass Door Design Manual is provided to assist designers in making their decisions by supplying answers
to the most commonly asked design questions. A HG entrance can be used as an exterior entrance for a monumental
building or a simple interior mall storefront. The attractiveness of a storefront or entrance tends to be the focal point for
pedestrians and thus sets the stage for the building or shop.

The purpose of this Design Manual is to provide authoritative technical information to designers and to offer some
suggestions as to the proper applications of HG used in doors and entrances. The aim of this Design Manual is to promote
good design practice and adherence to appropriate structural standards in fully tempered heavy glass storefront and
entrance design. Good design and adherence to standards will serve as a benefit to all parties involved: the architect, the
glass fabricator, the installing contractor and, most importantly, the building owner, who is the end user.

This manual hopes to offer assistance during the decision-making stages of a project. The contents of this manual are for
the design professional’s use in review and final approval.

I. General Information


When designing storefront or entrance systems, the requirements for accommodation of traffic, plus the effects of
wind, rain, and cold or hot weather should be considered. Severely cold climate areas usually require vestibules with
both exterior and interior doors. Heavy glass doors are not typically weather-tight, so they are most frequently used
as the interior vestibule doors, shop-front entrances in interior shopping malls, and interior office applications. Where
ADA or barrier-free access for the physically handicapped is required, design information to assist the architect has
been included in this reference manual to the extent that it has been defined by the International Building Code (IBC).
Heavy glass doors have some unique characteristics which help accommodate persons in wheelchairs.

The entrances to a building or business give one of the first and last impressions of the building to the pedestrian
traffic entering and exiting. The configuration of the entrance doors relative to surrounding conditions is a vital
factor. The flow of traffic from the sidewalk, mall corridor or parking area will determine the number of entrances
required. Doors must be located so as not to swing into the path of pedestrian traffic. All heavy glass doors, since
they are manufactured using fully tempered glass, are intended to meet the safety glazing requirements of ANSI
Z97.1 unlimited class and CPSC 16 CFR 1201 Category II. Correct selection of push-pull and operating hardware is an
essential element in safe design. Door swing arcs should be limited by the closer hardware or doorstops to prevent one
door from swinging into the path of another door. Reference Glass Technical Paper Guidelines for the Production of
Heat-Treated Glass for more detail.

Where pairs of doors are required, six-foot-wide openings with a pair of three-foot-wide doors are recommended, as
narrower openings tend to impede the flow of pedestrian traffic. Design sidelites so they will not be mistaken for clear
openings that invite pedestrian traffic to walk into the glass. Visual patterns, decorative railings or plantings will help
prevent this type of problem. If the entrance doors are recessed from the face of the building, it will prevent the door
from swinging into pedestrian traffic and also protect exterior doors from cross winds.

Design Considerations
Applications requiring structural analysis should be provided by qualified individuals or companies with engineering
capabilities. For glass entrances containing butt-glazed glass panels, the height of the opening (and not the width)
will determine the glass thickness required. Butt-joint glazing should not be confused with structural silicone glazing.
Both have the same exterior appearance, but structural silicone glazing has interior vertical mullions to which the
glass is adhered with structural silicone sealant. Individual glass lites attached to the structure at the top and bottom
only (head and sill) are considered typical butt-joint glazing. If, in addition to the top and bottom support, one vertical
edge is structurally supported, the glass is supported on three sides. If all four edges are structurally supported, the
lite has four-sided support. Butt-jointing one glass panel to another glass panel when both are in the same plane
does not structurally support the glass. It is accepted industry standard that structural mullions must be of sufficient
strength so as not to deflect when fully loaded more than the span divided by 175, in order for that edge of the glass to
be considered fully supported. Typically, the deflection of the glass should be limited as per Table 1 in Appendix I or as
otherwise prescribed in local building codes and/or specifications. Tempering does not reduce glass deflection. Glass
deflection may also be reduced by using thicker glass construction or adding structural mullions.

Varying levels of security can be achieved using standard rail and patch locks, as well as more sophisticated systems
that include electric bolt, shear/magnetic locks and panic devices. Traffic volumes, floor slab thickness, egress
requirements and ADA considerations will determine closing device location and selection. Several glass door types
can be adapted to automatic and power assisted operators to meet ADA requirements.

Heavy glass doors and entrances can be installed in seismic regions. The design professional must specify the various
loads anticipated during a seismic event. Because heavy glass is often butt-glazed, the joint width between panels
should be designed to avoid glass-to-glass contact due to the anticipated sway of the building or opening frame. The
perimeter glazing channel should also be designed to provide sufficient edge clearance to avoid glass-to-frame contact

due to building sway. See “Glazing Considerations for Systems in Seismic Regions” in the GANA Glazing Manual 50th
Anniversary Edition for additional considerations.

Interior Applications
Heavy glass doors are becoming increasingly popular for interior applications. Although wind load is not a
consideration, other types of structural loading may limit the size of interior doors. Interior fully tempered
glass sidelite panels are not always sealed. See Appendix I of this manual (reprint of Section 9 of the NGA with
GANA Engineering Standards Manual, 2019 edition) for additional information regarding height and thickness
recommendations for fully tempered interior butt-glazed glass panels. Traffic volume for interior applications needs
to be considered the same as with exterior applications. Interior doors are often locked in both the open and closed
position, eliminating the need for closers. Structural design of fully tempered all-glass interior entrance systems is
discussed in detail in Section XIV.

Door Size Limitations
Door sizes need to be limited due to glass flexibility and hardware limitations. Closers and pivots have weight
limitations. Doors that are too wide are difficult to control in windy conditions and may exceed hardware limits. Larger
doors may be used when locked open or infrequently used. Full rails, top and bottom, are recommended for larger
door sizes. See Section XIV Structural Design of Interior Glass Entrance Systems.

IV. Types of Glass


Fully tempered glass or fully tempered laminated heavy glass doors and entrances consist of clear and tinted
substrates; monolithic fully tempered float glass complies with the standards defined in ASTM C1036 and C1048.
Typically, a clear substrate is used and ranges in thickness from 3/8 in. (10 mm); 1/2 in. (12 mm); 5/8 in. (16 mm); and 3/4 in.
(19 mm). Low-iron, tinted and obscure heavy float glass products are also available for these same applications.

Fully tempered laminated glass doors must be a minimum of 1/2 in. (12 mm) thick. See ASTM C1036 and ASTM C1072 for
laminated glass fabrication guidelines.

When using mechanically applied hardware in conjunction with glass with irregular surfaces (i.e. cast, etched and
patterned glass), you must confirm with the hardware manufacturer that you are not reducing the hardware’s ability to
perform properly.

All exposed edges of the glass are ground and polished prior to tempering the glass. Holes for handles and patch
fittings must be drilled in the glass prior to tempering. The diameter of these holes must be slightly larger than the
thickness of the glass. See ASTM C1048 for glass fabrication guidelines.

Based on results from collaborative cyclical testing performed at ambient temperatures on patch fittings with
laminated doors, patch fittings can be used with laminated glass in interior applications where temperatures are
typically maintained around 75⁰F. Note that testing was performed on panels with 0.060 in. standard PVB, structural
PVB, and ionomer. Interlayers are polymers which respond differently at various temperatures; consult the interlayer
manufacturer for details. Prior to specifying other laminate overall thickness or interlayer material for use in these
applications, consult the hardware manufacturer for approval.

VI. Swinging Door Systems


Heavy glass doors are frequently used as swing doors in singles or pairs with door closers or top and bottom pivots. A
free-swinging heavy glass door is attached in the opening, usually at pivot points at both top and bottom of the door.
When a swing door is opened it rotates inward or outward on the pivot axis and moves in an arc out of the plane of the
door opening, permitting access through the opening.

DOOR CLOSERS
The function of a door closer is to control a door during its opening and closing cycle. The closer may be installed
overhead or floor-mounted and is typically concealed, though other options may be available. Varying spring sizes
are available to increase or decrease opening and closing forces. Other optional features may control the hold open
position, delayed egress, positive stops, or electric integration with fire or security systems. Heavy glass doors can
be particularly demanding for closers. It is critical that the closer be properly sized to support the weight of the glass
door and interact properly with the specific hardware used on this type of installation. Many companies manufacture
closers that comply with ADA closing force requirements for both interior and exterior applications. Consult the
manufacturer for proper ADA size compliance and specifics to the application.

Concealed Overhead Closers (C.O.C.s) are typically housed in a header tube above the door. C.O.C.s are used for
light to medium size and weight doors and are used with bottom pivots. The bottom pivots may be adjustable to
accommodate various floor clearances. Examples of C.O.C.s are shown in Figure 5.




                                                        Figure 5

  Rail Door                      Patch Door

Floor Closers are housed in a “cement case” that is permanently grouted into or set in the floor prior to a floor being
poured. Different sizes can accommodate all types of doors, from high traffic to those seldom used. Floor closers can
typically handle heavier and wider doors than can a Concealed Overhead Closer but may not be suitable due to floor
condition limitations such as slab thickness. Floor closers are used in conjunction with top pivots, either walking beam
or surface-applied top pivots. See Figure 6 on the next page.

Other types of door closers utilized include: 1) automatic; 2) power-assisted; 3) surface-mounted; 4) in-rail concealed;
and 5) hinge-mounted.

Auxiliary Closing Methods utilized may include rail-mounted or hinge-mounted, where the closing mechanism is part
of the actual hardware. Consult suppliers for specific limitations.

FREE-SWINGING PIVOT DOORS
Doors can also be installed without a closer using top and bottom pivots or wall-mount hinges. Due to typical size
and weight of heavy glass doors, door control should be addressed. Options may include stops, floor locks, passage
locks and control arms. Doors can be hung on offset pivots when they are required to swing open past 105 degrees.
Offset pivots allow up to a 180-degree swing. See Figure 8 below. The function of pivots is to support the door and
provide swinging action. Pivots fall into two general categories: a) Center hung and b) Offset (see Figures 7 and 8,
respectively). Center hung doors may be single or double acting. Offset pivots are single acting and can allow the use
of compressible bulb weatherstripping for a glass door.

Note:    Pivot locations shown are standard. Other options may be available for specialized applications.

VII. Sliding Doors, Walls and Fronts


Heavy glass doors can be utilized in sliding door systems using either top rollers or floor loaded rollers. When a sliding
door is opened it is moved parallel to and in the same plane as the opening. The weight of the sliding doors can be
suspended from rollers in an overhead track or supported by rollers on a floor track. Generally, door panels in sliding
door systems may be wider than swing doors. Consult the manufacturer for size limits. Sliding doors can be operated
manually or by automated mechanisms.

TOP-HUNG SLIDING SYSTEMS
When the weight of a sliding door is supported by an overhead track it is often referred to as “top-hung.” Top-hung
sliding systems are more versatile than floor-mounted systems. Top-hung sliding panels are easier to maintain because
the operating hardware is located away from traffic areas. Top-hung track must be level and securely anchored to an
adequate overhead structure capable of handling the weight of the system.

Top-Hung Bi-Parting Systems - The configurations available for top-hung bi-parting sliding doors are the same as the
floor-mounted systems shown in the next section. A bottom guide may be required to prevent the doors from swinging
out of plumb. This guide may be concealed by an adjacent fixed sidelite base or be exposed on the floor. Consult the
individual manufacturers for their systems’ capacity for proper design. Refer to Figure 9.

                                                                    A

                                             Heavy Glass Door Design Manual




Stacking Top-Hung Systems - These systems allow the sliding panels to close in a single plane. The sliding panels
can be stacked in a remote “parking” area either parallel or perpendicular to the opening as shown in Figures 10a and
10b below. Special care must be taken to ensure that the structure above the “parking unit” is reinforced to carry the
combined weight of the sliding panels when they are stacked. Because the slider and the fixed sidelite are not on the
same plane, acoustical and security issues need to be addressed.

An optional fixed swing door may be added to permit egress once the wall is fully extended. Depending on the system
specified, one or more of the sliding panels may be converted to a door that can both slide and swing.

                                                                     A

Top-Hung Bi-Fold systems - These systems use offset-type hinges to attach the panels together to form a
perpendicular stack. See Figure 11 below. Roller Hardware for top-hung bi-fold sliding systems may use full rail or
patch fitting to secure the glass to the roller mechanism.

FLOOR-MOUNTED SYSTEMS
Floor-mounted systems use rollers mounted into the bottom door rail and roll on a floor track. This type of sliding door
operates on single or multiple parallel tracks, commonly used in double track or bi-parting configuration. See Figure
12, next page. Because the slider and the fixed sidelite are not on the same plane, acoustical and security issues need
to be addressed.

Multi-slide floor-mounted sliding doors can be used for wide openings by installing several parallel tracks. See Figure
13, next page.

VIII. Entrance Components


LOCKS

Mechanical Latching
Mechanical latching heavy glass doors can be secured using a floor lock, center lock or head lock with standard
keyed cylinders and/or thumbturns. Head and floor locks can be mounted into the door rail or patch lock fitting or
incorporated into the handle. Mechanical locks typically engage at the sill into a strike plate or threshold. If a round
throw bolt is used, a covered “dust-proof” strike may be used to prevent dirt accumulation in the strike area.

Center locks are used when it is desirable to locate a lock mechanism in proximity to the handle height on the door.
This is accomplished by adding a center lock housing which accommodates various lock types. A strike plate is then
mounted to the jamb or a strike housing is mounted to the adjacent sidelite to receive the bolt. Center lock housings
can have various functions: office style locks, passage style locks, storeroom style locks and classroom style locks.

Electrical Latching
There are a variety of electrical latching options including magnetic locks (exposed surface-mounted locks or
concealed shear locks), or electric strikes that work in conjunction with mechanical locks. Any external components
that interface with the door locking system should be reviewed for compatibility, such as card readers, transformers,
power supply, exit buttons, motion sensors, etc.

Locking Ladder Pulls
Locking pulls or deadbolt handles can also be used to combine the function of the pull handle with a deadbolt
locking mechanism. Using the sleek design of a typical ladder-type pull allows the operating function of standard
cylinder/thumb turn to be at a convenient height. These locking pulls can be either the full or partial height of the
door; locking up into the header to comply with ADA handicap codes or down into a floor strike.

PANIC HANDLES/ELECTRONIC EGRESS HANDLES/PADDLES
Exit devices can be installed on all heavy glass doors engaging in top, bottom and/or jamb conditions. There are three
basic types of handles which vary vastly in type and function. Panic handles utilize a positive latching mechanism
that mounts into strike housing or engages into an electric strike mechanism. Mechanical/positive latching devices,
such as panic handles, create secure entries and allow exit when the power is off. Electronic egress handles (see
Electrical Latching above) allow passage by de-energizing and then re-energizing a magnet to create secure entryways.
Electronic egress handles do not mechanically latch. A battery backup system is typically implemented to prevent an
un-secure application in the event of a power failure. Additional accessories such as card readers, motion detectors,
exit buttons, time delays, etc. are often used. Finally, center-lock housing panels with paddle or lever handles can
be used to exit a facility but must not be used in areas designated as emergency exits. See below for more detailed
definitions of Fail-Secure and Fail-Safe Electric Strikes.

Fail-Secure Electric Strikes
Also known as Non-Fail-Safe or Fail-Locked

On entry - Fail-Secure electric strikes MUST BE energized to allow entry.

Electric current is supplied to the electric strike via a signal from an electronic device. When this device energizes the
electric strike it then allows the keeper to move freely; with the keeper released, the latch bolt can be pulled through
the keeper, allowing entry. During electrical outages, however, fail-secure electric strikes will remain locked for a more
secure application. Panic hardware using fail-secure electronic controlled devices will require a battery back-up and/or a
manual keyed exterior cylinder to allow entry during power outages.

Note: Free egress is available at all times via the use of panic hardware.




                                                             18
                                              Heavy Glass Door Design Manual




Fail-Safe Electric Strikes
Also known as Fail-Open or Fail-Unlocked

On entry - Fail-Safe electric strikes MUST BE de-energized to allow entry.

Electric current is turned off to the electric strike, typically via a signal from a card reader. When this device is de-
energized, the electric strike allows the keeper to move freely; with the keeper released the latch bolt can be pulled
through the keeper, allowing entry. During electrical outages the door will remain unlocked unless a battery back-up
supply continuously energizes the electric strike. This type of strike should not be specified for secure applications. Card
readers or exterior keyed cylinders are the only means of entry from the exterior while the lock is energized.

Note: Free egress is available at all times via the use of panic hardware.

When using any type of panic, electronic egress and/or paddle device, always refer to your local, state and federal
building codes to ensure the proper exit device is implemented.

HANDLES
A variety of shapes and styles of handles may be used on heavy glass doors. The most common are 1 in. (25mm)
diameter metal pull handles, attached through holes in the glass. These pull handles can be vertical or horizontal,
straight or offset. Handles are available to match the metal finish on the door or they can be made of wood, plastic or a
contrasting metal finish.

These handles are typically made by “finish hardware” manufacturers and can be supplied either by the glass door
manufacturer or by the finish hardware supplier. Holes for the handles must be drilled in the glass prior to tempering.
Because of the hole pattern or size, not all handles can be mounted to heavy glass. Designers should consult with
the glass door manufacturer or hardware supplier as to the suitability of a particular handle for mounting onto heavy
glass. See Figures 14 and 15 below for commonly used heavy glass door pull handle configurations.

IX. Metal Finishes


Metal door rails and patch fittings for heavy glass doors are typically made from extruded or cast aluminum. Door rails
are available in anodized finishes. They are also available clad with thin gauge sheet metal adhered to an aluminum
extrusion to provide the finishes listed below in Table 1. Small profile patch fittings, shown in Figure 4, usually have
applied covers to conceal the patch bolts and to provide the desired metal finish. Metal finish selection may affect the
maintenance requirements (see Section XVII – Protection and Cleaning).

X. Sidelites with Rails


Sidelites and other fixed glass may have rails, at the top and bottom, or bottom only, to match the doors. To maintain
even alignment with the rail of the adjacent door, a track/saddle of various heights is installed under the sidelite rail,
so the top of the door rail and the top of the sidelite rail are the same height. The track/saddle must be anchored to the
structure at the ceiling and floor. Additional anchoring of the rail to this track may also be required.

Sidelites with rails are available in two types: Pre-Applied Rails (individual panel only) and Field Glazed Rails
(individual or multiple panels). Reference manufacturer’s recommendations for anchoring sidelite rails.

            Entrances utilizing non-structural interlayers and/or exterior door applications are dependent on numerous factors
          impacting the intended design of the entrance. These types of entrances should be reviewed by qualified individuals or

     Based on results from collaborative cyclical testing performed on patch fittings with laminated doors, patch fittings can be used
    with laminated glass in interior applications with controlled temperatures below 75 degrees F. Note that testing was performed
    on panels with 0.060 in. standard PVB, and ionomer. Prior to specifying other laminate thickness or material for use in these
    applications, consult the hardware manufacturer for approval.

XII. Glass Transoms


Fully tempered or tempered laminated glass transoms are those fixed glass panels immediately above the door
opening and often span between the top of the doors and the finished ceiling. These transom lites can be incorporated
into the glass entrance using patch fittings or other transom support methods. Glass transoms using patch fittings
may require mechanical fastening to the ceiling structure, based on weight, size and other design considerations. For
example, see Figure 20.




XIII. Glass Stabilizer Fins

With all glass transoms and sidelites, perpendicular fully tempered heavy glass mullions, sometimes called fins, may
be mounted from the ceiling to the bottom of the transom to reduce the amount of deflection of the glass entrance.
The fin must be mechanically secured and anchored to the overhead load carrying structure. Suspended ceilings do
not provide an adequate structure for attachment of stabilizer fins. Typically, these glass fins are made using ½ in.
(12 mm), 5/8 in. (15 mm), or ¾ in. (19 mm) thick fully tempered glass. For design criteria for the design and use of glass
stabilizer fins, see Section XIV – Structural Design of Interior Glass Entrance Systems.

XIV. Structural Design of Interior Glass Entrance Systems


One of the primary purposes of this Design Manual is to ensure the designer has considered the structural limitations
of the glass and metal fittings, so the fully tempered entrance system will function satisfactorily and safely. Fully
tempered all-glass entrance systems using patch fittings were originally designed in Europe and were used in both
interior and exterior installations. Interior glass is not subject to uniform wind loading, so other loading criteria had to
be developed.

Many interior entrances are designed with the glass panels supported at the head and sill only, without additional
mullions or other lateral support. Interior glass entrances and partitions are typically mounted or restrained at the top
and bottom. They are more susceptible to deflection than glass supported on three or four sides. Some deflection or
vibration in the glass is normal. If the glass system is not designed correctly, fluctuations of interior air pressure or the
operation of a door can temporarily cause the glass to move out of plane, affecting the operation of hardware. Persons
pushing or leaning on glass can also noticeably deflect the glass. As the unsupported vertical span of the glass panels
increases, the glass thickness must be increased, or additional hardware utilized, to limit deflection. In this Design
Manual, the design considerations are separated into two-sided and three-sided support. Uniform horizontal pressures
or other interior loading criteria are not clearly defined in most building codes. The International Building Code (IBC)
limits the differential deflection of two adjacent unsupported sides of the interior glass panels. The recommended
minimum thickness of fully tempered glass required to meet the IBC for adjacent panels that are not linked together
to prevent differential deflection is shown in Table 12 of Section 9 of the Engineering Standards Manual, and Table 1
of Appendix 1 of this manual. By utilizing hardware or applying silicone to the joints of adjacent panels, the thickness
limits shown can be used to reduce differential deflection.

INTERIOR TWO-SIDED SUPPORT
The minimum allowable glass thickness for a given height (H) of heavy glass sidelite panels as shown below in Figure
20 can be determined based on the recommendations shown in Table 1 of Appendix 1 of this manual.

                                              Heavy Glass Door Design Manual




Most interior all-glass entrance systems are designed using ½ in. (12 mm) thick fully tempered or tempered laminated
glass. The following design examples are for ½ in. (12 mm) thick fully tempered or tempered laminated glass. The
structural loading criteria used for two-sided supported panels in this Design Manual was developed using the force
developed by the weight of the glass doors opened 90 degrees to the plane of the entrance as the primary design load
for these interior applications. This load is often greater than the 5 to 10 PSF (0.25-0.5 kPa) interior design load often
stated in building codes.

When a sidelite is located adjacent to a door, this sidelite is often required to support the weight of an operating
glass door. According to Section 2403.4 of the Glass and Glazing Chapter of the IBC, the differential deflection of two
adjacent unsupported edges shall not be greater than the thickness of the panels when a force of 50 pounds per
linear foot is applied horizontally to one panel at any point up to 42 in. (1,067 mm) above the walking surface. Refer to
Appendix 1 for a summary of glass wall deflection limits.

If this sidelite (Figure 20) is too narrow, it does not have sufficient strength to support the weight of the door without
deflecting to the point where the door clearances will be compromised. The graph in Figure 21 is furnished using
common door sizes. This graph is constructed so that if the glass door toe deflects downward more than 1/4 in. (6 mm)
due to the weight of the door, the sidelite is too flexible. If this occurs, the design must be changed, either by securing
the jamb of the sidelite to provide three-sided support or by adding stabilizer fins.

In order to determine if fins are (or are not) required for an interior glass entrance system with two-sided support, the
door width and transom height must be known. See “T” (Transom Height) and “W” (Sidelite Width) on Figure 20. The
maximum height for ½ in. (12 mm) glass is 120 in. (3 m), as shown in Appendix 1, Table 1 must not be exceeded. As
can be seen in the chart, the minimum width for a sidelite that must support the weight of the door is 12 in. (305 mm).
Use “T” and “W” in Figure 21 to establish a reference point. If this reference point is below the door width line on the
chart, fins are not required. If this point is above the line, fins are required to provide additional lateral stability for the
entrance.

INTERIOR THREE-SIDED SUPPORT
An interior glass entrance can often be supported structurally at the jambs, in addition to the head and sill, as shown
in Figure 22. Three-sided support is obtained with the addition of structural members on the vertical edges of the
sidelites adjacent to the doors. If the glass sidelite is structurally supported on three sides, it will deflect much less
than when it is supported only at the top and bottom. Narrower sidelites are stiffer because they are also supported
at the jambs. It is also possible to provide a structurally supported edge for a sidelite by making a 90-degree corner so
that the perpendicular sidelite becomes a full-height structural stabilizer for the adjacent sidelite. Structural silicone

  is often used to connect the glass corner to provide structural adequacy, but 90-degree patch fittings and clamps can

  FOR INTERIOR APPLICATIONS:
  If the sum of the height of the transom “A” plus the width of the sidelite “B” is 72 in. (1,829 mm) or less, the stabilizer
  fins are not required (A + B < 72 in. [1,829 mm]). The traditional method of analyzing the requirement for structural
  glass stabilizer fins was developed in Europe more than 20 years ago. Mechanical fastening will be required when
  transom weight exceeds maximum hardware capabilities; consult the manufacturer for hardware limitations.

  If the entrance is to be used heavily or additional stability is desired, a more conservative formula could be used so
  that fins would be required for smaller openings. Conversely, in applications (such as interior malls) when the doors
  are locked open all day stabilizers may not be needed because of the limited use of the doors. The design professional
  must consider glass strength and deflection for both two- and three-sided glass support using this analysis to
  determine glass fin requirements.

XV. Structural Design of Exterior Glass Entrance Systems


EXTERIOR DESIGN
The method of analyzing the glass thickness requirements for a structural glass exterior entrance is essentially the
same as for any curtain wall or storefront application. The major design concern for an exterior wall is the wind load
pressure. Most exterior glass entrance systems require three- or four-side support for the glass panels using metal
or glass mullions. Although tempered glass is very strong, because tempering does not reduce glass deflection, it is
usually deflection that determines the glass thickness design, not the glass breaking strength. In most wind load zones
the deflection of heavy tempered or tempered laminated glass supported only at the top and bottom is excessive for ½
in. (12 mm) tempered glass if the openings are over 84 in. (2.13 m) high. The major glass manufacturers publish charts
showing the amount of deflection for two-side and four-side supported glass when subjected to various wind load
conditions. Special calculations are required for three-side supported glass; contact your glass engineer.

Weatherstripping is difficult on center pivoted heavy tempered or tempered laminated glass doors. Weather infiltration
around the doors often limits their use in various climatic conditions. Through the use of a double door vestibule
airlock arrangement, the amount of air infiltration into the building can be reduced so that the use of heavy tempered
or tempered laminated glass makes the entrance more energy efficient.

Full-height and cantilevered glass stabilizer fins must often be used for exterior, heavy glass entrance systems, but the
glass system provider or fabricator should provide the design of these stabilizers. The height of the span, the center-to-
center spacing of the stabilizer mullions, and the wind load design will determine the stabilizer depth and thickness.

XVI. Application Guidelines for Fully Tempered and
Tempered Laminated Glass Entrance Systems

CHANNELS AND FRAMING
Perimeter support applications depend upon job requirements such as size of opening, reinforcement to meet wind
load conditions, hardware and design of basic structure.

CHANNELS
1/8 in. (3 mm) thick aluminum channels are often used as perimeter framing. These channels can be clad to match the
metal finish of the door hardware.

See Figure 18 and Table 2 for minimum bite and clearance.

                                                   Perimeter Channels




FRAMING TUBES
Extruded aluminum tubes or any framing member can be used at the perimeter of the opening. These tubes can be
clad with thin-gauge sheet metal to match the metal finish of the door hardware.

ACCESSORY HARDWARE
Different types of accessories are available from various manufacturers. When selecting operating hardware (i.e.
closers, pivots, etc.), the designer should consult the hardware manufacturer’s design limitations, so as not to exceed
the maximum recommended sizes and weights for the hardware system selected. For additional information, contact
the manufacturer or consult their literature.

INSTALLATION
Manufacturers of storefront and entrance systems supply a variety of products that make it possible for the architect
to select systems with a broad range of appearance and structural properties. Manufacturer’s specifications should
be referenced for detailed installation instructions. It is not the purpose of this manual to attempt to point out the
detailed procedures to be followed in assembling and installing a particular entrance, but rather to emphasize the
importance of proper installation in order to obtain a trouble-free entrance. If a satisfactory installation is to be
realized, the installer must become thoroughly familiar with all of these specifications and requirements.

The quality of performance achieved in an entrance depends on three factors: design, manufacture and installation.
These three stages of work may be the responsibility of three different parties: the architect, the manufacturer and the
installing contractor. The end result, therefore, necessarily depends on intelligent cooperation and teamwork. In any
event, the importance of proper installation cannot be overemphasized. No entrance, however perfect in design and
manufacture, will function properly unless it is installed correctly. The opening must be plumb and square, with the
pivots aligned and firmly secured to solid supporting construction with adequate provision for anticipated movements
due to seismic or thermal effects.

THE OPENING
The opening in which the entrance is to be installed must be correctly sized, with plumb jambs and level soffit or
header. Another consideration is the floor and head condition, not only in the plane of the closed door, but also in front
of and through the swing area of operation of the door. Unlevel floors can cause the door to bind in one area and have
excess clearance under the door at the locking position so that the lock bolt will not engage. Since the glass in these
systems cannot be modified or refabricated, it is important that shop drawing measurements be field verified. If the
recommended tolerances are not held, problems are immediately created for the installer of the entrance. If heavy
tempered or tempered laminated glass fins are required, they must be properly anchored to structurally adequate
supports.

INSTALLATION OF CLOSERS AND PIVOTS
The installation of door closers and pivots requires a high degree of precision. If the door is to operate properly, it is
essential that the closer and pivots be installed plumb to each other and level.

Care must be taken to ensure floor reinforcing, electrical conduits or ventilation ductwork does not interfere with the
closer installation because floor closers are embedded in the floor. The process may be complicated by the need to
place the closer housing or cement case in its exact location before the finished slab is poured. Floor closers are often
located near the concrete floor slab edge, so care must be taken to ensure the closer is supported adequately.

Concealed overhead closers are generally installed in an aluminum header that is attached either to vertical or
horizontal load-carrying structural supports. The header must be installed level and the closer spindle must be aligned
and plumb with the bottom pivot.




                                                             30
                                            Heavy Glass Door Design Manual




When “pivot only” doors are used they should be locked in either the open or closed position. Again, it is essential that
the pivots be mounted plumb and level and secured to a load-carrying structural member.

ANCHORAGE
Due to the weight of these systems, frames, sidelites, transoms and structural fins must be properly anchored to the
structure. Special consideration may be required when securing these systems in exterior elevations.

HARDWARE INSTALLATION AND ADJUSTMENT
Certain critical door hardware items such as pivots, locks and panic exit devices should be factory installed, reducing
the chance that misalignment will interfere with proper operation. One of the most critical installations is that of panic
exit hardware because faulty operation may affect emergency egress.

The installation of door closers is also a critical operation and must be done in strict accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions and templates. If the closer is improperly located or mounted, its proper operation
will be affected.

Final operational adjustment of all hardware should be made by the installer of the entrance after all glazing is done
and the building is completed and ready for occupancy. Some types of swing door hardware, such as pivots, may
permit adjustment. Concealed overhead and floor closers can be adjusted to center the door. All closers should be
adjusted in the field to obtain proper door closing sweep and latch speeds. All screws should be checked for proper
torque according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Over-torqueing the screws can strip the threads and
should be avoided.

XVII. Protection and Cleaning


Specifications typically require protection of the installed entrance system until the building is completed. This
must be the responsibility of the general contractor because the installer of the entrance has no control over the
scheduling of work in respect to the final completion date of the job. Frequently, the entrance is installed long
before the other parts of the building are finished. The movement of materials through it, as well as the adjacent
work of other trades, continually subjects it to damage. Adequate protection of the finished entrance components
is essential during this period. The entrance contractor should take reasonable precautions to see that work, when
completed, is protected from damage, but it is the general contractor who must be responsible for maintaining this
protection as long as it is required.

To ensure a long and useful life, a maintenance program should be established for the fully tempered or tempered
laminated glass entrance system. This program should include adjusting of the hardware and periodic cleaning of
the glass and metal parts. Aluminum and stainless steel parts require periodic washing, but brass and bronze, being
copper-based metals, need special care. Copper-based metals are very unstable and are subject to rapid oxidation,
thus creating a tarnished appearance. Certain cleaners can damage glass surfaces while others can damage the
metal finishes.

The Copper Development Association has defined and numbered the copper-based alloys based upon the percentage
of copper, zinc and tin (see Table 1 Metal Finishes). Each of these alloys is a different color, but due to their copper
content all of them will tarnish. Light oxidation will occur due to the moisture and other chemicals present in the air.
A regular maintenance schedule of cleaning with a non-abrasive brass or metal cleaner will easily return the metal to
its natural appearance, help retard oxidation and prevent a heavy buildup of oxidization. Prolonged exposure to water,
fingerprints, and glass and floor cleaning chemicals will accelerate the oxidizing process, creating a heavy buildup
which may require cleaning by a professional metal restoration company.

Some manufacturers offer a lacquer protective coating for brass and bronze metal cladding. The intent of the lacquer
coating is to protect the finish from oxidation during shipping and storage. Lacquer is a soft coating and is susceptible
to scratches during use. The lacquer must be considered temporary, as it may last several months, or it could break
down within a few weeks depending on field conditions. The lacquer coating must be removed with a strong solvent
or paint stripper prior to refinishing. Re-polishing un-lacquered metal with a non-abrasive brass or metal cleaner, and
re-lacquering, can best be accomplished by a professional metal restoration company. Do not attempt to polish a
lacquered finish with metal polish as this can cause immediate breakdown of the lacquer. Special, longer-lasting clear
coatings are available; consult the manufacturer for special maintenance and cleaning procedures for these coatings.

Appendix I. Recommendations for Fully Tempered Interior Butt-Glazed
Fixed Glass Panels

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FULLY TEMPERED MONOLITHIC INTERIOR BUTT-GLAZED FIXED GLASS PANELS
(Reprinted from the Engineering Standards Manual)

The fixed panels of interior glass partitions mounted or restrained on only two sides (top and bottom) require special
design considerations:

Glass held only on two sides is much more flexible than glass supported on all four sides. If the glass is too thin, small
fluctuations of interior air pressure can cause the glass to tremble or shimmer. People pushing or leaning on glass that is too
thin will noticeably deflect the glass. As the unsupported span or height of the glass panels increases, the glass thickness
must also increase to maintain a reasonable stiffness. Table 1 below shows recommended minimum thicknesses of FULLY
TEMPERED MONOLITHIC glass for various glass heights used in interior butt-glazed fixed glass panels.

                                                                           Table 1:

1. These numbers are based on the assumption that bottom of the glass attachment is at the same height as the walking surface.
2. Guidelines based on IBC 2403.4 deflection limit of the thickness of the glass panel.
3. Guidelines for spans up to 10' are based on a deflection limit of 1.5" (based on pullout of less than 1/16"); guidelines for spans greater than 10' are based on
a deflection limit of 2" (based on pullout of 3/32"). Larger deflections should be reviewed by designer.
4. Guidelines based on IBC 2403.4 deflection limit of the thickness of the glass panel and loading from IBC 2403.4.


CAUTIONS:
The following cautions are not addressed in any way by Table 1.

IBC Section 2403.4 states:

  “Interior Glazed Areas: Where interior glazing is installed adjacent to a walking surface, the differential deflection
  of two adjacent unsupported sides shall not be greater than the thickness of the panels when a force of 50 pounds
  per linear foot is applied horizontally to one panel at a point up to 42 inches above the walking surface.”
