Insulated Glass Units
What Is Insulated Glass?
                              ■ Insulated Glass (IG) Units are hermetically
                                sealed combinations of two or more lites of
Standard IG   Custom IG         glass separated by a dry air spacer.
“Dual-Pane“   “Triple-Pane“
  Why use Insulated Units ?
 Improves thermal performance by         Commercial and Residential
  providing a thermal break between the
  glasses                                 applications

                                           IG units will keep heat in during
                                            cold weather and will retain heat

INSULATED GLASS INFORMATION
The following glass can be use:
■   Clear        ■   Reflective

■   Texture      ■   Low E

■   Tinted       ■   Laminated



■ When using glass other than clear you
  must indicate what surface is needed for
  that glass to be placed in the unit.
■ All glass is measured and ordered from
  outside looking in. First glass noted is on
  the face of the unit, Exterior side.
■ Can not do colored glass over colored
  glass – unit will fail
LOW E OPTIONS
Adding a Low E glass to your insulated make-up will improve the overall
performance.
 For a standard hard coat Low E PRL offers:     For better performing Low E, PRL is a
    Energy Advantage from Pilkington            Guardian Soft Coat Low E supplier.

                                                        AG50
INSULATED UNIT SIGHTLINE

 The Sightline is the measurement
  between the edge of glass to the
  inside of the air spacer, once insulated.
       This is usually hidden in the glass stop
 For proper infill this is a minimum of ½”        Sight
                                                   Line
 When using soft coat Low E glass the
  edge deletion will be hidden in the
  Sight Line
INSULATED UNIT GRIDS
■ For a decorative look PRL offers 3 types of grids that can be added.

   Flat Grids                                  Sculptured Grids
      3/16” x 5/8” or ¾”                          5/16” x 1”
      White or Dark Bronze                        White
      Grids cut to overlap                        Grids connected by a four
         each other                                  way connector
INSULATED UNIT OPTIONS
■ Breather Tubes                            ■ Argon Gas
      To be added when units will travel         Added to units with Low e glass
       over altitudes of 4,000 feet
                                                  Improves the shading coefficient
      Allow air pressure inside unit to           and UV value by working with the
       equalize                                    low e coating
      When installed, breather tube is           Special corner keys added to air
       pinched closed                              spacer when Argon Gas is used so
      Can not be used with Argon Gas              that gas can be inserted inside unit
INSULATED UNITS WITH SPANDREL
■ Opaci-Coat 300 is a silicone based paint that can be      ■ Standard Spandrel Colors
  added to insulated units. Spandrel is added to units to
  block objects or features that are behind the spandrel
  glazing, such as between floors of all glass buildings.
  When spandrel is added, silicone seal should be used.
INSULATED UNITS WITH OFFSETS
■ Offset units are offsetting the glass when put together so that a corner will be
  created when installed. You must use silicone seal on all offset units.

                            When ordering both glass sizes are        Two options for adding
                             required for outside and inside pieces     the Secondary Seal
                Inside
                                                                      Filled in Option




                                                                      Step Down Option
