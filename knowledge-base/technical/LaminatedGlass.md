LAMINATED GLASS
                    WHAT IS LAMINATED GLASS?
■ Defined as “Two or more lites of glass permanently bonded together with an interlayer
  material”
■ Our process bonds the glass and interlayer together under pressure and heat



             Glass #2
    Interlayer
 Glass #1
                                LAMINATED GLASS

■ Can be made using:
   – Annealed, heat strengthened or tempered glass
   – Tinted, reflective, patterned, mirror and some low e’s
■ Adds sound-damping
■ UV-blocking properties
■ Considered safety glass
   – If glass breaks, glass fragments adhere to interlayer
        ■   Reducing risk of injury or passage of persons or objects
    –   Meets:
        ■   ANSI safety standards
        ■   ASTM standards for Laminated Architectural Flat Glass

1. Air Table




                                                    4. Nip rollers for
                                                        de-airing

                                    3. Clean room
               2. Washing process
                          LAMINATION VACUUM BAG




• After the laminated glass sandwich has come thru the nip rollers, the glass can not be separated
• Next our technicians examine the piece and determine if a Vacuum bag is needed
• Edges are wrapped with a breather material, then wrapped with a bagging material and hooked up to a
  vacuum
• While in the Autoclave the bagged pieces have a dedicated tube pulling out any possible air left between
  the glass and interlayer
• Pieces using tempered glass, shapes, having holes/cutouts or have multiple layers of glass/interlayer
  must be bagged
LAMINATION AUTOCLAVE
   Last step in lamination process
      Glass is loaded on a steel a-frame
          Glass will be cook in a vertical
            position




                                               While in the Autoclave glass is being
                                                heated and air pulled out at the same
                                                time

            INTERLAYER TYPES – SGP CONT.
SGP Options
■ Clear
   – Rolls
        ■   Thickness .035
        ■   Max 72”
    –   Sheets
        ■   Thickness .090 sheets
        ■   72” x 120” (stock)

■ Translucent White
   – Rolls
        ■   Thickness .030
        ■   Max 60”
INTERLAYER THICKNESSES
■ Annealed
   – Can be made with .030, .060, .070, .090 or
      .105
■ Heat Strengthened or Tempered
   – Minimum of .060 interlayer
       ■ Due to the process of heat treated glass
           each piece may have different distortions
           from the rollers. When sandwiched the
           additional interlayer will fill in this difference
            – 1/8” tempered glass not
               recommended, will have bad
               distortion
■ Textured glass
   – Require .090 interlayer
                         LAMINATING LOW E GLASS


We only laminate using:
    – Energy Advantage from Pilkington
         ■   Hard coat
    –   SN68 from Guardian
         ■   Soft coat – requires edge deletion


Edge Deletion is required for all high performance glass
   • Reduces the possibility of interaction from the
      chemicals in the sealant and the silver layers in the
      glass coating
   • Applications with butt joints will show the edge deletion
                    LAMINATING LOW E GLASS

Two Options for Low E layup
    • Embedded
       • Low E coating in direct contact
          with interlayer
       • Thermal performance is about the
          same as if not using Low E glass
    • Exposed
       • Low E on exterior of laminated
          sandwich
           • to be used in an insulated unit
               facing the air spacer
                      LAMINATION FABRICATION
■ Annealed laminated pieces
   – Fabricated after the lamination process
■ Tempered laminated pieces
   – Must have all fabrication done before being laminated
   – While in lamination process pieces can shift and cause a slight offset
