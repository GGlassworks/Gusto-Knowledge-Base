STEP-BY-STEP FLOOR TILE INSTALLATION
Get the most out of your Marazzi products by following these helpful instructions for installing floor tile.

Dos & Don’ts

Ensure your surface is clean, smooth, dry and free of wax, soap scum and grease.

Carefully read and follow all instructions and precautions on the adhesive or mortar package. Mix only
enough to be used within 30 minutes.

Since variation of shades is an inherent characteristic of ceramic tile, mix tiles from several cartons as
you set, for a blended effect.

STEP 1: SURFACE PREPARATION

Tile may be installed over most structurally sound substrates, if they are clean, smooth, dry and free of
wax, soap scum and grease.

Any damaged, loose or uneven areas must be repaired, patched and leveled.

Remove any moldings, trim, appliances, etc., which could interfere with installation.

Door jambs may be undercut for tile to slip under.



STEP 2: LAYOUT

Begin by marking the center point of all four walls.

Snap chalk lines between the center points of opposite walls, which will intersect at the center of room.
Make sure they're perfectly square and adjust if necessary.

Next, lay out a row of loose tiles along the center lines in both directions, leaving spaces for uniform
joints (use tile spacers). If this layout leaves cuts smaller than 1/2 tile at walls, adjust the center line by
snapping a new line 1/2 tile closer to the wall. Repeat along other center line if necessary.

Now divide the room into smaller grids (approx. 2' x 3') by snapping additional lines parallel to center
lines.
STEP 3: APPLYING ADHESIVE

Select the right adhesive for the substrate you're using. Carefully read and follow all instructions and
precautions on the adhesive or mortar package. Mix only enough to be used within 30 minutes.

Using the type of trowel recommended on the adhesive package spread a 1/4" coat on the surface of
one grid area, using the flat side of the trowel. Do not cover guidelines.

Next, use the notched side of trowel to comb adhesive into standing ridges by holding trowel at a 45-
degree angle.

Then remove excess adhesive, leaving a uniform, ridged setting bed.

Don't spread a larger area than can be set in 15 minutes.



STEP 4: CUTTING TILE

Carefully measure tiles to be cut and mark with a pencil or felt-tip pen.

Make straight or diagonal cuts with a tile cutter, curved cuts with a nipper (chipping away small pieces
for best results) and full-length curved cuts with a rod saw.

Sharp-cut edges may be smoothed with a carborundum stone.



STEP 5: SETTING TILE

Variation of shades is an inherent characteristic of ceramic tile – mix tiles from several cartons as you
set, for a blended effect.

Begin installing tiles in the center of the room, one grid at a time. Finish each grid before moving to the
next.

Start with the first tile in the corner of the grid and work outward.

Set tiles one at a time using a slight twisting motion. Don't slide tiles into place.

Insert tile spacers as each tile is set or leave equal joints between tiles.

Fit perimeter tiles in each grid last, leaving 1/4" gap between tile and wall.

Any rectangle porcelain should never be set in a running bond pattern, rather no more than a 1/3
overlap; the joint should be widened to 3/16" and use of a large unit porcelain mortar should be
employed.

When grid is completely installed, tap in all tiles with a rubber mallet or hammer and wood block to
ensure a good bond and level plane.

Remove excess adhesive from joints with a putty knife and from tile with a damp sponge.

Do not walk on tiles until they are set (usually in 24 hours).
STEP 6: GROUTING JOINTS

Generally, you should wait about 24 hours before grouting (refer to the adhesive package for specifics).

Carefully read and follow all instructions and precautions on the grout package. Make only enough to
use in about 30 minutes.

Remove tile spacers and spread grout on the tile surface, forcing down into joints with a rubber grout
float or squeegee. Tilt the float at a 45-degree angle.

Remove excess grout from surface immediately with the edge of float. Tilt it at a 90-degree angle and
scrape it diagonally across tiles.

Wait 15-20 minutes for grout to set slightly, then use a damp sponge to clean grout residue from surface
and smooth the grout joints. Rinse sponge frequently and change water as needed.

Let dry until grout is hard and haze forms on tile surface, then polish with a soft cloth. Rinse again with
sponge and clean water if necessary.

Wait 72 hours for heavy use.

Don't apply sealers or polishes for three weeks, and then only in accordance with manufacturer's
recommendations.



                STEP-BY-STEP WALL TILE INSTALLATION
Get the most out of your Marazzi products by following these helpful instructions for installing wall tile.

Dos & Don’ts

For wall layout, find the center point of the wall using a level to draw a plumb line in the wall's center.

For countertop layout, begin with counter trim, then set full tiles from the first row working back – thus
all cut tiles will be placed on the back row against wall.

Generally, you should wait about 24 hours before grouting (refer to the adhesive package for specifics).

STEP 1: SURFACE PREPARATION

Tile may be installed over most structurally sound substrates, if they are clean, smooth, dry and free of
wax, soap scum and grease.

Any damaged, loose or uneven areas must be repaired, patched and leveled.

Remove any moldings, trim, appliances, etc., which could interfere with installation.

Door jambs may be undercut for tile to slip under.
STEP 2: WALL LAYOUT

Begin by finding the center point of the wall, using a level to draw a plumb line in the wall's center.

Lay out a row of loose tiles across the bottom of the wall from the center line leaving uniform joints
between tiles. (Marazzi products have integral spacer lugs so tiles can be butted together leaving a
consistent 1/16" joint automatically.)

If this layout leaves cuts smaller than 1/2 tile, adjust center line 1/2 tile closer to the side wall.

Next, determine the lowest point of the floor or tub, using a level horizontally. Stack two tiles here, and
at the top draw a horizontal line on the wall.

With the level, continue the line around all side walls to be tiled. This is a guideline for the first row of
tiles to be set above.



STEP 3: APPLYING ADHESIVE

Select the right adhesive for the substrate you're using. Carefully read and follow all instructions and
precautions on the adhesive or mortar package. Mix only enough to be used within 30 minutes.

                    LARGE FORMAT TILE INSTALLATION TIPS

Get the most out of your Marazzi products by following these helpful instructions for installing large
format tile.

Dos & Don’ts

Large format tile installation requires particular attention to proper substrate preparation, grout joint
sizing, trowel selection and mortar coverage.

When installing large format tile, there must be at least 90% mortar contact and a minimum grout joint
of 3/16".

Large format tile must be installed on a level substrate.

INSTALLATION REQUIREMENT

For proper bonding, medium bed mortar should be used in installing tiles with a dimensional length
greater than 20" x 20", large rectangles or tiles with greater dimensional thickness than normal.

Back buttering tiles of this nature in the installation process will also assure proper coverage for body.




DISCLAIMER

CARE AND MAINTENANCE GUIDE

Marazzi does not manufacture installation products or countertop cleaning/maintenance products. Marazzi provides the information on this
page to its customers as an information source only. Please contact an installation product manufacturer directly, PRIOR to usage, to obtain
proper handling instructions, application instruction and warnings concerning potential health hazards for any product contemplated for use.

To ensure your natural stone products will provide you with a lifetime of beauty and utility, proper maintenance is crucial. Natural stone
products are porous by nature and require a different maintenance program than traditional ceramic tile. Marazzi also strongly recommends
testing a small area PRIOR to usage of any installation/countertop cleaning/maintenance product to determine whether the product serves its
intended purpose.

SAFETY PRECAUTION TO CUSTOMERS

The products described in this document may have chemicals that cause reactions in certain individuals. Marazzi strongly recommends the use
of safety glasses, respirators (masks) and gloves in handling any materials that contain chemicals. Marazzi recommends the proper disposal of
any scrap tile/stone, installation and/or maintenance products discussed herein.

Natural stone has unique qualities that not only distinguish it from man-made materials, but also should be considered in selecting it for a
particular project. Stone is not manufactured; it is a product of nature. Blocks are removed from the quarry, slabs are cut from these blocks,
and the slabs are further fabricated into the final stone to be installed. Each block is different; each slab is different. Skillful blending or
matching of the dimension stone blocks, veneer panels, tops, etc., results in a beautiful blending of nature’s variety and man’s design.
“Uniformity of material,” when applied to natural stone, is a term of relative value that needs to be understood when making a selection.
