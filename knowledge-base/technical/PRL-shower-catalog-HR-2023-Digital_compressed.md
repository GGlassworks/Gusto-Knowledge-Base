    POINTS TO CONSIDER
    • When designing a shower unit three factors one must consider: total height, total width and total square area.
    • The majority of frameless shower units and sliders are assembled using 3/8” and 1/2” Glass thickness
    • The width and weight limitations for sliding and swinging operable doors are determined by the specifications on the
      selected hardware. See specifications per PRLs hardware limitation that must be followed
    • Maximum recommended height and width,

          (A) Height - when two vertical or horizontal edges are supported
          -Maximum for 3/8” glass is 84 inches
          -Maximum for 1/2” glass is 120 inches
                                                                                    A
          (B) Width
          - Maximum for 3/8” glass is 30 inches*
          - Maximum for 1/2” glass is 36 inches*
                                                                                                B



    There are several ways to safely secure the fixed panel from which the door will hinge. One way is to attach the fixed
    panel to a ceiling, securing the top and bottom edges of the glass (Support Elements page 60). Another method is to
    use a Header extrusion across the top of all fixed panels (Headers page 62).

     Unlike sprayed-on coatings, Shower Glass coating is fused to the glass during manufacturing,
     sealing the glass surface to provide a lifetime protective barrier. With regular maintenance shower
     enclosures with Shower Glass will maintain their beauty and clarity for many years to come

     Lab tests put Shower Glass and uncoated glass in a “jungle box” torture test that simulates years
     ofto heat and humidity exposure. After only 175 hours in this test, uncoated clear glass started
     to show signs of haze and was significantly stained at the end proving that shower glass stays
     cleaner longer

                     Tempered glass is always much more resistant to breakage than
                     raw glass. Even if it breaks, the glass disintegrates into relatively
                     small pieces, which is less likely to cause a serious injury. It is very
                     common for glass doors, sidelites, balconies, etc.
