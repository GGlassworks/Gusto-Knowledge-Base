                                                        conformance mark on many products placed on the market in the European Economic Area
                                                        (EEA). The letters “CE” stand for “Coformit´e Europe´enne” (“European Conformity”).
                                                          The CE marking is a key indicator of a product’s compliance with EU legislation, and enables

                                                        product, a manufacturer is declaring conformity with all of the legal requirements to achieve

CRL CUSTOM SERVICES AND CAPABILITIES
   The face of CRL has changed since the inception of our Frameless Shower Door Hardware program nearly 30 years ago. As an early
leader in the market, we were the first to develop many popular stock products used everyday for the installation of the modern frameless
shower enclosure. Continuing in a leadership role, C.R. Laurence Company has expanded it's capabilities, adding to the strength of our
already strong worldwide purchasing power. The result is positive for you – the customer.
   While we continue to stock unprecedented inventory of stock items for daily use, we also realize not every job is the same. The
imagination of architects, designers, and homeowners offers an opportunity to create the most elegant, yet safe enclosure ever seen.
This is where custom products are needed, and CRL can manufacture them to your specifications.

                                   THE “C” IN CRL COULD VERY WELL STAND FOR CUSTOM

  Feel free to send us your drawings and requirements for custom products. Whether it is for Pull Handles, Towel Bars, Clamps,
Hinges, Extrusions, or any other shower related accessory, CRL's Technical Sales Department will review your information and provide
you a timely quotation. A few items may be based on order minimums due to design, while most items are usually available for as few
a quantity as one each. Custom finishes are also available. Although CRL stocks over 20 popular finishes for many of our standard

HAVE I CHOSEN THE PROPER HINGES FOR MY PROJECT?
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION, AND ONE OF THE BEST PLACES TO START WHEN FIRST
BEGINNING YOUR DESIGNING AND PLANNING STAGES
  The question above considers numerous factors. Sometimes it is as simple as aesthetics. What "look" does the customer want?
Other times job site conditions dictate some creativity, or might limit you to a choice of hinges. A safe enclosure should be your primary
concern. Make sure you do not exceed the maximum capacities shown for each hinge in our catalog.
  Shown below is information about common mounting methods. Familiarize yourself with these layouts. Our Shower Door Technical
Sales Staff can assist you in not only selecting the correct hinges, but also with the accessory and component items to put the finishing
touches on the enclosure.

  WHEN IS TWO BETTER THAN THREE?
                                                           It may seem like a logical thought that using three
TWO HINGES                                             shower door hinges will be better than using only two.
OPEN AND AIRY
                                                       This may be required depending upon the door weight
                                                       and door width, which are the two critical factors in
                                                       determining how many hinges are required. However,

                                                       of the hinges required. Secondly, you will save on the

                                                       hinges can encounter over two hinges, when trying to
                                                       vertically align the pivot points of the hinges to have the
                                                       door operate properly
                                                           See the area below that show options CRL provides
                                                       you to accomplish two hinges per door instead of three.
                                                       It is important that you carefully review the pages in this
                                                       catalog showing these hinges. A “Maximum Capacity

                                                       door width dictate a third hinge. However, by moving
                                                       to a slightly larger hinge (that still has the same visual
                                                       characteristics of the smaller hinge), you may be able
                                                       to use only two hinges. As always, if you have any

  EXAMPLE: Your customer chose the Geneva Series Hinges. The Shower door opening is 30" (762 mm) wide x 80" (2032 mm) high.
  Using 3/8" (10 mm) thick glass, the approximate weight of this door is 85 lbs. (39 kg). Reviewing the Maximum Capacity Chart for the
  Geneva Series above, you will see that you have exceeded both the door weight and door width limitations of two hinges, and that three
  hinges would be required. By stepping up to the larger Vienna Series, you are within the limitations for the use of only two hinges.

CRL LOGO
FRAMELESS SHOWER DOOR
HINGES AND HANDLES
• Hnges and Handles Are Manufactured
   With Lasered “Positive I.D.” CRL Logo
• Small Logo on Rear Hinge Plate Appears
   on Inside of Shower Only
• Ideal for Identifying in Retrofit Applications
   to Ensure CRL Quality



  C.R. Laurence Company is proud to manufacture our CRL Brand Frameless Shower Door Hinges and Handles
with a small lasered CRL logo. This positive identification ensures the user that the hinge is indeed CRL quality,
and by appearing only on the rear hinge plate the logo is displayed on the inside of the shower only. This makes
these hinges not only excellent for first time installation, but perfect for retrofit applications by identifying CRL as
the replacement hinge.

   This innovative Atlas Series Hinge gives you the best of two worlds. It
combines minimal hardware and is all wrapped up in this stylish, heavy-duty
Hinge. Two of these double-acting Hinges will allow you to create
‘all-glass’ doors weighing up to 140 pounds (64 kg) with a maximum
width of 39" (1 m). NOTE: Do not exceed two Hinges per door.
   The adjustable spring strength eliminates the need for any closer
mechanism, and will close the door from approximately 50º. When fully
opened, the Atlas Series Hinge will hold open at 90º. These Hinges offer
easy fine-tuned closed position adjustment.

   Our Jamb Mounted Hinge Kits let you provide an ‘all-glass’ look shower door in an
easy-to-install configuration. Water leakage around the door is minimized with the use
of extruded aluminum jambs with vinyl for both the hinge and strike sides, and a clear
vinyl sweep for the bottom. Kits come in your choice of three popular finishes, with glass
cut-out templates and installation instructions enclosed. NOTE: Pulls or Knobs must be
ordered separately. Glass not included.

BASKING IN

ELEGANCE
   Webster's Dictionary describes the word “bask” as “To expose oneself to pleasant
warmth,” and “To thrive or take pleasure.” Well, that certainly describes a creatively
designed frameless shower. Take pleasure in the elegance it brings to your designer
bathroom. Enjoy the pleasant warmth of the showering waters in an enclosure that is
the focal point of a room that most of us spend a lot of time in. Notice the reaction you
get when others see the investment you have made in your home. Nice, isn't it? And
you can make it possible when you work with your local glass shop. Their expertise,
along with CRL's selection of beautiful hardware, is how it's done.

      CRL offers two styles of our Frameless Vertical Post System. They are used to stabilize fixed panels of glass not reaching the ceiling,
   and provide an excellent alternative to customers not wanting to use the more traditional horizontal Header Systems that run across the
   entire width of the enclosure. An especially attractive look is when patterned glass with decorative, rippled top edges is used, since a
   Header System cannot be applied as a crown to the glass.
      Two stock systems are offered the Floor-to-Ceiling Mount System and the Two-Point Ceiling Mount System. Stock Systems are
   prepared for behind-the-glass installation. Custom Systems and finishes are available by simply submitting a drawing to our Frameless
   Shower Door Technical Department. Tube Adaptors/End Caps require holes in glass. Complete mounting details and installation
   instructions can be viewed at crlaurence.com/shower-rods-posts.

  The Deluxe Header Kit will provide additional support and a level of
safety while securing glass panels not reaching the ceiling. Deluxe
Header Kits are designed to allow installers to do in-house fabrication
using a selection of component parts. Sold in 66", 98" or 144" (1.67,
2.49 or 3.65 m) lengths, each Header Extrusion has a narrow 1-1/4"
(32 mm) face to minimize the visible sight line. 90º, 135º or Adjustable
Corners are sold separately (see next page) for angled installations. Also
available is an Adapter Block for use on pivot hinge installations. BWB2
Brass Wall Brackets are included in each kit. A SHB225 Blank Mounting
Bracket is offered separately for installations where the Header does not
meet the wall at 90º, and the standard Wall Mounting Brackets cannot
be used (see next page). Header is constructed of Aluminum Alloy.

   The EZ-Adjust Shower Door Header Kit provides a safe and beautiful
frameless shower installation by securing enclosures that do not reach the
ceiling. Acting as a "crown" over the top of the glass, the EZ-Adjust Shower
Door Header Kit is bracketed to each wall.
   The EZ-Adjust System allows adjustability after installation in that the hinge
(PPH06 or SRPPH06 only) can be moved left and right as desired. No drilling
through the Header is required for an Adaptor Block if using Prima Hinge
Model PPH06 or Senior Prima Hinge Model SRPPH06, due to a built-in
adaptation to the hinges (see pages 440S and 443S).
   ­­Constructed of heavy aluminum alloy, the EZ-Adjust Header Kit is stocked
in up to eight popular finishes. A choice of 98" and 144" (2.49 and 3.66 m)
stock lengths allow the user to cut as desired. A Snap-in Filler Insert for the

   Our Square Support Bar complements many CRL square corner style hinges. The Bar stabilizes fixed panels of glass in
enclosures that do not go to the ceiling. After ordering the Bar itself, choose from a number of various Fittings to complete the
desired application. The Fittings come with nylon-tipped set screws that ­­­­secure the glass and prevent metal-to-metal contact.
Finishes are available to match many popular decors. No holes or cut-outs are required in the glass.

   CRL has expanded the popular Laguna Series Sliding Glass Door line to include optional "Softbrake" Kits and Double Top Roller Kits.
In addition, all kits are now available in either Brushed Stainless or Polished Stainless Finishes, and our most popular kits come in Matte
Black. The NEW “Softbrake” option, for wall mounted kits, provides a controlled, quiet closure and prevents the doors from “slamming”
open or closed. The NEW finish option, and NEW Double Top Rollers give you a variety of aesthetically pleasing options to
accommodate the most ­imaginative designers.
   ­The Laguna Series Sliding Glass Door System can be installed on glass partitions or directly to the side of a sufficiently reinforced wall.
The adjustable Top Rollers make final adjustments quick and easy, without the need to remove the door. Their smooth operation and
solid stainless steel construction minimizes maintenance issues.
    CRL provides you with all the glass attachment fasteners for either flush mounting (requiring a countersunk hole), or surface mounting
(requiring a straight hole). The glass attachment fasteners accommodate either 3/8" or 1/2" (10 or 12 mm) tempered glass and can
easily be secured using our Cat. No. SW19 or LSSW1 Spanner Head Wrenches.
    Standardized sets allow you to make planning and purchasing quick and easy for basic installations. We offer a wide variety of kits
for Wall Mounting or Glass Mounting. We also offer an Adapter Kit, Cat. No. LSWMADT, to convert these Laguna Kits for use with
wood doors.

  The Thru-Glass Pull With Center Plate has a recessed low profile design that is simply screwed together to install. The low profile
design does not impede door movement, allowing for full door opening access. The center plate prevents water escape through the
Pull, while still allowing plenty of room for finger tip control. Constructed of stainless steel, the Thru-Glass Pull With Center Plate is
available in polished stainless, brushed stainless, and matte black, thus providing a good match to numerous CRL Sliding Systems.
Able to accommodate glass thicknesses of 1/2", 3/8" and 5/16" (12, 10 and 8), this Pull is supplied with gaskets to prevent
glass-to-metal contact. A hole in the glass is required for installation (see NOTE above).

   CRL Clear View™ Mirror Defoggers are specially designed thin heating elements that are adhered to the back of mirrors, gently
raising their temperature just enough to keep the mirror dry and clear in high humidity conditions. Wiping moisture off the mirror with
a towel is unnecessary, making shaving and applying makeup easier.
   Low voltage CRL Clear View™ Mirror Defoggers are available in three shapes and in two sizes each that can be incorporated into
virtually any mirror design. They are easy to install by wiring to any power source, but the most common method is to wire to the
bath's 120V AC vanity light switch. Each maintenance-free Defogger carries a five year unconditional guarantee.
NOTE: Maximum temperature is 64ºF (18ºC) above room temperature.
   Custom sizes and 220 Volt models are available on special request. For additional information, contact CRL Technical Sales at
(800) 421-6144 in the U.S., (877) 421-6144 in Canada, or (323) 588-1281 International, and ask for Ext. 7700. You can also send an

CLEANING AND POLISHING
PRODUCTS GIVE YOUR PROJECTS
A PERFECT FINISHING TOUCH
   Give your projects a perfect finishing touch with CRL's complete assortment of quality
cleaning and polishing agents for glass, aluminum, and stainless steel. These easy to apply,
hard-working products are formulated to give you bright, squeaky-clean surfaces.
   Our glass cleaners have been the standard of the glass industry for decades. Hard water
spots and stains can dull the finish of glass and metal surfaces, but with our water spot
removers you can make them look like new again. We also offer cleaners and degreasers to
polish and protect metal surfaces.
   Doing a good cleaning job is always easier with the right tools. Our professional strength
wipes clean surfaces without streaking, and absorb moisture faster than traditional paper
towels. Our squeegees, scrapers, blades, and other maintenance tools are online at
crlaurence.com/cleaners.

Levelers will eliminate the phrase "close enough" from every shower door installer’s
vocabulary. Now every door installation will be a perfect fit.
   Super Shim Levelers are manufactured with non-slip materials which prevent
damage to tile or glass, while still allowing smooth movement where necessary. Each
Super Shim Leveler is 2-1/4" (57 mm) wide and 2-1/4" (57 mm) tall. The thickness
where the glass rests is 3/16" (5 mm). Cat. No. SS2LW Ratchet Wrench is included.
Minimum order is one pair of Levelers.

adjust the lateral alignment of the pivot centers by simply
turning a single screw in either the top or bottom rail of the door.

HOW THE WEDGE-LOCK® GLASS SECURING SYSTEM WORKS
   The patented Wedge-Lock® Glass Securing System is a totally original concept for securing the glass in the
Door Rail. No more fumbling with multiple pieces, trying to align them properly. No more time wasted waiting for
cement to dry, or in clean up.
   The Wedge-Lock® System works by applying pressure evenly along both sides of the glass. Simply tighten the
jaw screws, accessed from the hardware pocket of the rail. The screws then draw down a flat stainless steel bar.
The steel bar in turn pulls down the gripping jaws. This action then forces the jaws towards one another, creating
a tremendous amount of force against the glass, holding it securely in place.
   The Wedge-Lock® Glass Securing System is so unique that it is covered by U.S. Patents 6,434,905 and
6,912,818 B2; Canadian Patent 2,419,706; European Patent EP1 404 939 B1.
