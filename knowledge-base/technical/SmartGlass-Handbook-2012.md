LC SmartGlass™ is used for privacy purposes allowing instant privacy at the flick of a switch. Using a minute
electrical current, users can immediately switch the LC SmartGlass from clear to private (opaque) and vice versa.
LC SmartGlass is easily installed and various configurations can be supplied including colour tinted, fire rated,
double glazed, ballistic, blast resistant, curved and shaped.

SPD-SmartGlass™ can be manually or automatically “tuned” to precisely control the amount of light, glare and
heat passing through. Glass facades using patented SPD light-control technology reduce the need for air
conditioning during the summer months and heating during winter. SPD SmartGlass windows give the ability to
instantly switch a window to maximize daylight when it’s really needed and to provide controllable solar shading
during peak light conditions is unique.

Sample boxes can be sent to perspective clients anywhere in the World, each sample box contains a working
SmartGlass samples with plug, switch and display stand. Please contact us for further details.

Our products foster innovative design opportunities never before available while offering unprecedented
environmental benefits and protection to building inhabitants and contents.

SmartGlass is currently used in hotel room screens between bathroom and bedroom, partition screens, windows,
roof-lights and doors, projection screens, security & teller screens and as architects and designers explore the
boundaries and turn conventional perspectives of glass on their head it is expected that the markets will continue
to grow and expand into new and innovative uses.

Evidence that the trend for increases in SmartGlass sales is visible in the range and locations of projects recently
completed by SmartGlass International including the Rolls Royce engines, Kempinski hotels, Guinness Storehouse,
Siemens, Golbach Kirchner, Top Gear live, ITV Daybreak, Royal College of Physicians, Aramco, various hospitals,
Chevron Texaco HQ, Rolls Royce marine, Damico tankers, Royal Institution of GB, Emirates Airlines, Saudi Arabian
National Guard, European Space Agency, Central Bank of Ireland, Tullow Oil, Chubb Custodial, SMI, Fairline boats,
Zain Bahrain, Zeus Packaging & Pictet Bank.

Since 2003, our products have been sold into more than 45 countries throughout the World and we export
approximately 99% of our production.

Our Sales team will travel throughout the World at short notice to meet with the client. Technical advice will be
provided and every effort will be made to meet and exceed the client’s needs.

Hotel room design is the area where LC SmartGlass is being most frequently used in the World wide market.
We have developed a standard hotel design suite to assist clients in as far as possible when specifying SmartGlass
for use in hotels. Please contact us to discuss your requirements further.

        consideration given to our products qualities, economic value, aesthetic value and life span. Our products
        ultimately reduce green house emissions by enabling users to reduce peak electrical demands on lighting
        and cooling. Our production processes are carried out in a sympathetic manner always with a view to
        maximising recycling and minimising energy consumption and waste.

LC SmartGlass - Privacy on Demand
OVERVIEW
LC SmartGlass™ offers instant privacy at the flick of a switch. All LC SmartGlass panels are bespoke manufactured
using a lamination process which encapsulates a PDLC film between 2 or more glass sheets. Using a minute
electrical current, users can immediately switch the LC SmartGlass from clear to private (opaque) and vice versa.
LC SmartGlass is easily installed and can be utilised in many applications. Various configurations can be supplied
including colour tinted, fire rated, double glazed, curved and shaped.

PRINCIPLE
When the electrical supply is switched on, the liquid crystal molecules align and incident
light passes through and the LC SmartGlass panel instantly clears.

                         When the power is switched off the liquid crystal molecules are
                         randomly oriented scattering light and the LC SmartGlass
                         becomes opaque (private).

OPERATION
LC SmartGlass is operated by applying 65V AC or 110V AC to the glass from a power transformer supplied. When a
current is applied to the glass it immediately turns from opaque to clear allowing vision through. When the
current is removed the glass returns to the frosted “private” state. LC SmartGlass can be operated by wall switch,
radio remote, PIR switch, Crestron, ABX and more...




CONTROLS
       Crestron, ABX, BMS, Wall switch, Remote control, Movement sensor, Timer, Door lock, etc....

SPD SmartGlass - Solar Control
OVERVIEW
SPD-SmartGlass™ can be manually or automatically “tuned” to control the amount of light and glare passing
through a window. While glass is a favored product for use in building facades; glare, solar heat gain and UV
exposure are problematic and can often make the use of glass impractical resulting in the need to invest in
expensive solar shading devices. Glass facades using patented SPD light-control technology reduce the need for air
conditioning during the summer months and heating during winter. The ability to instantly switch the glass to
maximize daylight when it’s really needed and to provide controllable solar shading during peak light conditions is
valuable and unique. All SPD SmartGlass panels are bespoke manufactured using a lamination process which
encapsulates a SPD “Suspended Particle Device” film between 2 or more glass sheets.



PRINCIPLE
When the power supply is switched on, the rod shaped suspended particle molecules align, light passes through
and the SPD SmartGlass panel clears. SPD SmartGlass protect from damaging UV when on or off.
When the power supply is switched off the rod shaped suspended particle molecules are randomly oriented
blocking light and the SPD SmartGlass becomes dark blocking up to 99.4% of light.

MANUFACTURING

The production team at SmartGlass International Ltd uses a combination of experience, technology and skill to
manufacture each SmartGlass panel to the highest levels of quality. In house proprietary manufacturing processes
using an Autoclave lamination process employ heat, vacuum and pressure to produce a multilayer glass sandwich.
Each SmartGlass panel is handmade & bespoke for the clients requirements. The production cycle lead time for
each panel is 3-5 days depending on configuration.

All of the materials used in the production process are of world class standard and while expensive; these
materials ensure premium quality in the finished product.

Each SmartGlass panel is assembled in a climate controlled clean room environment. Production employees are
empowered to strive for World class manufacturing standards and individually sign off each bespoke made panel
after manufacturing and testing.

After manufacturing, cleaning and wiring each SmartGlass panel is tested by switching approximately 57,000 times
in rapid on/off sequence.

SmartGlass can be manufactured into various shapes including holes in the film. (Contact us for detailed
explanation) All panels are bespoke manufactured and cannot be cut after manufacture.

SmartGlass™ is real life field tested for in excess of 14 years.

SMARTGLASS PANEL
LC & SPD Smart films are laminated between two or more pieces of glass.

Liquid crystals - the same technology is used in digital watches, TV’s and computer screens. Liquid crystals are
sandwiched between two layers of transparent conductive film to make LC Smart Film. The film is then laminated
between two pieces of glass. When electricity is applied to the film the liquid crystals line up and the window is
clear (slight haze). When the power is turned off, the liquid crystals return to their normal positions and turn the
glass from clear to opaque. 2 wires exit the top of each unit where they are connected to a copper bus bar.

Note: Framing needs to hide 15 mm where the bus bar is visible, generally at the top of the SmartGlass panel.

Energy Transmission Measurements

To provide a better understanding of what these figures are measuring, the brief explanation below discusses the
various spectrums of energy created by the sun. These are the same energy spectrums that building products and
windows must endure on a daily basis. Some of the characteristics are positive and ones that we want to
maximize, while others are detrimental and must be reduced or controlled in some manner.
Electromagnetic energy from the sun is broken into a variety of categories or spectrums based on the wavelength
of the energy. The three main spectrums that affect the building products industry, people and furnishings in
commercial and domestic settings are UV, Visible Light and Infrared energy. Read on to see how SmartGlass can
not only achieve immediate privacy on demand but can control, protect and enhance building environments.



ULTRA VIOLET - UV

UV energy is not visible to the human eye and is typically broken into three categories: UVA, UVB, and UVC. UVC
energy is mostly rejected by the earth’s atmosphere, never reaching the earth’s surface. UVB and UVA energy pass
through the atmosphere and reach the earth’s surface. As it pertains to the window market, most of the UVB
energy is blocked by standard float glass. Clear double pane windows will reject almost all of the UVB energy.




                                                       22
Therefore the remaining UVA energy is the primary target. UVA energy passes through standard float glass, and
can only be blocked by coatings or films that are capable of reflecting or absorbing this spectrum of light such as
our SmartGlass technologies. UVA energy is the primary component responsible for fading of furnishings, art work
and overall deterioration of fabric quality.
The more a window product can reject or absorb the sun’s UV energy, the longer the life and quality of the items
being protected. All window products should strive for the lowest UV transmission value possible.



VISIBLE LIGHT
Visible light is the only portion of the sun’s spectrum that human eyes can see including natural daylight and all the
colours of the rainbow. Visible light has mostly good attributes associated with it but eye strain associated with
glare can cause serious problems for building occupiers. Natural light is often desired to make a home or building
feel open or well lit. Large amounts of natural light will also reduce the need for lighting in a given structure, thus
reducing utility costs. Windows that are tinted will have lower visible light transmission values. It should be noted
that large amounts of natural light can also increase the amount of glare. This unwanted element can be
aggravating in rooms with televisions or computer monitors and areas in office buildings where employees have to
combat uncomfortable and often dangerous glare levels. SmartGlass allows the user to control visible light
transmission and by choosing grey or blue tinted versions for specifically bright areas the user is protected and
inhabits a safer and more comfortable environment.


INFARED – IR
Infrared energy relates to the heat energy that is emitted from the sun and is also referred to as radiant heat.
Infrared energy is light that our eyes cannot see, but which our bodies can detect as heat. The radiant heat energy
emitted by the sun in the solar spectrum is typically classified as Near Infrared (NIR) energy. This is the energy one
feels as heat when standing in the sun. This is the same energy that hits a window surface and transmits through
the glass to increase the temperature inside a building. Being able to “control” this near infrared energy
transmission value allows a window to control the amount of heat that is added to a building by the sun.
Decreasing the infrared transmission value of a window will decrease the amount of heat energy added to a
building, thus reducing over-heating effects that occur in summer months and in hot climates. The use of
SmartGlass protects building occupants and significantly reduces carbon emissions and costs associated with air
conditioning and cooling. The ability of a window using LC SmartGlass™ to reject infrared energy will be directly
related to a window’s Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC). The lower the Infrared Transmission Value the lower the
corresponding Solar Heat Gain Coefficient.

BALLISTIC RESULTS
LC Smartglass has passed a number of ballistic tests with many different combinations of laminated glass and with
many different calibre rounds up to standard BSEN 1063:2000 threat level BR6. Please contact us for further
information and test results.




HAZE
It should be noted that LC SmartGlass is not optically as clear as normal float glass. A haze in the form of clouding
in the glass is considered normal and is unavoidable due to the nature of the product makeup. It should also be
noted that ambient lighting conditions will have an effect on haze levels; direct lighting onto LC SmartGlass should
be avoided. Every precaution has been taken to ensure minimum haze. Tinted glass can be used to reduce the
visible haze such as blue, green or grey tints. It is essential that the end client understands that a degree of haze
will be present depending on configuration and will not be considered as a reason for exchange or refund.

GLAZING GUIDELINES

Interior Butt Joint Glazing

SmartGlass™ panels can be butt glazed using a recommended minimum of 9 mm in glass thickness. Long edges
will be polished giving an even vertical finish. Panel thickness will vary depending on several conditions including
the height and span of the glazed area. We will recommend the ideal glass thickness to protect against bowing
and to provide safety, fitness for purpose and adherence with legislative guidelines.

A standard neutral cure structural silicone sealant may be used to close the joint as specified by us. A minimum of
a 4 mm separation between panels is recommended. Alternatively a plastic “H” section will be used instead of
silicone to dry join panels.

Refer to applicable local building guides for design load requirements regarding interior glazing. Safety and
suitability for purpose will be treated as the main driving factors in assessing suitability for butt joint glazing. Note:
Not all internal applications will be suitable for butt joint glazing and support framing may be required.




Operable Doors & Windows
Swing door & windows can be glazed with SmartGlass.

Cable connectors will be used to protect wires travelling between the door and frame where the wiring is then
connected to the transformer/ power conditioner. Contact switches can also be used.

INSTALLATION
Clients and their installers should inspect each piece of SmartGlass immediately prior to start of installation.

Do not install items which are improperly sized, have damaged edges, or are scratched, abraded, or deficient in
any other manner.

Do not remove labels where provided by SmartGlass International until so directed by the Architect, client or site
manager.

Adhere to all SmartGlass™ installation instructions and installation drawings.

Locate setting blocks of standard width and thickness at quarter points of all glass panels unless otherwise
recommended by manufacturer or supplier.

Use setting blocks of proper durometer, size and thickness to support the glass in accordance with the
manufacturers’ recommendations.

Glass lap and edge clearances must be provided according to relevant standards of the manufacturers.

If the installer has any questions or concerns, please immediately contact your local SmartGlass representative.




SURFACE CONDITIONS
Examine the areas and conditions under which work of this section will be performed. Correct and make good
conditions detrimental to timely and proper completion of this work. Do not proceed until unsatisfactory
conditions are corrected. After preparation of the glazing system the glazing channels, stops and gaskets should be
cleaned to receive the SmartGlass materials, making free from obstructions and substances which might impair the
work at hand. Comply with manufacturers' instructions for final wiping of surfaces immediately prior to
application of primer and glazing compounds or tapes
USE ONLY SUPPLIED NEUTRAL CURE SILICONES, 1 tube will be supplied with each SmartGlass panel.
DO NOT USE ACETIC SILICONES.

Install glass in a manner which produces the greatest possible degree of uniformity of appearance.

Do not install glass in dynamic frames such as operable windows or sliding doors, without the consent of
SmartGlass International Ltd.

Glazing to exterior and wet interior conditions must be wet-sealed and impervious to moisture with provisions to
allow for weeping of condensation that may infiltrate of condensation in the system. Electrical connections must
exit at the head of any framing system using SmartGlass panels in wet environment applications

Pressure glazing systems without positive positioning stops are not to be used with SmartGlass.

The glazier should place all electrical connections & wires properly to allow easy access by an electrician.

Cut and seal joints of glazing gaskets in accordance with the manufacturers' recommendations to provide
watertight and airtight seal at corners and other locations where joints are required.




                                                          37
GLAZING METHODS
Wet Glazing: If an elastomeric (non-acetic) sealant is used, it must be compatible with the SmartGlass panel
interlayer. Never use putty or glazing compound to glaze SmartGlass.

Exterior Applications - Insulated Glass Units made with SmartGlass can be installed as per normal glazing with the
exception of accommodating the unit wiring. SmartGlass is suitable for glazing to steel, timber, aluminium and
UPVC framing systems.

Wet Glazing: Pre-shimmed glazing tape and non-acetic sealants are required to create a seal impervious to
moisture for all exterior applications.

Butt-Joint Glazing: SmartGlass panels can be butt-joint glazed in interior applications (Long edges polished
recommended).

Non-Acetic Sealants
Smartglass International Ltd only recommends SOUDAL SLIRUB 2 as the sealant for use in butt-joint glazed
SmartGlass panel systems. 1 tube will be supplied with each SmartGlass panel as standard.

Structural Silicone Glazing: Insulated glass units manufactured with SmartGlass should not be structurally silicone
glazed unless agreed in advance & in writing by SmartGlass International.



FRAME DESIGN
Frame edge clearance and face clearances may be used, except the edge bite must be 10 mm minimum and
framing must include a hole of 6 mm diameter to pass wires through. To maintain a proper seal against the
infiltration of water and air adequate bite and sealing is required.

Inadequate clearance for the edges can cause damage due to glass-to-metal contact. Minimum edge clearances
should allow for a tolerance of ±1.5mm. This should only be increased if the surrounding materials tolerances are
difficult or impossible to control.

The industry standard for framing deflection must be adhered to. The deflection must not exceed either the length
of the span divided by 175, or 18 mm, whichever is less. All expansion joints and anchors must be designed so that
the glass framing does not incur a load due to structural movement.

Glass larger than .66 square meters should be placed on four EPDM or neoprene setting blocks. These blocks
should have a durometer hardness of 85±5. They should be centred at the bottom quarter points (i.e. equal
distance). The blocks should be 1.5 mm narrower than the channel width. Lock-strip gasket systems also require
setting blocks. Recommendations can be obtained from the gasket manufacturers.

Once the SmartGlass is installed, the architect, general contractor, or building owner should provide for glass
protection and cleaning. Weathering steel such as Cor-Ten or alkaline materials may cause surface damage due to
staining. Abrasive cleaners should never be used, particularly when the surface to be cleaned has a reflective
coating. Windblown objects, welding sparks, plaster, or other material applied to the glass surface during
construction may cause irreversible damage.

SmartGlass International Ltd will not be held liable for damage caused by others; the main contractor is
responsible for protection of glass on site following delivery & installation.

SHIPPING AND RECEIVING


SHIPPING
Where applicable we manufacture shipping crates for all individual customer orders. These crates allow
for protection of glass in transit but correct handling methods should be observed when off loading. Note:
It is the responsibility of the client to off load glass deliveries unless otherwise agreed prior to dispatch.

If no preferred carrier is specified, the SmartGlass panels for domestic customers will be shipped through
our ground carriers. For overseas customers, specifying whether the freight should be shipped via Air or
Sea is necessary. Where available, it is recommended to have the clients own agent to take care of the
shipping and customs clearance issues. We can do so, at additional cost.

Due to the difficulty in estimating the accurate weight and dimensions of the crate at the time of giving a
quotation, the panels will be shipped Freight Collect with the full value insured. Alternatively an estimate
will be provided and confirmed prior to despatch.




                                                          44
RECEIVING

Before signing for and accepting the shipment from the carrier, inspect the crate(s) for the following
items: a. Inspect crate(s) for visible damage.
        b. Check Tip 'N Tell indicator where used.

If damage to any of the panel(s) is found, the shipping documents should be so noted and the driver's
signature obtained as a witness. You should inform SmartGlass International immediately of any
damaged panels. Photographs should be furnished within 24 hours. A freight claim should be filed to the
carrier as early as possible. If you fail to inspect the shipment, the carrier and SmartGlass International
Ltd. are not responsible for damage.




UNCRATING
Ensure the crate is on a level surface. Before removing the lid unscrew screws which are holding the lid
down. Be careful to lift the lid off the crate level on all corners. Remove straps holding panels on. Remove
the panels carefully, one at a time, using the appropriate lifting methods.

Warning: Loose cables from LC SmartGlass panels are not to be used for lifting, moving or positioning the
LC SmartGlass™ panels. Ensure not to snag cables whilst lifting.




STORAGE
Glass edges frequently sustain damage due to careless handling at some point between manufacture and
installation, Handle with care. If the SmartGlass is to be stored on the job site or in warehouse conditions,
proper blocking and protection should be maintained at all times. As with other flat glass products, the
SmartGlass panels must be stored where the relative humidity is less than 80% to prevent the SmartGlass
from staining. The SmartGlass temperature should be held nearly constant to prevent moisture
condensation on the panels. Storage temperature range is -20 +50 °C (-4° +122°F). The crate should be
kept in an upright position or tilted at 5° - 7° from vertical at all times using broad, sturdy uprights to
support the weight of the crate. Alternatively the SmartGlass should be stored on a glass “A” frame in a
position free from obstruction, traffic and danger.

Note: SmartGlass panels can be heavy at approximately 27.5 kg/m2. Please be careful and take the
weight loads into account when moving and storing.

ELECTRICAL INSTALLATION

SUPPLIES NEEDED
Installation of SmartGlass panels require the following items:

 A 16 AMP (minimum) Residual current device (Rcd) with Miniature circuit breaker (Mcb) or a Residual current
circuit breaker with overload protection (Rcbo) must be used along with a fused spur at the connection point for
the panel for localised isolation.

A wall mounted switch, 230VAC 50/60 Hz (installer/owner supplied). This switch is required to allow the
SmartGlass panels to be turned ON/OFF. Alternatively a radio remote control switch can be specified.

SmartGlass power transformer. SmartGlass panels may be connected in parallel up to 4 square meters total area
per single Tim 100 power conditioner/transformer. Bespoke electronic controllers can be used including “smart”
systems such as Creston and ABX controllers.

Note: Larger Power Conditioner / Transformers can be supplied to power larger areas of Smartglass, please contact
us for further information.

INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
As with any electrical device, SmartGlass must be included in the electrical layout for each project. E.g. Position of
spurs, switching layout, containment (conduit, trunking etc to house cables) connection boxes etc. The installation
must meet all local rules and regulations. Also any metal frames which could come in to contact with the wiring of
the panel must be earthed. Smartglass international is not responsible for these layouts however we can be
contacted for further information.


POWER TRANSFORMER / CONDITIONER DETAIL

WIRING

SmartGlass International requires that all SmartGlass electrical installations be completed by a licensed electrician,
and in compliance with all local rules and regulations.

Before installation, inspect bus bars, electrode leads and wires to assure insulation. No exposed bus bars,
electrode leads, or wires should contact any metal frames that will damage the transformer and SmartGlass. Any
metal frames must be earthed.

Multiple SmartGlass panels should be connected in parallel with the transformer. Insure that the transformer "in"
connects to 230V AC and "out" connects to SmartGlass panel. The output voltage is approximately 115V or 65V
depending on the type of film used.

Before turning on the power, test resistance reading between the metal frame and electrode and make sure that
the resistance reading is infinite. Otherwise, check short location and insulate electrodes from metal frames.

SmartGlass uses approximately 5 watts per square meter in the "on" (clear) state. No electricity is consumed in
the "off" (opaque) state. SmartGlass can be controlled with either a single or multiple switches or by radio remote
controller.

NOTE: It is vital for correct operation that the switch/remote receiver is positioned on the mains voltage before the
transformer/power conditioner. Failure to correctly install the switching mechanism may cause irreparable
damage to the LC SmartGlass.

Ensure the mains supply is switched off and take care when opening the power transformer, allow a few minutes
to cool down. Internal electronic parts may be very hot, this is normal. Only open the power transformer in the
areas noted safe for opening, never open the sealed body of the power transformer.

Warning: Do not substitute a higher fuse rating! Fuse rating is critical to properly protect SmartGlass panels. A
spare fuse is included on the inside cover of the power transformer supplied.

MAINTENANCE

Maintenance is generally as simple as keeping the SmartGlass clean. Regular cleaning with neutral
materials is recommended for optimum performance. In external windows soapy warm water performs
best. Soft coated glass should be cleaned very carefully following the manufacturers own instructions. Use
professional glass cleaner or a reputable cleaner.

Annual checks: The client should check that all wiring is in good condition, framing materials are free of
any damage and that the transformer and switch are in good visible order. The areas adjoining the
SmartGlass including walls, ceilings and floors should be checked for structural integrity, excess humidity
and temperature. Should any of these items appear unusual the client should immediately notify the
original supplier / installer / contractor or SmartGlass International.




TROUBLE SHOOTING
LC SmartGlass operates at 110V or 65V AC and 50/60 Hz. Higher voltages and frequency may cause permanent
damage.

Electrical service must be performed by a qualified electrician who has read and understood this document.

Switch the power ON. Verify that the SmartGlass panel switches. If one or more SmartGlass panels are not
operating, check the following

1. Check the circuit breaker to verify power. If there is not power from the circuit breaker, reset or replace the
circuit breaker.

2. Visually check the condition of all wiring and that connections have not been broken.

3. Check the switch to verify power. If there is no power from the wall switch check the connection or replace the
switch.

4. Check input to the power transformer of affected panels to verify power. If there is not input power to the
power transformer, check the wiring between the wall switch and the power transformer for damage and
continuous current flow.

5. Check output from the power transformer of affected panels to verify power. If there is no output power from
the transformer, the fuse may have blown. Replace fuse with the same size and specifications which is available at
electronic supply shops such as RS. Each transformer contains a spare fuse inside the protective cover.




If in any doubt, please contact us to resolve your issue.

Top Gear Live has a reputation for pushing the boundaries of car theatre and each new tour requires incredible
technology, passion and dedication to deliver the spectacle our audiences have come to expect. For the 2010/11
Prototype Tour I needed a company who could help me make a car turn from solid to transparent at a touch of a
button. SmartGlass International were a great partner working meticulously with me to develop the car panels
required for this unique hyper car and proved to be the perfect solution to a problem no one thought they’d ever
have; how do I turn my car see through?
Rowland French, Top Gear

“We at Kentish Town Sports Centre have found the installation of Smart Glass to have been of great benefit to the
service we provide to our many and varied customers.
 We run 'women only' swimming sessions for religious reasons or for other privacy issues and this means that we
can have our pool in 'privacy' mode or 'open' mode for when the pool is being used for children's swimming
lessons when parents like to observe from a distance. We have had no maintenance issues with this facility and
would recommend this product to anyone in a similar circumstance to ourselves.”
Grant McCahon, Kentish Town Sports Centre
