11.15 Glass Manufacturing

11.15.1 General1-5

        Commercially produced glass can be classified as soda-lime, lead, fused silica, borosilicate, or
96 percent silica. Soda-lime glass, since it constitutes 77 percent of total glass production, is discussed
here. Soda-lime glass consists of sand, limestone, soda ash, and cullet (broken glass). The
manufacture of such glass is in four phases: (1) preparation of raw material, (2) melting in a furnace,
(3) forming and (4) finishing. Figure 11.15-1 is a diagram for typical glass manufacturing.

        The products of this industry are flat glass, container glass, and pressed and blown glass. The
procedures for manufacturing glass are the same for all products except forming and finishing.
Container glass and pressed and blown glass, 51 and 25 percent respectively of total soda-lime glass
production, use pressing, blowing or pressing and blowing to form the desired product. Flat glass,
which is the remainder, is formed by float, drawing, or rolling processes.

        As the sand, limestone, and soda ash raw materials are received, they are crushed and stored in
separate elevated bins. These materials are then transferred through a gravity feed system to a weigher
and mixer, where the material is mixed with cullet to ensure homogeneous melting. The mixture is
conveyed to a batch storage bin where it is held until dropped into the feeder to the melting furnace.
All equipment used in handling and preparing the raw material is housed separately from the furnace
and is usually referred to as the batch plant. Figure 11.15-2 is a flow diagram of a typical batch plant.

         The furnace most commonly used is a continuous regenerative furnace capable of producing
between 45 and 272 megagrams (Mg) (50 and 300 tons) of glass per day. A furnace may have either
side or end ports that connect brick checkers to the inside of the melter. The purpose of brick
checkers (Figure 11.15-3 and Figure 11.15-4) is to conserve fuel by collecting furnace exhaust gas heat
that, when the air flow is reversed, is used to preheat the furnace combustion air. As material enters
the melting furnace through the feeder, it floats on the top of the molten glass already in the furnace.
As it melts, it passes to the front of the melter and eventually flows through a throat leading to the
refiner. In the refiner, the molten glass is heat conditioned for delivery to the forming process.
Figures 11.15-3 and 11.15-4 show side port and end port regenerative furnaces.

         After refining, the molten glass leaves the furnace through forehearths (except in the float
process, with molten glass moving directly to the tin bath) and goes to be shaped by pressing,
blowing, pressing and blowing, drawing, rolling, or floating to produce the desired product. Pressing
and blowing are performed mechanically, using blank molds and glass cut into sections (gobs) by a set
of shears. In the drawing process, molten glass is drawn upward in a sheet through rollers, with
thickness of the sheet determined by the speed of the draw and the configuration of the draw bar. The
rolling process is similar to the drawing process except that the glass is drawn horizontally on plain or
patterned rollers and, for plate glass, requires grinding and polishing. The float process is different,
having a molten tin bath over which the glass is drawn and formed into a finely finished surface
requiring no grinding or polishing. The end product undergoes finishing (decorating or coating) and
annealing (removing unwanted stress areas in the glass) as required, and is then inspected and prepared
for shipment to market. Any damaged or undesirable glass is transferred back to the batch plant to be
used as cullet.

11.15.2 Emissions And Controls1-5

         The main pollutant emitted by the batch plant is particulates in the form of dust. This can be
controlled with 99 to 100 percent efficiency by enclosing all possible dust sources and using
baghouses or cloth filters. Another way to control dust emissions, also with an efficiency approaching
100 percent, is to treat the batch to reduce the amount of fine particles present, by presintering,
briquetting, pelletizing, or liquid alkali treatment.

         The melting furnace contributes over 99 percent of the total emissions from a glass plant, both
particulates and gaseous pollutants. Particulates result from volatilization of materials in the melt that
combine with gases and form condensates. These either are collected in the checker work and gas
passages or are emitted to the atmosphere. Serious problems arise when the checkers are not properly
cleaned in that slag can form, clog the passages, and eventually deteriorate the condition and efficiency
of the furnace. Nitrogen oxides form when nitrogen and oxygen react in the high temperatures of the
furnace. Sulfur oxides result from the decomposition of the sulfates in the batch and sulfur in the fuel.
Proper maintenance and firing of the furnace can control emissions and also add to the efficiency of
the furnace and reduce operational costs. Low-pressure wet centrifugal scrubbers have been used to
control particulate and sulfur oxides, but their inefficiency (approximately 50 percent) indicates their
inability to collect particulates of submicrometer size. High-energy venturi scrubbers are
approximately 95 percent effective in reducing particulate and sulfur oxide emissions. Their effect on
nitrogen oxide emissions is unknown. Baghouses, with up to 99 percent particulate collection
efficiency, have been used on small regenerative furnaces, but fabric corrosion requires careful
temperature control. Electrostatic precipitators have an efficiency of up to 99 percent in the collection
of particulates. Tables 11.15-1 and 11.15-2 list controlled and uncontrolled emission factors for glass
manufacturing. Table 11.15-3 presents particle size distributions and corresponding emission factors
for uncontrolled and controlled glass melting furnaces, and these are depicted in Figure 11.15-5.

         Emissions from the forming and finishing phases depend upon the type of glass being
manufactured. For container, press, and blow machines, the majority of emissions results from the
gob coming into contact with the machine lubricant. Emissions, in the form of a dense white cloud
that can exceed 40 percent opacity, are generated by flash vaporization of hydrocarbon greases and
oils. Grease and oil lubricants are being replaced by silicone emulsions and water soluble oils, which
may virtually eliminate this smoke. For flat glass, the only contributor to air pollutant emissions is
gas combustion in the annealing lehr (oven), which is totally enclosed except for product entry and
exit openings. Since emissions are small and operational procedures are efficient, no controls are used
on flat glass processes.
