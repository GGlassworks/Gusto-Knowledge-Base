              These installation instructions are generic in nature but specific to the PRL Classic glass bottom rolling system
              doors. Because each project will have differing conditions, each project should have job specific drawings
              prepared by journeymen drafters or engineers who are familiar with the product & constructions details &
              have an intimate understanding of PRL’s products & how to integrate them into the construction details spe-
              cific to the project it is being used on. The shop drawings will take precedence over these instructions as they
              are project specific. When in doubt contact prl technical representative.

              Engineering calculations & shop drawing review should be performed by a professional engineer. We sell
              only to bona fide professional glazing contractors & expect that you employ seasoned journeymen who have
              apprenticed & been trained in all aspects of fenestration construction & assembly. We expect that you are
              familiar with, & have installed products of same & similar type. You should be aware of local building codes
              & practices & be sure to comply with them. PRL has no ability to ensure you are complying & practicing in
              accordance with them & assumes no responsibility for your compliance.

              Coordinate with your sealant supplier to be sure you are using the correct sealants. Coordinate with the
              sealant supplier to be sure of compatibility & adhesion with all glass, aluminum & building components. Have
              your sealant supplier test for compatibility & adhesion with all glass, aluminum & building components on
              each project you perform & give you a written report stating that all materials conform. These installation &
              assembly instructions refer you to areas where caulking seals are required. In each case you must fully clean
              the surface the caulking is to adhere to. You will clean using sealant manufacturers recommended solvents.
              You will use adhesion primers or adhesion promoters that the sealant supplier recommends to you.

              These instructions show one of many acceptable steps to fabricate & install the system. It is not always neces-
              sary to follow these instructions in the exact order we have suggested but you should be familiar enough with
              the construction or PRL’s products, should you decide to deviate & specify an alternate order of fabrication &
              assembly. vWhen in doubt contact PRL technical representative.

              Isolate & separate aluminum products from steel, masonry & cementitious materials.

              We recommend a heavy coat of bituminous paint.

              Check all shipments from PRL immediately upon receipt thereof.

              Check for damage, count & quality.

              Inform you PRL service representative immediately of errors, omissions or questionable quality.

               Frameless & all glass doors are manufactured from fully tempered glass with polished edges. They are very
               heavy.
               Extreme care should be taken when moving, handling & installing this product.
               Failure to be cautious in your handling could result in significant injury or even death.

               Check the glass both before & after installation for chips in the edge of glass. Edge chips in tempered glass
               can result in spontaneous breakage at any time & should not be used or should be replaced.

               PRL’s products are constantly being refined, improved & expanded. Check for latest bulletins & publications.

               PRL offers multiple rail options for this product. They all operate & function the same. We have shown one
               type of rail, but the installation instructions are pertinent to all rails. If in doubt contact your PRL technical
               representative.

               These installation instructions show you the method of installation for a 2 leaf (known as OX) sliding door, the
               addition of multiple more leafs is the same as for each of the leaves we have depicted here.

               If in doubt of any item or procedure contact your PRL technical representative.

               Documents applicable & supplemental to these installation instructions include but not limited to the follow-
               ing. We expect that you, the professional glazier are familiar & compliant with them all.

                                          INSURE ROUGH OPENINGS ARE TRUE & SQUARED & OF CORRECT SIZE




Install head track to substrate.
Fastener size & spacing should be
per your engineers design.

Minimum should be 1/4 diameter
fastener, 2” from ends & no greater
than 12” on center.

The first track is the critical install
as it will set the placement of the
other tracks & sill.

Removal of glass from door rails is a difficult & dangerous task.

                                                                                                               lass
Glass shards will be flying through the air & there is a great danger to the glazier.                      en g
                                                                                                       Brok
You must wear eye, hand, face & other protection beyond that of OSHA requirements.

For the sake of this re-glazing procedure we have assumed the glass has been broken.

 Re-use of the top & bottom rail may not be possible. We have used rockite brand hydraulic cement to
adhere the glass & rail to each other.

Your attempt to remove it may destroy the rails beyond repair.



 You will need to chisel out all traces
 of glass & rockite cement.

 You may find an air chisel to be                                       Remove end caps
 faster & easier

  This is an extremely dangerous
 task, wear eye, face & hands
 protection.




 Once rail is clean enough for
 re-glazing re-attach the end
 caps.

 Support rail in vertical position.

 Place (2) 1/2 x 1/8 x 2 rubber
 setting blocks in rails glazing
 channels

 Place glass in rail & support in
 vertical position so it cannot move
 or move in the rail.

 Mix rockite per manufacturers in-
 structions & poor in front & back of
 track until track is full with no voids.


 Allow to set per manufactures
 instructions.

 Turn over & repeat process for
 other rail.

 When set reinstlall per previous
 instructions.
