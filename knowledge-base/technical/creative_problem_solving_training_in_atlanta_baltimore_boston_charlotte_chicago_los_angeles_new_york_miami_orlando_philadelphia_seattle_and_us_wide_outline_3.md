Problem-solving experts recommend the use of specific problem solving
models or the systematic approach to create solutions more efficiently,
smoothly and quickly. This Creative Problem Solving workshop teaches you
the steps, tools and skills needed to implement a creative and systematic
problem solving process.
The Creative Problem Solving training course teaches you the entire problem
solving process - from identification of the problem to the implementation of
the selected solutions, the various tools for data gathering, data analysis,
evaluating potential solutions and selection of solutions to implement, how to
identify improvements after the implementation and much more.
This comprehensive and valuable training course is now available across the
U.S., including Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Birmingham, Boston, Charlotte,
Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Jackson, Los Angeles, Manhattan, Miami, Orlando,
New York, Philadelphia, San Antonio and Seattle.




What You’ll Gain:
In the past few decades, psychologists and business people alike have discovered that
successful problem-solvers tend to use similar processes to identify and implement the
solutions to their problems. This process works for any kind of problem; large or small.
This Creative Problem Solving workshop will give you an overview of the entire creative
problem solving process, and teaches you key problem solving tools that you can use every
day. This course can help you unleash your inner self and put you on the path to thinking
and processing data more creatively.
