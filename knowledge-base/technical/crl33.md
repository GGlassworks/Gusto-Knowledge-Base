    Our new Electronic Egress Control Handles are a more economical
method to control access into or out of areas that call for security, and
still maintain the beauty and view of an “all glass” door. When the
handle is pushed an electronic switch releases the magnetic lock at
the top of the door. For your convenience, we have designed the
handles so they are ready to install on 36" to 48" wide doors ranging
in height from 90" to 102" tall without any modification. Installations can
be made on single doors or double doors. Please consult your local
building codes as they relate to electromagnetic locking hardware for
applicability.                                                                                                                    Electric Deadbolts
    Stock Electronic Egress Control Handles are manufactured so the
horizontal bar will be centered at 42" from the bottom of a 96" door.
When using the Stock Handles on shorter or taller doors the horizontal
location will change accordingly, not to exceed 48" or lower than 36"
from the floor, which conforms with current Uniform Building Code
requirements for hardware location. Please check your local codes for
additional requirements.
    If you want a specific location for the horizontal bar you will need
to order a Custom Handle. Please contact CRL Technical Sales at                                       SPECIFICATIONS

 and serve as a “floating” indicator of their presence. They can make it
 more difficult to pinch fingers or clothing between glass panels. Clamps
 come with two different length studs for use with 3/8" to 1/2" (10mm to

 simply putting a 3/32" drill in the round hole in the beveled edge and
 turning. 1-1/2" diameter circular Clamps are available with solid brass

IMPORTANT: All Series 400 European Mid-Size Patch Fittings on this page are designed to work only with 3/8" (10mm) glass. The Patch Fittings work only with other
Series 400 European Mid-Size Patch Fittings with 2-9/16" (65mm) setbacks. The Inserts used in the fittings are made especially for them, and cannot be replaced with
Inserts from our standard size Patch Fittings. However, Top and Bottom Free Swinging Pivots will work with the Mid-Size Patch Fittings (see page F64). Each Mid-Size
Patch Fitting is supplied as a complete unit, and includes the appropriate Insert and Cover Plates.

 CRL Roton Full Length Hinges

  to align doors perfectly from top to bottom. Special self-lubricating polyacetal load bearing blocks

     The CRL PR70 Series of Multi-Size Adjustable Spring Power
  Surface Mounted Door Closers are a range of Closers offering
  A.D.A. Barrier-Free (low opening resistance), Delayed Action
  models to allow adjustable delayed closing, and heavy-duty full
  range models for full door control of heavier commercial doors.
  They are also available in Bright Gold and Polished Chrome
  finishes to complement most architectural finish requirements.
  The Delayed Action feature adjusts the time a door will remain
  open to facilitate ease of progress through the opening. This
  feature is particulary valuable in health facilities and public
  buildings that require door closers to momentarily stay open.
  Closing and latching speed controls are independently
  adjustable, and an adjustable backcheck feature helps prevent
  damage to the closer, door, and adjacent structures should the
  door be violently swung open due to wind or heavy pedestrian
  traffic. All PR70 Closers are U.L. listed and warranted for ten
  years. Parallel Arm Brackets and mounting hardware are
  included with each closer permitting universal installation for
  regular, top jamb or parallel arm applications. Optional
  accessories, such as Drop Plates and Hold-Open Arms
                                                                                PR70 SERIES SURFACE MOUNTED DOOR CLOSERS
  are available for special installations. (See page F96).

     These Low Profile Floor Mounted Door Closers are preferred
  for many types of installations because they only require a
  shallow 1-9/16" depth cut-out in the floor. This is especially
  important on floors above the ground floor. The shallow cut-out
  leaves enough remaining floor under the Closer to support the
  weight of heavy doors. The spindle collar height supplied with
  the Closer is 1/8" (3 mm). Spindles with other collar heights are
                                                                                                                   Specifications:

      Modern design demands have begun to
  push the envelope to maximize the "All
  Glass" concept in architecture. With this
  concept in mind, the "Spider" type of glass
  fitting was developed. Spider Fittings are
  designed to create all glass curtainwalls, and
  carry the loads associated with wind load
  and stack pressure. They transfer these
  loads to the structure, either through the                            4-Way Post                 Fin-Stabilized 4-Way               Fin-Stabilized 1-Way

  Post Mounted Spiders, or to the floor and

      C.R. Laurence has assembled a line of
  “Spider” type components to fit most needs
  of designers choosing to work with this style
  of glass fitting. Not only do we stock the
  basic fittings themselves, but we have
  gathered accessory parts that can be used
  to put the finishing touches on the job.                              3-Way Post                2-Way Heavy-Duty Post               Fin-Stabilized 2-Way

the built-in infrared sensing device. To close the window, simply
step away and the two panels automatically close.
   The Automatic/Off/Manual Switch provides three different
window settings: Automatic operates with the infrared sensing
device; Manual operates with a jamb mounted push button;
Off defeats all functions and closes the two panels.
   Features include two panels that simultaneously open
outward towards the customer, burglar bar for extra security,
low voltage 24V DC system, and a UL/CSA Approved Class 2
Transformer. Custom sizes and custom paint colors are

  CRL Deluxe Shower Door Header Kit
  Fits 5/16" (8 mm), 3/8" (10 mm) and 1/2" (12 mm) Thick Glass
   • Secures Shower Enclosure Not Going to Ceiling
   • Snap-in Filler Insert for Door Pocket Included
   • Available in Up to Eleven Finishes
      The Deluxe Header Kit will provide additional support and a level of safety while
  securing glass panels not reaching the ceiling. Deluxe Header Kits are designed to
  allow installers to do in-house fabrication using a selection of component parts. Sold
  in 66", 98" or 144" lengths, the double profile extrusion has a narrow 1-1/4" face to
  minimize the visible sight line. A choice of facing edges (round or flat with mitered
  edges) is possible by simply reversing the extrusion. 90°, 135° or Adjustable Corners
  are sold separately. Also available is a special Adapter Block for use on pivot hinge
  installations. A 2-1/4" Blank Mounting Bracket is offered for installations when the
  Header does not meet the wall at 90°, and the standard Wall Mounting Brackets
  cannot be used. Header is constructed of Aluminum Alloy 6463. This Header Kit is
  adaptable to Senior Prima or Prima Hinges. Junior Prima Hinges should be used
  with the Junior Header Kit on next page.

  Brackets and Standards, and Masonite Doors

   Our Semi-Assembled Showcase Kits are furnished with a satin
anodized aluminum frame and quality components. The kit arrives
with the bottom part of the frame attached to the base, so your
assembly time is substantially reduced. The base is constructed of
3/4" thick black finish melamine with a white finish deck that gives
a better background for displayed items. The front of the finished
case has a visible opening of 30" top to bottom.
   Kits are available in three popular lengths: 4, 5 and 6 feet. You
supply the 1/4" (6mm) glass. All kits are shipped with steel shelf
brackets and pre-punched steel standards. You can also use the
KV 180A Series Shelf Brackets found on page 228 of our Big Red
Master Catalog. Each kit comes with 1/4" thick masonite doors
that slip easily into the pre-installed aluminum track with rollers
for smooth, quiet and long-lasting operation.

  different keys to operate each lock. The Master Combination Key allows you to
  change the lock to accept any one of the eight keying combinations you choose.
  This lets you change combinations between shift changes, or in cases where a
  key might have become lost or stolen. The quick combination change maintains                                     Keymatic Cylinder                                           16 pin tumblers of stainless steel to

CRL 3MTM V-Groove and Edge Bevel Tape
• Instantly Changes Glass From Ordinary to Elegant
• Can Be Used on Most Any Smooth Glass or Mirror
• Three V-Groove and Four Edge Bevel Widths
   With 3MTM V-Groove and Edge Bevel Tapes you can give
ordinary glass and mirror that expensive “cut glass” look without
the high price, long lead times, and all the extra work. Our
selection of three V-Groove and four Edge Bevel widths will give
you many design alternatives because these tapes completely
change the appearance of glass by creating the illusion of a
V-Groove or Bevel. Use them to change ordinary looking cabinet
doors into elegant cabinet doors. Give the illusion of depth by
applying it to the edges of 1/8" glass or mirrors. It can even serve
as a “floating” indicator of the presence of large glass partitions in
                                                                                                 V-Groove Tape

combined to produce designs that would be impossible to
fabricate by machine. They are really amazing to see, and add
value wherever applied.
   V-Groove and Edge Bevel Tapes have tremendous adhesion
when properly applied to clean, smooth glass surfaces (especially
float glass), will resist edge-lifting and yellowing, and have                                   Edge Bevel Tape

  CRL Touch-Up Markers
     Our Touch-Up Markers have a high gloss finish that will
  cover scratches on metal beautifully, and can be a real time
  saver to the glazier. They replace paint brushes or standard
  black felt tip markers. Use them for thin scratches, to touch up
  cut ends of extrusions, or for covering screw heads. Vary the
  hand pressure of the point and you can adjust the width of
  the stroke. Positive-seal cap prevents the marker from drying                                                                                                                                                    CAT. NO.                             COLOR

it is permanently connected to a power source.

     CRL’s Window Sash Balance Program offers you a complete selection of Window Channel (Block and Tackle), Overhead, and Spiral or Tubular
  (Tension Rod) Balances for single or double hung aluminum, vinyl or wood windows. Our expanded program includes accessory components in
  individual kits for single repairs, and in economical bulk packages for large projects or fabrication. Large orders (10 or more) of Window Sash
  Balances can be ordered with factory installed top and bottom guides, or end clips.
     On the following pages we will show you how easy ordering and replacing Window Sash Balances can be. As shown in the the diagram above
  there are two basic types of Window Sash Balances: Channel and Spiral. Overhead Balances are a channel type of balance located in the
  overhead channel of the window. Only one is required per window. While all Window Channel and Spiral Balances are sold individually, we
  recommend that you purchase balances in pairs for each window to be repaired. This will restore the sash to a near new condition, and prolong
  the life of the window.
     We also recommend that whenever you replace Window Sash Balances be sure to check the guides, take-out clips, sash cams and terminal
  clips, as age and weathering can make plastic and nylon parts brittle and worn. Even metal parts will show fatigue and wear with constant use,
  so be sure to inspect them as well.
     CRL carries a complete selection of accessories and tools for Window Sash Balances. On the following pages you will find all you need to
  replace or repair a Window Sash Balance, as well as ordering information and helpful installation tips. Along with our wide selection, we also offer
  expert in-house technical and ordering assistance. If you don’t see what you need, simply send us a sample of what you need and we’ll search
  our extensive sources to find the appropriate part for you. See opposite page for where to send your samples.

  guides separately. Shown below are ten of the most common top and bottom guide combinations found in the field today. Simply take the top and
  bottom guide from the window channel balance being replaced and match them with the guides listed below. Each kit gives you a top and bottom
  guide, as well as two rivets and a take-out clip. The Repair Kit, along with the channel, gives you everything you need for the replacement.
  Remember, to set the rivets you will need a Cat. No. H3740 Rivet Installation Tool shown on opposite page.

 Spiral Window Balances
 Removal and Installation Guidelines
      Spiral Window Balances are easy to replace if you follow these simple removal
  and installation guidelines. You must take care not to damage the accessory parts
  (tilt mechanisms, sash carriers or spiral bar clips), and always use the appropriate
  Tensioning Tool when adjusting the spiral rods. If you notice any of the accessory parts
  are worn or damaged when you remove the sash, we recommend you replace them at
  the same time you replace the window balance. This will save you from possibly having
  to remove the sash again to replace the accessories. If your window has different
  accessories than shown on these pages, contact our Technical Sales Department at
  (800) 421-6144, Ext. 777, and we will locate the right part for your particular need.




  Step 1
  Tilt Window Sash Removal
  A. Raise the sash and tilt it inward by retracting the tilt latches.
  B. Press down on the side of the sash. This will allow for sash removal from the frame.
  C. Gently remove sash stops and vinyl balance covers when necessary .

     You always wanted a table that would not just allow you to do
  your screening, but would also allow for storage of screen wire and
  other materials needed. You’ve seen them in other shops, but have
  put it off, thinking that you don’t want to pay the freight on a fabri-
  cated table, or put up the the hassle of sending drawings and
  specs to a manufacturer to have one custom built.
     Now with one call to us, we can ship our new Screen Table Kit
  to you via U.P.S. The CRL Screen Table Kit, when assembled, will
  provide you with a table surface of 32 square feet, and 64 square
  feet of storage area. Upon arrival all you have to do is tap the                          Cat. No. P8060R
  framework together, and add 48 x 96 inch pieces of particleboard
  or plywood, which you provide.

   The CRL Screen Table Jig Set makes fabricating window screens easier
because it keeps the screen frame square and in proper alignment while
you roll in the screen wire and retainer spline. It can be used on any shop
table, and sets up quickly and easily. The set has five extruded aluminum Jig
Bars in lengths from 28 to 84 inches. The bars are drilled should you want to
permanently mount the two longer bars on the corner of the table. The other
bars remain unmounted so you can move them to accommodate screens of
any size. The set also includes 12 extruded aluminum Jig Clips that slip over                                                                           3/8"
the bars along the four sides of the screen.                                                                           Jig Clip    Countersunk

   These clips secure your screen frame to the bars while you first roll in
the screen wire, then the retainer spline. They are infinitely adjustable so you
can change between screen sizes in just seconds. Additional Jig Clips for
3/4" or 1" frame are available in sets of four. Best yet, the whole set ships
economically via U.P.S. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t have                                                                               Table

   The Super ShuttleTM Hand Held Applicator makes precision laying,
notching, cornering and splicing a simple one-step process in the manufacture
of insulating glass units using Super SpacerTM. The applicator glides on the

the vision area, thus permitting its use with air float tables, caster tables, or
suction cup supports. The Super ShuttleTM ensures straight sightlines                             CAT. NO.                        DESCRIPTION

   The CRL Autostock Scratch Removal and Polishing Systems offer a revolutionary process that removes scratches quickly and cleanly from
virtually any type of glass, from tempered to single strength, right in your shop or on the job site. The hand held tools use a vacuum process in
conjunction with a continuous flow of slurry through the machine. With adjustable water jets providing lubrication to keep the machine moving freely
over the glass, the flow of slurry provides a constant source of new abrasives. This process keeps the glass cool and allows the tool to reach
polishing speeds of 6000 RPM. A reference manual and training video are included with each kit.

CRL Portable Router NEW FEATURES
• New Improved Version of Our                          • Cuts Any Shape
  Most Popular Glass Router                            • Easy to Use
• Lightweight and Manueverable
   Our popular ADR Router has new features that deliver more power and better
performance than ever before. The long-awaited Cat. No. ADR2 is a glass working
marvel. This corded, 110 Volt variable speed (10,000 to 30,000 RPM) machine is
rated at 600 Watts. With very little practice this tool can cut almost any curve or
radius while leaving you a structurally sound piece of glass. You’ll be amazed at the
intricate shapes that can be cut with this Router! Mirror outlets, switch plates, cir-
cles, speak holes and desktops with computer/phone wire cut-outs are easily fabri-
cated with the ADR2.
   The biggest advantage of the ADR2 is that it can plunge cut it’s own starter
holes. No need to stop and drill a pilot hole before routing. This means less down
time and more production. Also, there is no changing, charging and purchasing
multiple batteries. Using our new 1/8" diameter Router Bits, combined with an
operating speed of 14,000 RPM’s increases the travel speed to 6"-7" per minute
when working with 1/4" (6mm) glass. Edge quality is unsurpassed because of the
excellent control you have with the ADR2. Using our new Diamond Bits, chipping
on the glass edge is limited to 1/16" or less. Our new 1/8" Diamond Router Bits are
now economically priced due to a breakthrough in technology and our quantity
buying. Check our website for the complete selection.
   The ADR2 comes complete with the Router and Base, 5-pack of Diamond
Router Bits, one 1/4” Seaming Bit, Cooling System with Pressure Tank, Diamond
Coolant, Special Valve Assembly, one roll of Glass Protective Film, and a complete
Instruction Manual. Our Cat. No. ADR2T Deluxe Kit comes with all of the above
plus Cat. No. TPS Router Template Option and a Steel Template Guide with
                                                                                                             PORTABLE ROUTERS AND ACCESSORIES

  Streamlined styling, rugged construction and the affordable price makes our
CRL Upright Wet Abrasive Belt Sander ideal for use by glass fabricators and
processors. The CRL Wet Belt Sander is designed to use various grit 4" x 106"                                              Belt Guard Safety Shield
wet or dry abrasive belts to sand edges to whatever finish is required. Both
models include a direct drive, One H.P., 60 cycle, 1725 RPM, 110 Volt AC motor
and a 5" diameter drive pulley. Sander can be wired 220 volts at an additional
cost. An electric water valve keeps the belts wet during sanding, and can be
connected to a city water system. To solve the problem of water tank spray
corrosion, we've replaced the steel tank with a Non-Rusting Fiberglass Water
Tank. Securely fastened with six mounting bolts, the tank is trimmed with rugged
U-Channel. The 2200RP comes with a urethane covered roller platen and a front
rest guide bar. The 2200 comes with a PA100 Platen Adapter, which allows the
addition of glass edging accessories. Both models feature the New 2200SS Belt
Guard Safety Shield. See below for more information on this new safety feature.                                     Non-Rusting Fiberglass Water Tank                                     CAT. NO. 2200RP

 • The Newest Addition to CRL's Wet Belt Sander Line
 • Built-In Roller Platen and Easy Belt Changing System
 • Now with Belt Guard Safety Shield
   The CRL 4" x 106" Wet Belt Sander is a rugged glass working machine. Built for use in production shops, this
machine has that "classic" sander look with all of the advantages you would expect to find in a modern machine.
Manufactured to precision tolerances, the GL4W delivers high volume usage with very little periodic maintenance
and virtually no scheduled service. All parts are carefully machined and balanced to ensure smooth, quiet operation.
Sealed bearings are used within the motor and drive components for top-notch reliability.
   The GL4W has five built-in rollers at the front of the tank to act as a rest for your glass while sanding. The built-in
water spray system removes all harmful glass dust particles before they can become airborne. The spray system is
activated automatically by an electro-mechanical solenoid when the machine is turned on. Belt tension and tracking
is maintained by a unique upper bracket assembly which allows the sanding belt to run dead center on the two
massive steel pulleys, while belt tension can be maintained and infinitely adjusted throughout use of the GL4W.
Industry standard 4" x 106" Sanding Belts can be changed in a matter of seconds; a convenient feature of daily
operation. Now equipped with a Belt Guard Safety Shield to protect the operator from flying debris. Powered by a
One H.P., 115/230 Volt, 3450 RPM, Single Phase industrial motor, the GL4W has more than ample power for your
high production sanding needs. It is backed by a one year manufacturer's warranty, with parts, belts and
accessories, available directly from CRL.

  CRL Vacuum Cup Holster
  • Finally a Way to Hold Your Wood’s Powr-Grip
    Vacuum Cup When You’re Not Using It
  • Keeps Your Cup at Your Side Ready to Use
     Developed by a glazier, the VCH1 Vacuum Cup Holster combines
  safety and convenience by keeping your vacuum cup readily
  available while in awkward positions, such as when working on a
  scaffold or ladder. This reduces the risk of injury by keeping your
  hands free, rather than having to hold the cup at all times.
     Made from top grain cowhide, the Vacuum Cup Holster is strong
  enough to withstand the daily abuse of a glazier’s work, but soft
  enough to cradle your vacuum cup and protect it from sharp edges
  that often lead to a cup’s failure. There is also a leather strap
  with a steel snap that holds the cup in place until ready for use. The
  Holster fits belts up to 2-1/4" wide. The VCH1 is available exclusively          Fits All Wood’s 8" POWR-Grip                     CAT. NO. VCH1

  additional cut and abrasion resistance in case of contact with a glass

  no glazier should be without.

  Package Features for CRL Silicones
  • 10.3 Fl. Oz. Cartridges Are 30 Per Case; 1440 Per Pallet
  Packaging quantities for C.R. Laurence Cartridge Silicones match industry standards
  of 30 per case. 1440 cartridges per pallet reduces load shifting during freight transport
  because the cartons stack together tighter.
  • Innovative Screw-On Nozzles
  Our Innovative Screw-On Nozzle is standard on every cartridge of CRL33S, RTV408 and
  95C Silicone. It’s 4" long and tapered so you can trim it to the right bead size for your
  requirements. It even has markings to show you where to trim it for an exact 1/8", 1/4" or 3/8" bead.
  • Press-In Hand Holes Make Lifting Easier
  By pushing in a 3-1/2" wide perforation on each end of our silicone cartons, you
  will have an easier time lifting and moving these products where you need them.
  • "WHMIS" Safety Label Shown on Cartridges and Cartons
  Each CRL Silicone Sealant cartridge and carton contains important "WHMIS" (Workplace Hazardous Material Information System)
  safety data. It's shown in English, French and Spanish to comply with shipping regulations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

CRL Tremco 440 II Butyl Architectural Tape
   Tremco 440 II is a pre-formed butyl sealant in tape form. The
100% solids compound of butyl and polyisobutylene contains no
solvents or other volatiles that could escape on exposure, causing
shrinkage and sealant failure. Tremco 440 II forms a watertight seal
to prevent water infiltration, and has superior weather resistance.
Highly adhesive, it remains permanently elastic, even at low
temperatures, and is adaptable to many different types of glazing
systems. It is available in two colors: aluminum or bronze/black.

   The BTB Cut-Out System offers today's auto glass installer all the

   The CRL Retainer Clip                   RC1T
Insertion Tool is a vast
improvement over the first
clip tools introduced years ago.
THE PROBLEM:
Clips have a tendency to wobble off
center when placing them onto the pinchweld.
The tight proximity of trim panels around the
pinchweld only aggravates this condition.
THE SOLUTION: The RC1T Clip insertion Tool. The jaws of the tool are
machined with recesses so proper grip depth is assured. A handle is
welded on the side of the tool so articulation of the tool can be
accomplished without your hand pressing against the glass of
the slider. This tool securely grips the spring clip so accurate
placement can be made without deflection.                                           CRL’s Slider Buddy

CRL Auto Glass Rivets
                   Important Information About Automotive Rivets: Automotive Rivets used for regulator and door
                                                  handle applications are the split rivet type. The stem is part of the structural strength of the rivet, and must
                                                  remain in the rivet after application. Two important factors make this happen: Using the proper grip range
                                                  rivet, and being sure to use the special automotive nose piece in your rivet gun. The rivet stem has
                                                  serrations on it that are crimped tightly at the rivet head by the special automotive nose piece. If you use
                                                  a rivet that does not fall in the proper grip range, the serrations will be below the crimping area, and when
                                                  the rivet stem breaks, the stem will be propelled into the outer door panel causing a “dimple” dent. Use
                                                  caution and select the proper rivet for your application.

  with older sliders and working towards the newer products, you will see how easy it is to know what
  you are ordering, plus what tools and products will be required.
