How Our Technical Sales Team Can Help You - As Easy As 1,2,3
   Although CRL offers thousands of stock products with short lead times, custom designs will require more time and planning. This is when
CRL excels. All we require from you is a drawing that puts to paper your vision of the final product. Our Technical Sales Representatives will
then work with you to take this image to a new phase. Architectural drawings can be created, and ideas exchanged until the final ordering and
production process takes place. The example below shows how a simple black and white drawing evolved into the final product that pleased
our customer and, more importantly, their customer.

General Explanations on Food Service Barriers
What are Partition and Barrier Posts?
   CRL Partition and Barrier Posts provide an almost invisible barrier between the customer
and the food preparation areas. Partitions are vertical glass walls held in place by partition
posts. They are designed to protect the food, and keep the customer from having any
access to it. In recent years a lot of the food preparation has moved from the kitchen to
the service line. No service is offered in this area, but visually it allows the customer to view
the various selections being prepared and help determine their choice of entree. Partitions
are also used as Booth Dividers and Area Separation Walls. The large variety
of shapes, finishes, and sizes will cover most stock and custom applications.


What are Sneeze Guards and Food Shields?




                            Full Service Models                                                                                              Self-Service Models
  CRL Sneeze Guards and Food Shields protect food from sneezes and provide protection from the human breath zone. They fall into
two categories: Full Service models that restrict access to the food by the customer, and usually have a top shelf for plated foods that are
assembled by a server; Self-Service models (commonly used at Salad Bars) that allow the customer to serve themselves. This usually
consists of a slanted piece of glass that protects the food from the breath zone as specified by CRL (see guidelines above). Full Service
and Self-Service models are frequently combined to suit the needs of various dining establishments.
