    allowed for a 1/8" shim space. The exterior perimeter of the window was sealed with
    silicone.

7.0 Test Results: (Continued)

   Note 1: The tested specimen meets (or exceeds) the performance levels specified in
   AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S.2/A440 for air leakage resistance.

   Note 2: With and without insect screen.

   Note 3: The deflections reported are not limited by AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S.2/A440
   for this product designation. The deflection data is recorded in this report for special
   code compliance and information only.

   Note 4: Loads were held for 10 seconds.

   Note 5: Tape and film were used to seal against air leakage during structural testing. In
   our opinion, the tape and film did not influence the results of the test.
