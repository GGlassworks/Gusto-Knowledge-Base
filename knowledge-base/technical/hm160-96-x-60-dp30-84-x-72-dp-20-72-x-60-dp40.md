7.0 Test Results: (Continued)

   Note 1: The tested specimen meets (or exceeds) the performance levels specified in
   AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S.2/A440 for air leakage resistance.

   Note 2: With and without insect screen.

   Note 3: The client opted to start at a pressure higher than the minimum required. Test
   results are reported under Optional Performance.

   Note 4: The deflections reported are not limited by AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S.2/A440
   for this product designation. The deflection data is recorded in this report for special
   code compliance and information only.

   Note 5: Loads were held for 10 seconds.

   Note 6: Tape and film were used to seal against air leakage during structural testing. In
   our opinion, the tape and film did not influence the results of the test.

Alteration #1:   Date – 10/18/11
                 Cause for alteration – Specimen #1 Failed water penetration test.
                 Remedial action taken – Moved exterior sill face weephole. Moved center
                   sill leg weepholes. Enlarged interior webbing weephole.

Alteration #2:   Date – 10/17/12
                 Cause for alteration - Specimen #2 Failed water penetration test.
                 Remedial action taken – Changed weatherstripping to triple fin. Added
                   two weepholes to exterior sill face. Cut roller track to 1-1/4" from
