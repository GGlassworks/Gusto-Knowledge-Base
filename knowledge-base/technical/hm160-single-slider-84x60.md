    Note 1: The tested specimen meets (or exceeds) the performance levels specified in
    AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S.2/A440 for air leakage resistance.

    Note 2: With and without insect screen.

    Note 3: The client opted to start at a pressure higher than the minimum required. Test
    results are reported under Optional Performance.

    Note 4: The deflections reported are not limited by AAMA/WDMA/CSA 101/I.S.2/A440 for
    this product designation. The deflection data is recorded in this report for special code
    compliance and information only.

    Note 5: Loads were held for 10 seconds.

    Note 6: Tape and film were used to seal against air leakage during structural testing. In
    our opinion, the tape and film did not influence the results of the test.

Location of Air Seal: The air seal between the test specimen and the test wall is detailed
below. The seal is made of foam weatherstripping and is attached to the edge of the test
specimen buck. The test specimen buck is placed against the test wall and clamped in place,
compressing the weatherstripping and creating a seal."
