Clean Energy Tax Incentives: Elective Pay Eligible Tax Credits
                                                   The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) makes several clean energy tax credits available to businesses; tax-exempt organi-
                                                   zations; state, local, and tribal governments; other entities; and individuals. The IRA also enables entities to take advantage of
                                                   certain clean energy tax credits through its elective pay provision (also colloquially known as direct pay). Elective pay allows
                                                   several types of entities, such as tax-exempts and governments, to treat the amount of certain credits as a payment against tax
                                                   on their tax returns and as a result receive direct payments for certain clean energy tax credits.
