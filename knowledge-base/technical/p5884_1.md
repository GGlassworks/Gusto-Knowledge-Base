IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration Tool User Guide and Instructions

User Guide and Instructions Overview
Introductory Note
Section references are to the Internal Revenue Code unless otherwise noted.
This User Guide and Instructions uses the term "taxpayer" inclusively to refer to any legal entity (business,
organization, government (including tribal governments)) that can earn one or more of the credits under
the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) and the CHIPS Act of 2022 (CHIPS) that can be monetized with
an elective payment or credit transfer election under section 6417 or 6418, even if the entity could never
be subject to federal income tax. Other terms used in this User Guide and Instructions include:
• "Applicable entity" – a defined term for purposes of elective payment
• "Eligible taxpayer" – a defined term for purposes of IRA credit transfers and elective pay under CHIPS
• "Registrant" – the taxpayer who submits a registration request (which in the case of the parent of a
 consolidated group of corporations may not always be the taxpayer that earned the credit)

IRA and CHIPS Credits – Pre-Filing Registration
IRA and CHIPS enable taxpayers to take advantage of certain manufacturing investment, clean energy
investment and production tax credits through elective pay or transfer provisions. A taxpayer who intends
to make an elective payment or credit transfer election must complete the pre-file registration process to
receive a registration number. The registration number must be included on the taxpayer’s annual return
as part of making a valid election. To facilitate this, the IRS has created a new IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Regis-
tration tool. This User Guide and Instructions will help registrants navigate the tool.
This User Guide and Instructions includes general information and instructions on the following topics:
• Path to monetizing an IRA/CHIPS Credit with an elective payment or a transfer election (note that CHIPS
 only allows for an elective payment election)
• Accessing the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool
• Creating one or more Clean Energy Online accounts
• Information about the pre-filing registration process, including:

 ◦   IRA/CHIPS Credits dashboard and basics of navigating within the tool
 ◦   Email notifications
 ◦   Collection of information at the taxpayer/entity level
 ◦   Collection of information regarding facilities/properties for specific credits
 ◦   Information entry (including a limited bulk data upload capability)
 ◦   Registration submission case review statuses
 ◦   Registration numbers
 ◦   Registration amendments
This User Guide and Instructions is not a legal or technical guide for:
• Understanding general business credits, including computing and reporting credits on a tax return
• Earning an IRA/CHIPS credit
• Qualifying for bonus credit amounts

The IRS welcomes comments regarding users’ experiences with this new process and technology. Please

accepts comments only and is not a forum to obtain assistance with use of the tool.


Path to Monetizing an IRA/CHIPS Credit with an Elective Payment
or a Transfer Election
The IRA clean energy credits and the CHIPS credit are general business credits under section 38. Elective
payment under section 6417 or section 48D(d) and the transfer election under section 6418 create alter-
native ways for applicable entities and eligible taxpayers who have earned one of the IRA clean energy or
the CHIPS credits to get the benefit of the credit even if the taxpayer cannot use the credit to offset tax
liability. This section of the User Guide and Instructions provides a brief overview of the steps a taxpayer
must take to monetize one or more of these credits with the elective payment or transfer elections.
• IRA Credits

 ◦   Elective Pay: Elective pay allows applicable entities (as defined), including tax-exempt and
     governmental entities (such as a local government) that would otherwise be unable to claim these
     credits because they do not owe federal income tax, to benefit from some clean energy tax credits
     by treating the amount of the credit as a payment of tax. With elective pay, an applicable entity that
     qualifies for a clean energy credit can notify the IRS of its intent to claim the credit and file an annual
     tax return to claim elective pay for the full value of the credit. The IRS would then pay the applicable
     entity the value of the credit.
 ◦   Transfer Election: A transfer election allows an eligible taxpayer that qualifies for a clean energy tax
     credit but is not eligible to use elective pay to transfer all or a portion of the credit to a third-party buyer
     in exchange for cash. The buyer and seller would negotiate and agree to the terms and pricing.
• CHIPS – Elective Pay: The Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit, established by the Creating
 Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Act of 2022, incentivises the manufacture of
 semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment within the United States. The CHIPS
 credit is available to taxpayers that meet certain eligibility requirements. Eligible taxpayers can choose to
 receive the credit as an elective payment. Like elective pay for the IRA credits, an eligible taxpayer that
 earns the CHIPS advanced manufacturing credit must notify the IRS of its intent to claim the credit and
 file an annual tax return to claim elective pay for the full value of the credit. The IRS would then pay the
 eligible taxpayer the value of the credit, which can be refunded as an overpayment of tax if the payment
 of tax exceeds the amount properly due from the taxpayer.
Fact sheets, FAQs, and more information related to elective payment and a transfer election can be found
at IRS.gov/ElectivePay.
Completing pre-filing registration and filing a tax return are both required for elective payment elections
and transfer elections. This section of the User Guide and Instructions provides a brief overview of the
steps a taxpayer must take to monetize one or more of these credits with the elective payment election or
transfer of the credit.

Earn the Credit
An essential step in monetizing an IRA clean energy or CHIPS credit is earning the credit. That is, make
a tax credit investment or undertake tax credit production activities to earn a credit that qualifies for the
elective payment election under section 6417 or 48D(d) or can be transferred under section 6418. Credits
that may qualify for an elective payment election under section 6417 are "applicable credits" and those
that may qualify for a transfer election under section 6418 are "eligible credits." For more information
about the credits and how to earn them, see Appendix A – General Business Credit Resources.

Elective Payment or Transfer?
Determine whether the taxpayer can monetize the credits earned with an elective payment election or
by making an election to transfer the credit. Refer to the resources in Appendix B – IRA/CHIPS Elective
Payment and Transfer Resources for detailed information on those matters.

Elective Payment Election
A taxpayer that can and wants to make an elective payment election for one or more IRA clean energy
credits under section 6417 or the CHIPS credit under section 48D(d) must register the intention to make
an elective payment election and receive a registration number. Sections 1.48D-6T and 1.6417-5T.
A taxpayer making the elective payment election is treated as having made a payment against tax
imposed by Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code at the later of the due date of the tax return (without
extension), or when the return is timely filed (with extensions). See the resources in Appendix B – IRA/
CHIPS Elective Payment and Transfer Resources for more detailed information. A taxpayer that does not
file an annual income tax return (such as a government entity) will use Form 990-T, Exempt Organization
Business Income Tax Return (and proxy tax under section 6033(e)).
If the elective payment election amount, together with other tax payments and refundable credits,
exceeds the taxpayer’s income tax liability, the taxpayer is treated as having made an overpayment of tax,
which can be refunded or credited to estimated tax for the next tax year.

Credit Transfers
A taxpayer that can and wants to transfer IRA clean energy credits must register the intention to transfer
the credits and receive a registration number. Section 1.6418-4T. The taxpayer also must find an unrelated
transferee taxpayer who wishes to purchase the credit(s) for cash consideration. Section 6418. Proposed
regulations under section 6418 published in the Federal Register on June 21, 2023 provide proposed
rules related to the transfer of credits, such as providing the transferee taxpayer with documentation that
satisfies the Minimum Required Documentation under proposed section 1.6418-2(b)(5)(iv).

Pre-Filing Registration
Register the intention(s) to make an elective payment or a transfer election. Pre-filing registration is
required for an effective elective payment or transfer election. The election must be made on a timely filed
return. This User Guide and Instructions focuses on the pre-filing registration process. Detailed informa-
tion about the credits, how they are computed and reported is available in IRS forms, form instructions
and other resources. See Appendix B – IRA/CHIPS Elective Payment and Transfer Resources.
Complete and submit the pre-filing registration request no earlier than the beginning of the tax year in
which the taxpayer will earn the credit it wishes to monetize with an elective payment election or transfer
election. This is the earliest date for pre-filing registration because the facility/property that will generate
the credit (either as an investment or as a production facility) must have been placed in service before the
taxpayer can register it for an elective payment or transfer election.



                                                        4
IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration Tool User Guide and Instructions

Even though registration is not possible prior to the beginning of the tax year in which the credit will be
earned, the IRS recommends that taxpayers register as soon as reasonably practicable during the tax
year. The current recommendation is to submit the pre-filing registration at least 120 days prior to when
the organization or entity plans to file its tax return. This should allow time for IRS review, and for the
taxpayer to respond if the IRS requires additional information before issuing the registration numbers.
A registration submission can be amended after a prior submission has been processed by the IRS and
returned. See "Submission Status"
Other important considerations:
• The IRS intends to review and process registration submissions through the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing
 Registration tool in the order it receives them. A registrant cannot request expedited handling.
• If the registrant chooses to make additional pre-filing registration submissions for different facilities/
 properties, the registrant must wait until the most recent pre-filing registration submission is processed
 by the IRS and returned.
• IRS may consider a registrant’s tax period ending date when managing the pre-filing registration
 caseload.
• The IRS will work to issue a registration number even where the registration submission is made close
 in time before the registrant’s filing deadline. In such cases, the registrant should anticipate that the
 tax return on which the elective payment or transfer election is made may undergo heightened scrutiny
 to mitigate the risk of fraud and duplication that pre-filing registration is intended to address before a
 payment is issued.

Taxpayer Privacy and Public Disclosure
Information provided for Energy Credits Online – IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration is taxpayer information
protected from public disclosure under section 6103. Accordingly, information collected in the IRA/CHIPS
Pre-Filing Registration tool will not be shared with any person outside the IRS who is not authorized to
receive it (either by virtue of their status with respect to the taxpayer, or as the holder of a valid power of
attorney). See the Instructions for Form 990-T for information about public disclosure of Form 990-T when
filed by an organization exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3).

Reporting the Credit and Making the Election on a Tax Return
What Forms to File
Both the elective payment election and the transfer election are made on an annual tax return. A taxpayer
that has an annual tax return filing obligation will make the elective payment or transfer election on their
annual tax return.
Taxpayers that do not have an annual tax return filing obligation should refer to FAQs 20 through 23 at
Elective Pay and Transferability Frequently Asked Questions: Elective Pay for information about which
annual tax return form to use
To make an elective payment or credit transfer election, the annual tax return must include:
• All relevant source credit forms (the form used to compute and report the credit), showing computation
 of each credit. See Table 2 for a chart of the source credit forms used for each credit, and
• Form 3800, General Business Credits, showing how each business credit is carried to the annual tax
 return. Form 3800 will also associate each registration number with the credit computation to which it
 relates.

IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration Tool User Guide and Instructions

When to File
Both the elective payment election and the transfer election must be made on a timely filed return
(including extensions). This is the case for all taxpayers making an elective payment or transfer election. A
taxpayer with an annual filing requirement needing an extension of the time to file their annual return will
use existing forms and procedures to request an extension.
Form 8868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File an Exempt Organization Return has not
yet been revised to allow government entities (including tribal governments) to request an extension of
the time to file. Therefore, these government entities will, in the first year of implementation, receive an
automatic, paperless, 6-month extension for the due date of their tax return. It is unnecessary for them to
request an extension.
Refer to the instructions for the annual tax return on which the elective payment or transfer election will
be reported for information about the due date for the return. The regular due date for Form 990-T filed
by an exempt organization is the 15th day of the 5th month after the end of the tax year. For calendar year
taxpayers, that due date is May 15. The automatic paperless extension extends the due date by 6 months
(or for a calendar year taxpayer, extends the due date from May 15 to November 15). FAQs 20 through 23
at Elective Pay and Transferability Frequently Asked Questions: Elective Pay provide information about
the filing due date for taxpayers that do not have an annual return filing requirement.
The regular (not extended) filing date is the earliest date that the elective payment amount can be
disbursed. See FAQ 25 at Elective Pay and Transferability Frequently Asked Questions: Elective Pay.

Facility-By-Facility Reporting
Reporting on a facility/property basis will determine the number of registrations numbers the registrant will
need. Refer to the instructions for each source credit form. Pre-filing registration review will not consider
whether the facility-by-facility rules have been applied correctly. The registrant is responsible for knowing
how many registration numbers will be needed and how to describe the facility/property associated with
each registration number.
Note: In general, omission of a registration number from the taxpayer’s return for any reason will cause an
elective payment or transfer election to be treated as ineffective. This rule is applied on a facility/property
basis and credit-by-by credit basis.

Reporting the Elective Payment Amount
A taxpayer that has taxable income may apply some portion (or all) of the IRA/CHIPS credit(s) earned
as a non-refundable business credit. The amount of IRA/CHIPS credits remaining unused (which for
tax exempt taxpayers may be the entire credit amount) is reported on the "Elective payment election
amount" line on the tax return. For example, the elective payment election lines are found on the following
commonly used forms at the lines shown:
• Form 1120, Schedule J, Part II, line 22,
• Form 1120-S, line 24d,
• Form 1065, line 29,
• Form 990-T, Part III, line 6g.

Refer to the instructions for Form 3800, and the instructions for the appropriate tax return form for more
information about claiming general business credits (including clean energy credits) when making an
elective payment election.

IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration Tool User Guide and Instructions

Transfer Election
In addition to computing and reporting credits earned on the annual tax return, a taxpayer that is
monetizing one or more credits by transferring the credit to an unrelated transferee taxpayer must make
any necessary adjustments to credits reported on Form 3800 to account for credits used and credits
transferred. Refer to the instructions for Form 3800, and the instructions for the appropriate tax return
form for more information. See FAQs 4 and 5 at Elective Pay and Transferability Frequently Asked
Questions: Transferability for information about making and documenting a credit transfer.


Accessing the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration Tool

Registrant Authorization
An authorized user accessing Energy Credits Online for the first time on behalf of registrant must go
through the authorization steps shown in Figure 3 through Figure 6.
Note: On-screen options may vary from the illustrations shown in Figure 3 through Figure 6, depending
upon the registrant’s circumstances.

Employer Identification Number of the Business
Authorizing access for a registrant begins with its unique Employer Identification Number.
Caution: Every taxpayer that will use the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool MUST have its own employer
identification number unless it is an entity disregarded for income tax purposes. No registrant should ever use
the EIN of another taxpayer, even temporarily! See Publication 1635, Understanding Your EIN.

If the entity is a subsidiary of a business entity, or is a legal entity wholly owned by a business entity,
exempt organization, government entity or instrumentality of the government entity, the entity may need to
apply for an employer identification number if it doesn’t already have one.
If you are unsure whether your entity may already have a taxpayer identification number, you (or another
person authorized to act on behalf of the entity) can contact the IRS customer service telephone line for
the specific type of organization. See Telephone Assistance.
If the taxpayer needs to get an employer identification number, you should not continue the registrant
authorization process. Leave this page and go to Apply for an Employer Identification Number (EIN)
Online. Return to the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool only after the taxpayer has its EIN.
Enter the EIN of the taxpayer you wish to authorize. See Figure 3

One Registration Package Per Annual Accounting Period
Each registrant can have only one registration package for an annual accounting period (taxable year).
The registration package can relate to as many different elective payment or transfer elections as the
registrant is eligible to make for the annual accounting period.
 Once a registration package has been submitted for review, you will not be able to make any changes
 until review is completed and the registration submission is returned. Detailed information about the return
 of a registration submission after manual review is in the section of this User Guide and Instructions titled
"Submit for Review."

Never Use the EIN of Another Taxpayer, Even if it is a Closely Related Entity
Each taxpayer that will file a return to make an elective payment election or a transfer election must have
its own EIN. The IRS can process only one tax return (including superseding or amended returns) for each
EIN. Two separate taxpayers can never file their respective returns using the same EIN.
• The IRS may decline to issue a registration number if information included in the registration package
  indicates the registrant may be using another taxpayer’s EIN.
• For parent corporations and subsidiaries that are members of a consolidated group of corporations (as
  defined in regulations section 1.1502-1), see "Parent of a consolidated group of corporations."
• For owners of an entity that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes (such as a single member
  limited liability company), see information about disregarded entities in the section titled, "EIN and Name."

How Many Registration Numbers
The number of registration numbers a taxpayer needs to request through the pre-filing registration process
for facility-by-facility reporting will depend on how the credits must be computed and reported on the
source credit form (see Table 2) and Form 3800.
Before you begin to complete the registration package for a taxpayer, refer to the instructions for each
applicable source credit form and the instructions for Form 3800. The credit forms corresponding to each
credit for which an election may be registered through the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool are
shown in Table 2 – Source Credit Forms.

Error Review
The IRA/CHIPS Credits Pre-Filing Registration tool can identify certain errors immediately. When they occur,
a message will pop up describing the error(s) that must be corrected in order to proceed with registration.
Other general information errors may cause a submission to be returned without being transmitted for
review. This can happen if information you provided is inconsistent with information in our records. Please
review the information you entered and make any necessary corrections. If the information you provided
appears correct, resubmit the information.

Allow Time for Review
In general, you should submit your pre-filing registration no earlier than the beginning of the taxable period
in which you will earn the credit, but early enough to allow time for your registrations to be processed.
Currently, IRS recommends at least 120 days before the due date for the return on which the credits will
be reported.

Processing Steps
Clicking "Submit" after you have provided entries in all required data fields will cause the request for regis-
tration numbers to move to the review process.

Account Lock-Out While Review is "Awaiting Assignment" or "Under Review"
As soon as you click "Submit" on the registration package, your registrations will be closed for any additions,
updates or amendments until review is complete. However, you will be able to amend your previous submis-
sion when review is complete and your registration submission is returned. See "Amendments."
The IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool includes certain mandatory information fields to help you
prepare a complete registration package. However, the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool cannot
discern whether you intend to register one or more than one facility/property for a particular credit.
Similarly, the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool cannot recognize that you intended to register the
taxpayer for more credits than the credits already selected.

Resources Before You Register
The elective payment and transfer elections under the IRA and the elective payment election under the
CHIPS Act apply to specific general business credits. This User Guide and Instructions assumes famil-
iarity with general business credits such as:
• The difference between an investment tax credit and a production tax credit. The IRA/CHIPS credits
 include provisions relating to both types of credits. To register successfully, you need to know which
 credits the taxpayer can and wishes to monetize, especially when the taxpayer may have the option to
 monetize an investment tax credit or a production tax credit based upon a single investment/activity.
• How to earn each type of credit.
• How to compute and report each type of credit on the registrant’s tax return.

See Appendix A – General Business Credit Resources for a list of resources for credit-specific information.
Also assumed is a basic understanding of the credits to which elective payment and transfer elections
apply under the IRA and CHIPS Act and:
• Which return to use to make an elective payment or transfer election
• How to compute and report the credits on the tax return (credit-specific forms, Form 3800)
• How to effect the transfer of an IRA clean energy credit.

See Appendix B – IRA/CHIPS Elective Payment and Transfer Resources for resources on the specific
subject of monetization of certain credits through elective payment or transfer elections under IRA and
CHIPS legislation.

Summary
Submit the registration package as soon as reasonably practicable. If you anticipate the need to update or
amend a registration package, allow time for review and return of the submission before making updates
or amendments.
For example, a taxpayer may reasonably anticipate that it will earn production tax credits at certain facil-
ities already placed in service and has made certain other tax credit investments. If the taxpayer also
contemplates additional investments or may place an additional production facility in service later in the
year, that taxpayer could submit an early registration package (e.g., only a few months into the annual
tax period) for the projects/facilities already placed in service. After that registration package is fully
processed, that taxpayer could update its registrations with additional facilities or properties placed in
service nearer the end of its tax year.

IRA/CHIPS Credits Information
Overview
The pre-filing registration information collected by the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool falls into two
broad categories:
• General (entity) information
• Credit-specific information




                                                      18
IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration Tool User Guide and Instructions

General Information
All registrants must complete the general information section. General information includes:
• Tax period of the election
• EIN
• Information about subsidiaries included in a consolidated group of corporations
• Name
• Address
• Type of entity
• Bank account information
• Types of returns filed

Credit-Specific Information
Information required from each registrant will vary depending upon the number and type of credits the
registrant wishes to monetize with an elective payment or transfer election. The information you provide
will determine the credits and types of election available.
The IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool is dynamic. Depending upon information you provide, options
available to the registrant will be present. You generally will not see options not available to the registrant.

Common Questions
Certain questions are common to several credits, such as the physical location of a facility/property. This
User Guide and Instructions groups common questions together with an information bar showing the
credits to which the information relates. See "Questions Common to Multiple Credits."

Credit Specific Questions
Instructions for questions unique to a specific credit are grouped under the heading for that credit.
On the 2023 IRA/CHIPS Registration dashboard, select "Register" in the dashboard panel shown below.
Figure 12: Start Pre-Filing Registration




When you select "Register," the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool will take you to the first of four
Registration Information pages.

Date When the Registrant’s Accounting Period Ends
Figure 13: Tax Period of Your Election




Use the drop-down menu to select the ending month for the annual tax period in which each credit being
registered is earned. This should match the fiscal year ending date shown on the registrant’s last filed
return. If new to filing an annual tax return, this date should be the same as the fiscal year end month
used on the first annual tax return. For example, if a registrant keeps its books and records on a non-cal-
endar year that ends on June 30 and will use that date as the fiscal year end on its first annual tax return,
select "June" from the drop-down menu. Use the drop-down menu to identify the year in which the
annual accounting period ends for the taxable period for which the registrant wishes to make an elective
payment or transfer election.
If the registrant changes its fiscal year end (such as by filing a short-year return), you must amend the
registration before the registrant files its return. See "Amendments."
More information on Accounting Periods can be found in Publication 538, Accounting Periods and
Methods.

Enter the EIN and the name of the taxpayer that is registering facilities for which it will make an elective
payment or transfer election on its annual tax return.
When the registrant is the parent of a consolidated group of corporations, the parent’s EIN and name will be
entered in these fields. Additional information about subsidiaries is captured as credit-specific information.
When the business that earns the credit is a single member limited liability company (LLC) or other entity
that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes, the information entered in these fields will depend upon
the ownership of the entity for federal income tax purposes. See Table 3 – Disregarded Entities

Parent of a Consolidated Group of Corporations
Figure 15: Parent of a Consolidated Group




Answer, "Yes," to the question if the entity is:
• A corporation (including an Alaska Native Corporation) that files Form 1120 on a consolidated basis for
 itself and one or more subsidiary corporations.
• A nonprofit corporation exempt under section 501(c)(3) that files Form 990-T on a consolidated basis
 with one or more title-holding companies exempt under section 501(c)(2) and one or more credits for
 which it wishes to make an elective payment election will be earned by a title-holding company.
The parent of a consolidated group of corporations will register on behalf of itself and will act as agent for
subsidiaries included in the group. See regulations section 1.1502-77. When entering credit-specific infor-
mation, the parent corporation will provide the subsidiary name and EIN for each facility or property being
registered that is owned by the subsidiary.
Note: See information for an Alaska Native Corporation that is the parent of a consolidated group of
corporations that includes subsidiaries that are not Alaska Native Corporations in the description of regis-
trant types below Figure 16.

Registrant Type
The Registrant Type you select determines whether the taxpayer can register to make an elective payment
or transfer election (or whether either option may be available for certain credits). See the brief descrip-
tions of the registrant types below.
Figure 16: Registrant Type




• Organization exempt from the tax imposed by subtitle A by reason of section 501(a) of the Code.

 Note: When registrant type is "Alaska Native Corporation," an additional question field will appear if
 the registrant has indicated above that it is the parent of a consolidated group of corporations. The
 additional field will ask whether the consolidated group includes any subsidiaries which are not Alaska
 Native Corporations. A "yes" response here will allow the corporate parent to register for transfer
 elections for its non-Alaska Native Corporation subsidiaries.

 Act, P.L. 108-447 (16 U.S.C. 831 – 831ee).
• Rural electric cooperative. Any corporation operating on a cooperative basis which is engaged in
 furnishing electric energy to persons in rural areas.
 Note: For purposes of pre-filing registration, a rural electric cooperative described in section 501(c)(12)
 should select the above-described registrant type for organizations exempt under section 501(a).

• Partnership. A limited partnership, syndicate, group, pool, joint venture, or other unincorporated
 organization, through or by which any business, financial operation, or venture is carried on, that isn't,
 within the meaning of regulations under section 7701, a corporation, trust, estate, or sole proprietorship,
 and files a Form 1065.
• S Corporation. A corporation within the meaning of Section 1361(a) that elects to pass corporate

 which is subject to federal income tax under the provisions of subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code.
• Real Estate Investment Trust. A legal entity separate from its owners, made up of individuals, groups, or
 other corporations, that has the power to conduct business and to own property, assets, and liabilities.
• Sole Proprietorship. Business owned by an individual directly or through an entity, such as a grantor
 trust or single member limited liability company, that is not taxed as a separate entity but is in substance
 disregarded for federal income tax purposes.
 Note: This registrant type applies only if the qualifying property or facility is owned by an individual
 directly (and not indirectly through ownership of an interest in a separate business entity such as a
 corporation, partnership, or a limited liability company, treated as a partnership or corporation for federal
 income tax purposes).

• Trust. Any arrangement for which the purpose is to vest trustees responsibility for the protection and
 conservation of property for beneficiaries, and that is not properly classified as a grantor trust, sole
 proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or does not receive special treatment under the Code (such as, a

CHIPS Credit
The CHIPS credit is not a clean energy credit. However, section 48D(d) includes an elective payment
election. A taxpayer that wishes to monetize the CHIPS credit with an elective payment must register the
intention to do so.
The CHIPS credit is subject to a unique qualification that does not apply to the IRA Credits. If you choose
the section 48D Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit, additional fields will open where you must
attest that the registrant is an eligible taxpayer before you can continue. See Figure 23 – CHIPS Credit

Credit Summary
Before moving to the Facility/Property Information module, you will have an opportunity to view a
summary of the credit selections. See, Figure 24 – Credit Selection Review, which shows an example
in which the registrant selected three credits (section 48D, CHIPS Credit; section 30C, Alternative Fuel
Refueling Property Credit; and section 45, Renewable Electricity Production Credit).
Figure 24: Credit Selection Review (example)




Facility/Property Information
General Principles
The information collected for each credit is based on the requirements to qualify for the credit.

Registration Not a Determination of the Amount or Validity of a Credit
The purpose of pre-filing registration is to "[prevent] duplication, fraud, improper payments, or excessive
payments" as described in sections 48D(d)(2)(E), 6417(d)(5) and 6418(g)(1).
Issuance of a registration number does not mean that the registrant has been determined to qualify for a
credit of any specific amount. In addition to registering the intent to monetize one of the credits listed in
Figure 21 or Figure 22, each taxpayer must meet other requirements to make a valid election, including
reporting the credit on the applicable source credit form (see Table 2 – Source Credit Forms), completing
Form 3800 and attaching those forms to a timely filed tax return.


                                                      31
IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration Tool User Guide and Instructions

Data Entry
The registrant will need a separate pre-filing registration number for each facility/property. The number
of registration numbers will depend upon the number of source credit forms necessary to compute and
report the credit. See "How Many Registration Numbers?" Facility/property information can be added for
certain credits by way of a spreadsheet file (bulk upload) or manually (one facility/property at a time). Bulk
upload offers some convenience. However, for the current version of the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registra-
tion tool, bulk upload has limitations that must be considered. They are described in the "Bulk Upload"
section.

Manual Entry
Entries for each credit can be made manually by entering facility/property information required for a
complete submission field by field.
The IRS anticipates that manual entry will be adequate for the following credits:
• Section 45Q, Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit
• Section 45U, Zero Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit
• Section 45V, Clean Hydrogen Production Credit
• Section 45X, Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit
• Section 48C, Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit
• Section 48D, CHIPS Advanced Manufacturing Credit

When manual data entry is the only option, the facility/property information data collection starting point
will appear as in Figure 25.
Figure 25: Manual entry (only) of facility/property




Selecting "ADD FACILITY/PROPERTY" will open the input page(s) for the credit. The specific information
required for each credit is described below.

IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration Tool User Guide and Instructions

Bulk Upload
In anticipation that some credits may require registration of a substantial number of facilities/properties,
facility/property information for the following credits can be input into a spreadsheet template for upload
in a single step:
• Section 30C, Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit
• Section 45, Renewable Electricity Production Credit
• Section 45W, Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit
• Section 48, Energy Credit

When bulk upload and manual entry are available options, the facility/property information data collec-
tion starting point will appear as in Figure 26, with options to select "BULK UPLOAD," or manual "ADD
FACILITY/PROPERTY."

Download the facility template. Enter the information required in the spreadsheet fields. Save (and retain)
the file and then upload it by following the instructions shown in Figure 27.
After the spreadsheet is uploaded, it will be parsed and evaluated for omissions and errors in formatting.
Errors identified in the bulk download format review will be identified by spreadsheet row and column
heading, as shown in Figure 28.

Bulk Download Format Review
Figure 28: Bulk upload errors (example)




When errors are identified at this step, you must return to the spreadsheet file saved to your computer.
Open the spreadsheet file and correct the errors identified. Then, you must upload the corrected file using
the upload feature below the roster of errors. See Figure 29.

The corrected file will replace the original upload, as well as any facilities/properties that may have been
added manually. Therefore, if you must re-upload a spreadsheet file, you must include any manually
added facilities/properties for them to remain in the registration submission. See Figure 30.
Figure 30: Bulk upload overwrite warning




Entries from a spreadsheet that has passed data validation (parsing) will populate the fields in the IRA/
CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool. Once this occurs, you can edit or update information for each facility/
property by expanding the facility/property panel, as shown in Figure 31 and selecting the "edit" function.

Supporting Documents
See information for each credit for information about supporting documents appropriate for each credit.
If you add each facility/property manually, the document upload step will occur as a late step in the data
entry process. If you use the bulk upload option, you will add documents after the template-formatted
data has populated the fields in the tool. At this time, the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool does not
support addition of supporting documents within the bulk upload process.
To add supporting documents for each facility/property, expand the facility/property panel as shown in
Figure 31.
Documents can be added to an amended submission. Documents included in a registration submitted for
review cannot later be removed.

Questions/Data Common to Multiple Credits
This section of the User Guide and Instructions describes the following questions common to multiple
credits:
• Choice of Election
• Subsidiary in a Consolidated Group of Corporations
• Important Dates

 ◦   Date Construction Began
 ◦   Date Placed in Service
• Facility/Property Location
• Joint Ownership
• Source of Funds
• Additional Information

Choice of Election
Pre-filing registration is required for taxpayers who wish to monetize an applicable or eligible credit under
section 6417 (elective payment election for applicable credits), 6418 (transfer election for eligible credits)
or section 48D(d) (elective payment for a CHIPS credit). In most instances, a registrant’s option to make
an elective payment or a transfer election will be determined by entity type. Organizations and entities
defined as "applicable entities" under section 6417 are limited to making an elective payment election. A
transfer election is similarly restricted to taxpayers that are not "applicable entities" under section 6417. In
limited circumstances, a registrant will need to indicate which election it wishes to make, because it can
choose either, but not both, for a specific property/facility. When a registrant must choose an election, the
field shown in Figure 32, will appear.
Figure 32: Choice of Election




Business Taxpayers
Certain taxpayers have the option to make either an elective payment or transfer election with respect to
the following credits:
• Section 45Q, Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit,
• Section 45V, Production of Clean Hydrogen Credit,
• Section 45X, Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit.

Therefore, the selection field shown in Figure 32 will appear for the registrant types shown in Table 1 as
eligible to make an elective payment or transfer election.

IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration Tool User Guide and Instructions

Alaska Native Corporations
An Alaska Native Corporation is an "applicable entity" under section 6417. Therefore, an Alaska Native
Corporation can make an elective payment election but cannot elect to transfer credits. However, an
Alaska Native Corporation also can be the parent of a consolidated group of corporations that includes
subsidiaries that are not applicable entities. Those subsidiaries can potentially earn IRA clean energy
credits that are eligible for a transfer election.
To accommodate this unique combination of factors, a registrant that:
• identifies as an Alaska Native Corporation in the Registrant Type field (see Figure 16 – Registrant Type),
 and
• answers "Yes," that it is the Parent of a consolidated group of corporations (see Figure 15 – Parent of a
 Consolidated Group),
will see the Choice of Election question for every credit for which a transfer election could be made by a C
corporation that is not an Alaska Native Corporation.
An Alaska Native Corporation in this situation must carefully select the appropriate choice of election for
each property or facility. An error in the choice of election will delay processing of the registration request.

Subsidiary Information
A question common to every credit (except the section 45W clean commercial vehicle credit) is whether
the property or facility is owned by a subsidiary in a consolidated group of corporations.
Figure 33: Subsidiary




Answering "Yes," will cause additional fields to open to capture the name and EIN of the subsidiary.

This information is necessary for every credit other than the section 45W credit because the subsidiary
owner of a facility or property is a legal entity separate from the parent corporation and registering as
agent for the subsidiary. Collecting information about the subsidiary owner of the facility/property allows
the registration to be associated both with the subsidiary (as owner) and the parent (as the entity filing the
return where the credit is reported).
If a subsidiary later leaves the consolidated group, the former parent and the subsidiary should amend the
registration to update the association of the registration number for purposes of filing of the annual return
where the credit will be computed and reported. See "Amendments."

Important Dates
Refer to the instructions for the source credit form for each credit. The range of dates that will affect the
ability to earn a specific credit will be determined by the applicable Code provision.

Date Placed in Service
Before a facility/property can be registered to make an elective payment or transfer election for a partic-
ular property or facility, that property or facility must have been placed in service no later than the date
the registration is submitted. You cannot request a registration number for a facility that has not yet been
placed in service.

Facility/Property Location
Enter information that identifies the physical location of the investment credit or production credit facility
or property. The entry fields shown in Figure 36 are dynamic.
In recognition that not all facilities or properties will have a street address, only the State, County, latitude
and longitude fields are required for the credits to which these fields apply. However, if a street address is
entered, the city and ZIP Code fields will become required fields.
 Unless the facility or property is physically located at the address entered in the General Information
"Registrant address" field shown in Figure 17, do not enter that address here.
If the facility/property does not have a street address, identify the State and County where the facility/
property is physically located, and provide the latitude and longitude coordinates.
Latitude and longitude coordinates are required fields. The entry should be in decimal format with 6 digits
to the right of the decimal point, with a minus sign (-) for latitudes south of the equator and longitudes
west of the prime meridian. The entry field will not accept an entry formatted as degrees, minutes and
seconds. The entry field also will not accept alphabetical characters for north, south, east or west.
For example, the White House, located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC is located at
latitude 38.897957 and longitude -77.036560.
Six digits of precision for latitude and longitude identifies a point on the globe within a few inches. This is
a smaller area than most facilities/properties you would register through the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Regis-
tration tool. When a facility/property covers an area larger than the point identified with coordinates at this
level of precision, simply select a single point for the entry. Be sure to use the same coordinates on the
source credit form attached to the tax return.
You may (but are not required to) provide additional coordinates in the "Additional information" field to
indicate the boundaries of a large installation.
Note: The number of registration numbers necessary to make an elective payment or transfer election
for a large or multi-component installation will be determined by the way the taxpayer will compute and
report the credit on its tax return. Please refer to the instructions for each source credit form before you
complete the registration submission so that you can determine how many registration numbers the regis-
trant will need to complete its tax return.

Joint Ownership
For certain production tax credits, the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool asks about percentage
ownership. This question is asking about direct fractional ownership as joint tenants or tenants in
common. The question does not refer to a property/facility owned by several persons through their inter-
ests in a partnership, corporation, limited liability company or other entity.
If the registrant answers "Yes," an additional field opens to capture the registrant’s percentage ownership
interest, stated as a percentage to precision of two decimal places, as shown in Figure 37.

When a tax credit investment property is acquired with restricted grant funds or a forgivable loan, use of
those funds to acquire the property may affect how the elective payment election amount is computed.
See Elective Pay and Transferability Frequently Asked Questions: Elective Pay, FAQ #41.
For purposes of the elective payment election, "restricted grant funds" refers to a grant for the specific
purpose of purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, erecting, or otherwise acquiring an investment credit
property. In general, grant funds will be restricted if the donor, in writing, imposes a restriction on the use
of such funds specifically for the purpose of purchasing, constructing, reconstructing, erecting, or other-
wise acquiring an investment credit property.

Additional Information
Every credit includes an unformatted "Additional Information" text field. This field allows collection of
any additional information the registrant may wish to provide to identify a specific property or facility, or
that the IRS may determine is needed between updates of the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool.
Currently, this field is optional. Some potential uses for this could include (for example):
• Longitude and latitude coordinates of a large solar or wind farm installation that doesn’t have a street
 address at points other than the longitude and latitude provided for in the field shown in Figure 36.
• A brief description of the registrant’s credit-earning activities when the registrant is a newly formed entity
 with no filing history.

Supporting Documents
Every credit allows attachment of supporting documentation. The types of documents appropriate to each
type of credit are described in the credit-specific information for each credit.
See "Bulk Upload," for instructions for adding supporting documentation when facility/property informa-
tion is provided through a bulk upload template.
When facility/property information is added manually, supporting documentation is added as the last step
in completing the information for a facility/property.

Figure 40: Supporting documents – manual entry (step 2)




The documentation to support pre-filing registration will vary by the type of credit. See the credit-specific
information for each credit below for a description of the types of documents that will facilitate processing
of the pre-filing registration.
Note: Supporting documents will usually be relatively short documents, such as permits, title documents,
sales documents (showing the name of the registrant, date of purchase and identifying information such
as serial numbers). Do not attach detailed project plans or contractual agreements. If detailed project
plans or contractual agreements are the best support that the taxpayer is engaging in activities or making
tax credit investments that qualify the registrant to claim a credit, the registrant should submit an extract
of the document showing the name of the taxpayer, date of purchase and identifying information such as
serial numbers, rather than the entire document.
If necessary, you will have an opportunity to augment supporting documentation.

Credit-Specific Information
Section 30C, Alternative Fuel Refueling Property
Section 30C provides for an investment tax credit for alternative fuel refueling property placed in service
in a population census tract that is a low-income community for purposes of the New Markets Tax Credit
(see section 45D) or in a population census tract that is not an urban area.

IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration Tool User Guide and Instructions

Census Tract
The IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool uses the 11-digit format for population census tract numbers
without a decimal separator. See Instructions for Form 8911, Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property
Credit for information about determining whether your facility/property is in a qualifying population census
tract.

Fuel Type
The Instructions for Form 8911 include descriptions of the types of refueling properties that qualify for the
section 30C credit.

Supporting Documents
The following is a non-exhaustive list of documents that may support the registration of a facility/property
for the section 30C credit:
• A construction permit that clearly ties the facility/property to its physical location.
• Equipment Purchase documentation that shows the taxpayer as the buyer, identifies the seller, and
 specifically identifies the purchased property.
• A permit issued by a government authority with jurisdiction over operation of alternative fuel refueling
 properties in the community where the facility/property is located.

Section 45, Renewable Electricity Production Credit
Attestation
The investment in a facility or property that could generate a section 45 renewable electricity produc-
tion credit may also qualify for a section 48, energy credit, which is an investment tax credit. However, a
taxpayer cannot claim both credits with respect to the same facility or property. Therefore, the IRA/CHIPS
Pre-Filing Registration tool requires an attestation that the taxpayer has not claimed a section 48 credit for
this facility for any prior tax period.
Figure 41: Section 45: Attestation




The registrant must be able to make the attestation shown in Figure 41 to continue to the other entry
fields for the section 45 credit.

Type of Facility/Property

Section 45U, Zero Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit
Note: Section 45U, Zero Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit applies to electricity produced and
sold after December 31, 2023, in taxable years beginning after such date. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022,
section 13105(c).
Caution: Do not register a facility/property for this credit for an annual accounting period beginning in
2023 even if electricity was produced in that annual accounting period after December 31, 2023.

No Credit-Specific Questions
The IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool does not include questions specific to this credit. An explana-
tion of the information requested can be found above in the section on "Questions Common to Multiple
Credits."

description of the production facility.

Supporting Documents
The following is a list of supporting documentation the IRS expects a taxpayer earning this credit will
naturally have or acquire:
• Operating permit
• Commissioning report

Section 45W, Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit
The section 45W credit for each vehicle is computed on a separate Schedule A (Form 8936), Clean Vehicle
Credit Amount and reported on Form 8936, Clean Vehicle Credits. Therefore, each vehicle requires its own
registration number. Understanding that some registrants may intend to monetize the credit for fleets of
vehicles, the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool includes the option to use a spreadsheet template to
capture information for all vehicles and use a bulk upload process.
Use the bulk data upload template, which is formatted with drop down menus and other data-validation
capabilities to ensure that the uploaded data will be complete and in the correct format.

Vehicle Information
The IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool asks for the Vehicle Identification Number and other
credit-specific information about the vehicle that relates to qualification of the vehicle for the credit.
Note: To qualify for the section 45W credit, a vehicle that is classified as "mobile machinery" must be
of the type that has a 17-alpha-numeric character vehicle identification number (VIN) assigned by the
qualified manufacturer in accordance with requirements of Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR),
Subtitle B, Chapter V, Part 565 and such VIN is reported by the qualified manufacturer as required in
Revenue Procedure 2022-42 as amended by Revenue Procedure 2023-33.

Supporting Documents
• Certificate of title showing ownership of the vehicle/machinery (including a certificate of title indicating a
 lien held by a financial institution or other lender)

 authority.

Section 45X, Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit
Attestation
Section 45X(c)(1)(B) excludes from the definition "eligible component," "any property which is produced
at a facility if the basis of any property which is part of such facility is taken into account for purposes of
the credit allowed under section 48C after the date of the enactment of this section." Therefore, pre-filing
registration for a section 45X credit requires an attestation that a section 48C, Qualifying Advanced Energy
Project Credit will not be claimed for this property/facility for the current or any prior taxable period.
Figure 46: Section 45X Attestation




Eligible Components
The section 45X credit applies to production of eligible components, as that term is defined in section 45X
and other guidance. A facility/property may produce more than one type of eligible component. Therefore,
you can select as many eligible components listed under the Facility/Property Information as applicable. If
you need to describe eligible components not specifically identified in the drop-down list, select "Other."
A text box will open below the list where a description of the item(s) can be entered. See Figure 47.

The IRA/CHIPS Credit Registration home page will show your registrations as "SUBMITTED."

Lock-Out For Revisions During Review
As soon as your registrations are successfully submitted, the tool will lock-out your ability to make any
changes to your registrations. As described below, you can (and should) monitor the status of the registra-
tions while they are under review.

Monitor the Status of Your Registrations
After you submit a registration package, you can monitor its status in the "Your Registrations" site.
If you opt to receive email notifications you will receive an email each time the Submission Status changes.
Email notices are sent automatically. A single notification is sent for each change in Submission Status.
The system will not issue reminder notifications. In addition, you will not receive paper correspondence
from the IRS about any changes in Submission Status.
You are not required to opt to receive email notifications. However, you are responsible to know the status
of the registrations.

Returned
When review is complete, the Submission Status will appear either as
• "Returned – Open," or
• "Returned – Closed"

The banner text at the top of the Your Registrations page will provide additional information.

Returned – Closed
Submission Status, "Returned – Closed" can appear under either of the following circumstances:
 1. Review of the registration is complete, and each registration number requested has been issued.
   Registration Information will display the issued registration numbers in the column, "Registration #."
   "Facility/Property Status" will show as "Issued" and no reviewer comments will be provided. See Figure 56

Figure 56: Returned Closed




A banner will appear at the top of the page that explains the status of the registration submission. The
registrations can now be amended.
 2. Review of the registration submission is complete, fewer than all registration numbers requested were
   issued, and no additional information was provided within 35 days of the date provided in the reviewer
   comments. See Figure 57.

Any registration numbers issued will be shown in the "Registration #" column. Registration numbers not
issued will show as "Pending." A "View Comments" link will describe issues identified by the reviewer that
precluded issuance of a registration number.

Figure 57: Returned Closed – Response Period Expired




You may still respond to reviewer comments; however, the response will be treated as a new submission
and worked in the order it was received.
When the Submission Status is "Returned – Closed," any change submitted will be a new submission.
Upon submission of the change, Submission Status will revert to "Awaiting Assignment," to signify that a
new submission has been started.

Returned – Open
Submission Status, "Returned – Open" appears when fewer than all (or no) registration numbers
requested were issued, and you have 35 days from the date the submission was returned to provide
additional information or correct errors that were the basis for non-issuance of one or more registration
numbers.
If no registration numbers were issued and the reason for non-issuance relates to an entity-level issue that
prevents the registrant from qualifying for any elective payment or transfer election, information will be
provided in the comments area below Submission Status. When some, but not all registration numbers
are issued, and the basis for non-issuance relates to the credit or a specific facility/property, the reviewer’s
comment will be associated with the facility/property. Under Registration Information click on the hyperlink
labeled, "View Comments" to see an explanation for why a specific registration number was not issued.

IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration Tool User Guide and Instructions

 If you respond within 35 days from when the registration was returned, the submission of the response
 will return the Submission Status to "Under Review," which signifies that the submission retained its place
 in line for review. Selecting "Submit" will again lock the registrations and return Submission Status to
"Under Review." Therefore, you should submit responses only after every comment has been addressed.

Note: At this time, the review status of a facility/property will not be indicated on the roster of facilities/
properties. You will need to note which facilities/properties require a response before you return to edit
those registrations.

Registration Numbers
Each registration number is unique and has been assigned to a specific
• Election type,
• Credit,
• Facility/Property
• Tax period of the election
• Owner of the facility/property.

Any changes to the information provided in the registration affecting any of these elements of the registra-
tion number will necessitate an amendment to the registration. See "Amendments."
For example, if you indicated the registrant’s intention to make an elective payment for a section 45Q
credit and later decide to transfer it, you must amend the registration. The elective payment registration
number cannot be used to make a transfer election on the registrant’s tax return.
Similarly, if the registrant initially elects to monetize an investment tax credit (that could also be taken as a
production tax credit), and later decides to claim the production tax credit, you must amend the registra-
tion. The registration number for the investment tax credit cannot be used for the corresponding produc-
tion credit.
See the instructions and forms for the applicable source credit forms (see Table 2) and Form 3800 to learn
where registration numbers must be included on the registrant’s return (and associated forms).
If the taxpayer chooses a transfer election, the taxpayer must provide the registration number associated
with the property/facility and credit to be transferred to the transferee who purchased the credit.
Before the registrant files the tax return on which it will make an elective payment or transfer election, you
must return to the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool to view and copy the registration numbers.

Amendments
One Registration Per Annual Accounting Period
The registrant can have only one registration each annual accounting period. The registration package can
be amended in various ways, but it remains the one registration package for the annual accounting period.

Amendments Allowed for Registrations Returned After Review
As noted above, a registration submitted for review cannot be changed until it is returned with registra-
tion numbers or comments that explain why registration numbers were not issued. Once the registration
submission is returned, you can revise the registration.

When to Amend
The following are situations currently envisioned as requiring amendment to a registration:

Addition of a Facility/Property
Serial Submissions
The registrant can submit registrations for review in series. For example, if early in the registrant’s
accounting period you know that the registrant will need registration numbers for tax credit investments
placed in service early in the year or the registrant will undertake production tax credit projects, you can
submit those facilities/properties for registration as soon as you have the information needed to submit



                                                        62
IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration Tool User Guide and Instructions

the registration. If the registrant later adds more tax credit investments or undertakes new production
activities that need a separate registration number, you can submit those new facilities/properties later in
the year.
The initial submission will create the registration for that accounting period. Each subsequent submission
will amend the initial submission.
Note: The bulk upload process for data entry (see Bulk upload, earlier) is available only for the initial
submission. At this time, facility/property amendments or additions after the initial submission must be
input manually. This is to protect information and to avoid inadvertent deletion or revisions after the initial
submission.

Change of Election
As noted above, registration numbers are unique and reflect the type of election, the annual accounting
period in which the election will be made, the specific credit and facility/property. If the taxpayer can
make either election (elective pay or transfer), the registrant could decide to change the election type after
obtaining a particular type of registration number. In that case, you must amend the registration to:
• Cancel the initial registration type, and
• Obtain a registration number for the other type of election.

Registration for the different election type on an amended submission should include the originally issued
registration number in the "Additional information" field.

Addition of a Subsidiary to a Consolidated Group of Corporations
If the registrant is the parent corporation of a consolidated group, and it acquires a subsidiary that has
IRA Clean Energy credits or a CHIPS credit that will be monetized with an elective payment or transfer
election on the registrant’s consolidated return, each facility/property owned by the subsidiary must be
added to the parent corporation’s registration submission. Even if the subsidiary previously registered to
monetize the credits (either on its own or as a subsidiary in another consolidated group), a change to the
tax return on which the elective payment or transfer election will be made means that the registration must
be amended to add each facility/property owned by the subsidiary that will be included on the annual tax
return of the parent corporation.
Failure to add each facility/property owned by a subsidiary to the parent corporation’s registrations will
cause any attempted elective payment or transfer election to become ineffective, even if that subsidiary’s
facilities/properties were previously registered. The registration numbers must be associated with the EIN
of the return on which the election will be made.
Note: If the facility/property owned by the subsidiary already has a registration number, that information
should be provided in the "Additional information" field of the registration submitted by the new parent
corporation. So long as information about the facility/property is consistent with information provided in
connection with the earlier registration, IRS review and reissuance of a registration number for that facility/
property may be streamlined.

Removal of a Facility/Property
A registrant may have reason to remove a facility/property from its registrations, if, for example, there is
a sale or disposition of any facility/property. In that case, the registrant should provide the registration
number to the new owner and amend the registration to remove the facility/property from "Your Regis-
trations." The new owner will need to submit their own registration package. However, knowing that the
facility/property underwent a prior review may facilitate IRS review if the facility/property is registered by
the new owner.


                                                       63
IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration Tool User Guide and Instructions

Note: A new owner cannot use the registration number issued to another registrant. Providing the deleted
registration number as additional information for their own submission serves simply to inform the IRS
that the facility/property was previously reviewed and a registration number was issued.

Change of Facility/Property Information
If circumstances change such that a response previously provided in the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Regis-
tration tool would change, you should return to the IRA/CHIPS Pre-Filing Registration tool as soon as
practicable to update the information in the registration and submit it for review. If the change means that
the taxpayer will no longer qualify to monetize the credit in the manner previously indicated, the registra-
tion number will be removed. A comment will be attached to the registration explaining the change. If the
change does not affect qualification to monetize the credit, the registration will be returned as a closed
case and the registration number will remain in effect.
