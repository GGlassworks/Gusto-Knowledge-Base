                        BOLT ADJUSTMENT FOR PROPER ENGAGING WITH THE STRIKE
If necessary, the retractable bolt can be adjusted. The centerline of the roller at the top of the retractable bolt should enter the
strike a minimum of 1/8”. The maximum upward adjustment is 3/4” when measuring from the top of the handle tubing to the top
of the bolt.

To adjust the retractable bolt

“A” remove the flat head screw at the top of the panic handle but do not remove the slotted head screw

“B” rotate the retractable bolt 360 degrees in either direction to obtain the desired height adjustment. Rotate bolt to align interior
threaded hole with countersunk hole in tubing.

“C” Replace flat head screw.
Note: if flat head screw is not securely replaced, the retractable bolt will randomly rotate, which will cause the bolt to improperly engage the strike.

                ADJUSTMENT OF DOOR STOP/STRIKE DOOR STOP WITH ELECTRICAL STRIKE
After door has been installed & comes to rest on door stop rubber
the retractable bolt should automatically move upward into the
strike as illustrated. The distance from the face of glass (F.O.G.) to
center of handle should be 2”

If retractable bolt is not fully engaging with the strike,
the door stops need to be moved in

if the door is rattling or the retractable bolt is lose inside the strike
door stops should be moved out.

Adjustment :

To adjust the door stop simply remove the rubber end piece & you
will see an opening for a 1/4” allen wrench. Insert the wrench &
rotate in or out as needed

One complete turn will be equal to 1/16” of adjustment .

Your PRL panic handle under normal operation conditions should not require any maintenance other than cleaning the bars.

However, if you experience any difficulty with the operation of the system, do not attempt to repair the system yourself.

It is highly recommended to contact the original installer or contact PRL GLASS @ 800-433-7044

                MAINTENANCE OF STAINLESS STEEL FINISHES ON HANDLE




Polished #8 & brushed # 4 finishes on stainless steel (alloy 304) are one of the
most durable & easiest finishes to maintain.
PRL GLASS recommends a soft clean cloth & a foam type spray glass cleaner on
the soft cloth & rub the stainless steel part directionally parallel to its length.
This method applies to both polished & brushed finishes.


Note: Do not use circular motions when cleaning stainless steel, especially on
polished finishes, as doing so leaves fine polish lines on the surface. Do not use
steel wool to clean brushed stainless steel. Steel wool leaves small pieces of
wool in the brushed grooves. These pieces of wool will rust, thus the impression
that the stainless steel is rusting, which is impossible.

                     MAINTENANCE OF BRASS BRONZE FINISHES ON HANDLE




Polished & brushed finishes applied to brass & bronze alloys must be routinely maintained to retain the
desired appearance. The darkening or black spotting on the brass & bronze surfaces is simply oxidation tak-
ing place. If left untreated brass & bronze alloys will eventually turn entirely, but unevenly dark.
This dark oxidized state is the natural color of all copper alloys, which brass & bronze are included.


Maintenance of brass/bronze must be done on a routinely timely basis as needed. Depending on use &
abuse, location, weather conditions or exposure to marine air, will determine the frequency that the finish
will need attention.


Polished finishes (brass/bronze): polished brass is a simple process if done routinely.
PRL GLASS recommends “brasso metal polish” or equal which is applied much the same as car wax. Brass &
bronze are directionally polished @ the factory parallel to the length of the part. Apply the brass polish
with a soft clean cloth parallel to the length of the part with medium pressure. Allow the polish to dry &
buff with a soft clean cloth. Repeat if necessary.
Note: when polishing brass or bronze do not use a circular motion as it will leave a circular pattern in the
finish. PRL GLASS also suggests after re-polishing the brass or bronze, that a coat of “Harley’s pure carnuba
wax” be applied to help maintain the finish.
Brushed/Satin finishes (brass/bronze): Maintenance of brushed or satin brass/bronze finishes is done us-
ing an entirely different method than that of a polished finished. PRL GLASS recommends a “Scotch brite”
pad over the brass or bronze in the same direction as the existing finish (parallel to the length) will remove
the oxidation from the surface. Medium pressure in long easy strokes should be all that is necessary.
Note: do not use brass polish to clean brushed/satin finishes. The polish will load up the groves in the
brushed / satin finish making a simple clean job a lengthy one.

                    MAINTENANCE OF US10B STATUARY BRONZE ON HANDLE




The US10B is a process to age the brass/bronze surface to simulate the nature aging process.
The US10B will be specified in either oil rubbed or clear baked enamel to preserve the finish.


1.– Oil rubbed: after the aging process is complete, a hand applied lemon oil is rubbed onto the surface.
The oil rubbed process allows the brass to continue to darken. On a frequent basis lemon oil should be re-
applied with a soft clean cloth in the field. The frequency will determined when the metal surface appears
dull & dry.


2.– Clear baked enamel: after the aging process is complete a clear baked enamel is applied to the brass
surface to delay further darkening (aging). Clear baked enamel should be cleaned with a soft cotton cloth
& a spray type glass cleaner. Do not soak the brass finish.


Note: the clear baked enamel finish will delay aging but not eliminate the possibility. The baked enamel
finish is susceptible to abrasion & scratching. Clear baked enamel carries no warranty & it will eventually
have to be re-done.
PRL GLASS recommends that a professional brass maintenance company be hired to do any of the field
restorations.


We do not recommend any protective lacquering of brass & bronze door hardware. Lacquer wears off in
certain use areas leaving a non-uniform or spotty finish.
The areas most affected are those where the handles contact the metal. Furthermore, rings worn on the
fingers can cause the lacquer to be removed thus exposing the scratches of the lacquer.
However, protective lacquer will delay aging but not eliminate & will eventually have to be re-done.
If proper maintenance is followed, you will be able to elongate the time between re-finishing.
We recommend that a professional brass maintenance company be hired
to do any of the field restorations.
