EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The 2022–2023 AASA Superintendent Salary & Benefits Study marks the ninth consecutive edition
of this study. The 2022–2023 version employed a slightly revised and updated survey instrument. The
survey tracked the demographics, salary, benefits, and other elements of the employment agreements
of school superintendents throughout the country.

This year’s study results are based on 2,443 complete responses — the highest response rate since
inception of the study in 1999. The survey was distributed online and relied on superintendents
responding to 69 items with the understanding that the report of findings would contain no personally
identifiable information. Therefore, readers must consider the data descriptive and not necessarily
representative of all superintendents. The study is intended to provide superintendents with actionable
information needed to negotiate and manage their compensation and benefits.

Prior to the AASA efforts to study this topic, most school superintendents relied on the annual salary
study sponsored by the Education Research Service (ERS) to benchmark their compensation and
benefits. The closure of ERS nearly a decade ago created a void in data about superintendent salary
and benefits.

AASA responded to the need for data by developing a comprehensive study of the salary and benefits
of school superintendents that far exceeded previous studies undertaken on this topic. AASA is
particularly well suited for this task because it represents the vast majority of school superintendents
in the country and has been most active in collecting and disseminating to its members critical data
needed to inform superintendent decision making about a host of topics.

AASA is committed to refining this work over time, thus maximizing the benefit to superintendents.
The earlier editions of this study are available on the AASA website and provide valuable retrospective
data (http://www.aasa.org/research.aspx).

This work complements The American School Superintendent: 2020 Decennial Study edited by Professor
Christopher H. Tienken, the AASA Research Professor in Residence and Associate Professor of
Education Leadership, Management, and Policy from Seton Hall University, sponsored by AASA in
conjunction with Phi Delta Kappa. The official press release for the 2020 Decennial Study can found

In addition, there is an inevitable comparison between public and private sector CEOs. Useful in this
discussion is the work of Economic Policy Institute in its 2022 analysis on private sector CEO

METHODOLOGY

The research team was comprised of Tara Thomas, AASA legislative analyst; Dr. Christopher H.
Tienken, AASA Research Professor in Residence and Associate Professor of Education Leadership,
Management, and Policy; Dr. Li Kang, Seton Hall University; and Seton Hall University doctoral
students Nadia Bennett, Sean Cronin, and Jillian Torrento. Technical assistance was provided by Dr.
Robert S. McCord, AASA research consultant. The research was conducted under the direct
supervision of Noelle Ellerson Ng, AASA Associate Executive Director, Policy and Advocacy.

An extensive survey instrument was originally developed in 2012 with the assistance of Professors
Theodore J. Kowalski (University of Dayton), I. Phillip Young (University of South Carolina), Terry
Orr (Bank Street College), and Christopher C. Stream (University of Nevada, Las Vegas). The survey
instrument was revised between July – September 2022 by the research team for the current edition
of the study. The research team sent the revised instrument for peer review by eight superintendents:
    • Dr. Sharon L. Contreras, Superintendent, Guilford County Schools, Greensboro, NC.
    • Dr. Burke Royster, Superintendent, Greenville County Schools, Greenville, SC.
    • Dr. Lee D’Andrea, Superintendent (Retired), Anderson School District Four and Pickens
        County School District, SC.
    • Dr. Holly Edds, Superintendent, Orcutt Union School District, Orcutt, CA.
    • Dr. Anne Hubbard, Superintendent, Hope Elementary School District, Santa Barbara, CA.
    • Mrs. Susan Salucci, Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources, Orcutt Union School
        District, Orcutt, CA.
    • Dr. Gregory C. Hutchings, Jr., Superintendent, Alexandria City Public Schools, Alexandria,
        VA.
    • Dr. Michael Lubelfeld, Superintendent of Schools, North Shore School District 112, Highland
        Park, IL.

Using a commercially prepared mailing list of American public school superintendents, email
invitations to participate were distributed during the months of September and October 2022. No
official count of the number of public school superintendents exists. The National Center for
Education Statistics reported that there were 13,452 school districts as of the last count in 2019, but
that number includes non-operating districts, counties that have multiple districts but only one
superintendent, and districts that share a superintendent. State association executive directors were
contacted to encourage their members to respond to the online survey.

REPORT OF FINDINGS

This report of findings is divided into 11 sections and relies solely on measures of central tendency
for the analysis of the data collected. In some cases, the data are generally disaggregated by gender,
district enrollment, and racial/cultural group.

As noted in previous reports, there are limitations on the proper use of the data:




                                                                                                     2
    •   When the responses for certain items are disaggregated by racial/cultural group, the number
        of responses may be insufficient to support decision making.
    •   Care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences on this data element.
    •   In addition, some survey fatigue is commonly reported by superintendents and could have
        impacted the return rate, although it should be noted that the number of valid responses
        received was the largest since the inception of the current survey that was first administered
        in 2012.

After each data display in the report, authors offer general statements of findings. It is the intent of
the authors to allow the readers the opportunity to disaggregate the data in a manner they find useful
in working with their board of education.

There were 2,450 total responses to the survey. After carefully checking the data, responses from
seven participants were omitted as the research team found them to be invalid because of issues related
to missing salaries and other entries. The final sample size was 2,443. The seven omitted participant
responses equated to 0.29% of the total responses; 99.71% of the total responses were retained.

Readers will note that respondents omitted responses to some questions. Therefore, the n-value will
be less than 2,443 in some cases. In addition, some percentages in the tables presented may total
between 99.4% and 100.8% due to rounding. Having clearly identified the limitations inherent in a
study of this magnitude, the report that follows is replete with important information that can prove
very useful to superintendents.

*** Care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences from the very small numbers of
respondents in some of the racial/cultural groups, other than the fact that White (not Hispanic)
superintendents constitute the largest racial group represented in the study. Other racial/cultural groups
appear to be underrepresented in the superintendent ranks, especially when compared to the
racial/cultural profile of American public school enrollment.

Findings: Where sufficient numbers existed, there were differences by race/cultural group and
enrollment. Almost 87% of superintendents who identified as White work in districts with enrollments
of fewer than 5,000 students compared to 54.25% of superintendents who identified as Black or
African American and 48.46% of superintendents who identified as Hispanic or Latino.
Only 13.48% of superintendents who identified as White worked in districts with more 5,000 students
compared to 45.75% of superintendents who identified as Black or African American and 51.34% of
superintendents who identified as Hispanic or Latino.

regardless of gender, indicated that their district was best described as rural which is 5% higher than
the previous year and 25.21% described their district as suburban, compared to 25% the previous year.
Little difference existed between gender and district description where sample size was large.

Findings: Where numbers were sufficient, there were some differences based on race/cultural group
and years in present position. Higher percentages of superintendents who identified as Hispanic or
Latino (58.33%), or Black or African American (58.51%) indicated they were in their present positions
1–5 years compared to superintendents who identified as White (47.01%).
The statistics are similar for total years of experience as a superintendent with superintendents who
identified as Hispanic or Latino (54.17%) or Black or African American (47.87%) indicated they had
1–5 years of total experience as a superintendent compared to superintendents who identified as White
(38.40%).

Findings: The findings for this year’s investigation suggest that a higher percentage (32.54%) of
superintendents believed their districts were in declining economic conditions compared to the
previous year (26.8%), but less than those from 2020–2021 report in which 35.5% of superintendents
described their districts as having declining economic conditions.

Findings: Where numbers were sufficient, differences existed by race/cultural group. Higher
percentages of superintendents who identified as Black or African American (56.38%) held an EdD
compared to those who identified as White (33.38%). Conversely, only 13.2% of superintendents who
identified as Black or African American held a master’s degree compared to 38.9% of superintendents
who identified as White.
Note: As indicated in the introduction, care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences
from the very small numbers of respondents in some of the racial/cultural groups, other than the fact
that White (not Hispanic) superintendents were the largest group represented in the study. Other
racial/cultural groups appeared to be underrepresented in the superintendent ranks, especially when
compared to the racial/cultural profile of American public school enrollment.

Findings: 89.11% of superintendents intended to remain as superintendent in their current district
next year (2023–2024). Only approximately 6.05% of superintendents indicated they would leave
public education and only 5.32% stated they would retire and .57% stated they would leave education
for some other reason or go to work in a non-education related field.

Findings: Larger districts do not necessarily have lower per pupil costs than smaller districts. Almost
half (48.5%) of the districts represented in the sample spend between $7,500–$12,499 per pupil.

          Mean                                     $156,468
Findings: Consistent with previous years, salaries increased as district enrollment increased. It should
be noted that sample sizes for enrollments beyond 49,999 were small and not useful for statistical
purposes. The mean salary was $156,468 in 2022–2023, compared to $158,670 the previous year.
The overall median salary for the entire sample was $145,000 in 2022–2023 compared to $147,000 the
previous year.
The mean salary in 2012–2013 was $131,171 and the median was $123,775. The mean salary has
increased approximately 16.2% over the last decade whereas the median salary has risen about 14.7%
during the same time period.

Findings: Although males were overrepresented in the superintendency (74%) compared to females
(26%), the median salary of female superintendents was slightly higher than that of males for the 6th
time during the last 11 years.
Male superintendents earned 99% of what females earned in 2022–2023. The data suggest that this
difference was not a function of district enrollment as females tended to work in smaller districts, nor
was it a result of years of experiences, as females in this year’s survey reported having fewer years of
experience in the superintendency.
The results from the 2022–2023 Salary and Benefit Study stand in contrast to pre-pandemic national
wage data. Nationally, females earn about 82% of what men earn across all job categories and levels
of education (Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, 2018). The wage gap
nationally persists even when comparing men and women with equal education attainment. In fields
that require advanced degrees and have higher percentages of females employed compared to males,
like education, a pay gap favoring males still exists. Females earn 90% of what males earn in the field

Findings: When base salary was considered by racial/cultural group, some variation was noted, with
Black and African American and Hispanic and Latino earning more than superintendents who
identified as White. Care should be taken in interpreting the data because of the small number of
respondents in some groups making definitive analysis difficult, if not inappropriate.

do not exist. A modest but consistent increase in median salaries was seen over previous editions of
this study.

Findings: Similar to their high school counterparts, middle school principal base median salaries were
loosely related to district enrollment and generally increased as district enrollment increased.

Findings: Elementary school principals generally followed the same trend as their high school and
middle school counterparts: median salary increased as enrollment increased. In addition, for the first
time, their 2022–2023 median base salary in districts with enrollments of 3,000–4,999 exceeded
$100,000.

*= sample size less than 40
Findings: A metric of importance in the private sector was the ratio of the entry level worker
compensation with the base salary (without incentives) of the CEO. The median entry-level base salary
of teachers was presented compared with the median base salary of superintendents arrayed by district
size for a three-year time period: 2022–2023, 2021–2022, and 2020–2021.
This year’s data suggest that the ratio between median superintendent salary and median salary for a
starting teacher remained relatively stable over the three-year time period across enrollment groups.
Furthermore, the 2022–2023 ratios of median superintendent salary by enrollment to median starting
teacher salary by enrollment are now less than those from 2015–2016.
Where numbers were sufficient, the ratios between the median base salary for a superintendent and
the median base salary for a starting teacher ranged from 1:2.65 to 1:4.7.
The Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance reported in 2018 that the ratio of CEO
base salary to entry level employee base salary for the 3000 small and mid-cap corporations that
comprise the Russell 3000 (excluding the 500 largest corporations in the United States) was 1:166. The
AFL-CIO reported that the 2020 ratio of CEO base salary to entry level employee base salary for the
500 largest corporations in the United States was 1:299.

Findings: Similar to the previous year, where numbers were sufficient, superintendents in districts
with enrollments of 300–999 students were less likely to have their employment contracts specify the
process, measures, and indicators to be used for their formal performance evaluations.
Although differences were noted by race / ethnicity, with superintendents who identified as Black or
African American and Hispanic or Latino demonstrating the inclusion of this provision more
frequently, it is believed those differences were related to enrollments and not race, as noted in Table
1.3A.

Findings: There was a decrease in the percentage of superintendents whose formal performance
evaluation was linked to student outcomes / performance from about 41% in 2021–2022 to 37.21%


                                                                                                     32
in 2022–2023. Since 2015–2016, percentages have fluctuated between 34.1% in 2015–2016 and almost
43% in 2020–2021. (41% 42.8%; 41.2%; 36.7%; 35.1%; 34.1%).
There were no differences noted by gender. There was a positive relationship between enrollment and
this provision. As enrollment increased, the frequency of having the provision in a contract increased.
Where numbers were sufficient, superintendents who identified as Black or African American
(54.26%) and Hispanic or Latino (50%) more frequently had this provision included compared to
superintendents who identified as White (36%). However, this appears to be a function of enrollment,
with the majority of superintendents who identified as White serving in smaller districts.

Findings: Almost 35% of superintendents had the outcomes of their formal evaluation released to
the public — a 5% decrease from the previous year, and only 1% higher than 2019–2020. When
considered by gender and race / ethnicity, there were no notable differences.

provision.

Findings: Approximately 36% of superintendents had a provision in their contract that included a
contribution to an annuity by the district. The data suggest a decrease of 10 percentage points from
last year when 46% of superintendents indicated they had such a provision. This appears to be the
first decrease since at least 2016. The most common contribution was $1,000–$5,000 (14.08%).

Findings: Where a sufficient number of respondents existed, there was a partial relationship between
enrollment and having a provision for post-retirement contributions to health insurance from the
district. The percentage of superintendents with the provision increased as enrollment increased up
to districts with enrollments of 10,000 or more students.
