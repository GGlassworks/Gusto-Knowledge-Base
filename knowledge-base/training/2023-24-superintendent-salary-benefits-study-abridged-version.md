              2023–2024 AASA SUPERINTENDENT
                 SALARY & BENEFITS STUDY

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The 2023–2024 AASA Superintendent Salary & Benefits Study marks the twelfth consecutive edition
of this report. The 2023–2024 version employed a slightly revised and updated survey instrument. The
survey tracked the demographics, salary, benefits, and other elements of the employment agreements
of school superintendents throughout the country.

This year’s study results are based on 2,706 complete responses — the highest response rate since
inception of the study in 1999. The survey was distributed online and relied on superintendents
responding to 66 items with the understanding that the report of findings would contain no personally
identifiable information. Therefore, readers must consider the data descriptive and not necessarily
representative of all superintendents. The study is intended to provide superintendents with actionable
information needed to negotiate and manage their compensation and benefits.

Prior to the AASA efforts to study this topic, most school superintendents relied on the annual salary
study sponsored by the Education Research Service (ERS) to benchmark their compensation and
benefits. The closure of ERS in 2011 created a void in data about superintendent salary and benefits.

AASA responded to the need for data by developing a comprehensive study of the salary and benefits
of school superintendents that far exceeded previous studies undertaken on this topic. AASA is
particularly well suited for this task because it represents the vast majority of school superintendents
in the country and has been the most active in collecting and disseminating to its members critical
data needed to inform superintendent decision making about a host of topics.

AASA is committed to refining this work over time, thus maximizing the benefit to superintendents.
The earlier editions of this study are available on the AASA website and provide valuable retrospective
data (http://www.aasa.org/research.aspx).

Discussion of superintendent salaries and benefits brings about the inevitable comparison between
public and private sector CEOs. Useful in this discussion is the article that appeared in the AASA
School Administrator in September 2023, “To Cap or Not To Cap,” by Christopher Tienken
(https://www.aasa.org/resources/resource/to-cap-or-not-to-cap) and the work of the Economic Policy
Institute in its 2022 analysis on private sector CEO compensation and its relationship to median
employee pay (https://www.epi.org/press/ceo-pay-rose-more-than-11-in-2021-ceos-were-paid-399-

METHODOLOGY

The research team was comprised of Tara Thomas, AASA policy analyst; Dr. Christopher H. Tienken,
AASA Research Professor in Residence, Associate Professor of Education Leadership, Management,
and Policy, Seton Hall University and External Member of the Faculty in the Department of Education
Sciences at the University of Catania, Italy; Dr. Jennifer Timmer, Assistant Professor of Education
Leadership, Management, and Policy Seton Hall University; Dr. Sean Cronin, Matawan School
District, NJ; and Seton Hall University doctoral students Samantha Lott-Velez, Assistant
Superintendent, and Michael J. Fetherman, Superintendent. Technical assistance was provided by Dr.
Robert S. McCord, AASA research consultant. The research was conducted under the direct
supervision of Noelle Ellerson Ng, AASA Associate Executive Director, Policy and Advocacy.

An extensive survey instrument was originally developed in 2012 with the assistance of Professors
Theodore J. Kowalski (University of Dayton), I. Phillip Young (University of South Carolina), Terry
Orr (Bank Street College), and Christopher C. Stream (University of Nevada, Las Vegas). The survey
instrument was revised slightly between July – September 2023 under the direction of Dr. Christopher
Tienken for the current edition of the study. Peer review feedback of the survey was received by eight
superintendents:
    • Dr. Raymond Sanchez, Superintendent, Tarrytown Union Free School District, Sleepy Hollow
       NY.
    • Dr. Tim Dilg, Superintendent, Valley Park School District, St. Louis, MO.
    • Dr. Wendy Birhanzel, Superintendent, Harrison School District Two, Colorado Springs, CO.
    • Krestin Bahr, Superintendent, Peninsula School District 401, Gig Harbor, WA.
    • Dr. Lance Evans, Superintendent, New Albany City School District, New Albany, MS.
    • Heidi Sipe, Superintendent, Umatilla School District 6R, Umatilla, OR.
    • David Law, Superintendent, Minnetonka ISD 276, Minnetonka, MN.
    • Dr. Rupak Gandhi, Superintendent, Fargo School District 1, Fargo, ND.

The review resulted in the elimination of three questions. Using a commercially prepared mailing list
of American public school superintendents, email invitations to participate were distributed during
the months of October and November 2023. No official exact count of the number of public school
superintendents exists. The National Center for Education Statistics reported that there were 19,071
school districts as of the last count in 2021, but that number includes non-operating districts, counties
that have multiple districts but only one superintendent, and districts that share a superintendent. State
association executive directors were contacted to encourage their members to respond to the online
survey.




                                                                                                        2
REPORT OF FINDINGS

This 93-page report of findings is divided into 11 sections, includes 104 tables, and relies solely on
measures of central tendency for the analysis of the data collected. In some cases, the data are
disaggregated by gender, district enrollment, and racial/cultural group.

As noted in previous reports, there are limitations on the proper use of the data:
    • When the responses for certain items are disaggregated by racial/cultural group and
        enrollment, the number of responses may be insufficient to support decision making.
    • Care should be exercised in generalizing results to all superintendents in the country.
    • In addition, some survey fatigue is commonly reported by superintendents and could have
       impacted the return rate, although it should be noted that the number of valid responses
       received was the largest since the inception of the current survey that was first administered
       in 2012.

After each data display in the report, authors offer general statements of findings. It is the intent of
the authors to allow the readers the opportunity to disaggregate the data in a manner they find useful
in working with their boards of education.

There were 2,711 responses to the survey. After carefully checking the data, responses from five
participants were omitted as the research team found them to be invalid because of issues related to
missing salaries and other entries. The final sample size was 2,706. The five omitted participant
responses equated to 0.19% of the total responses; 99.81% of the total responses were retained in the
sample.

** Readers will note that respondents omitted responses to some questions. Therefore, the n-value
fluctuates among the questions and can be less than 2,706 in some cases. In addition, some percentages
in the tables presented may total between 99.4% and 100.6% due to rounding. Note that some
percentage totals have been rounded to the nearest full percentage point to aid in readability.

*** Care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences from the very small numbers of
respondents in some of the racial/cultural groups, other than the fact that White (not Hispanic)
superintendents constitute the largest racial group represented in the study. Other racial/cultural groups
appear to be underrepresented in the superintendent ranks, especially when compared to the
racial/cultural profile of American public school student enrollment.

Having clearly identified the limitations inherent in a study of this magnitude, the report that follows
is replete with important information that can prove very useful to superintendents for the purpose
of contract negotiations.

Findings: Where sufficient numbers existed, there were differences by race/cultural group and
enrollment. Approximately 73% of superintendents who identified as White work in districts with
enrollments of fewer than 3,000 students compared to 48% of superintendents who identified as Black
or African American and 45% of superintendents who identified as Hispanic or Latino.

Findings: Where numbers were sufficient, there is a relationship between enrollment and urbanicity.
As enrollment increases, the percentage of districts categorized as urban and suburban increases and
those categorized as rural decreases. Approximately 93% of districts with fewer than 300 students
were categorized as rural, whereas only 16.78% of districts with 10,000–24,999 students were
categorized as rural.
Only 63% of districts with fewer than 300 students were categorized as urban, whereas almost 32%
of districts with 10,000–24,999 students were categorized as urban.

Findings: Where the number of responses was sufficient, there does appear to be a relationship
between enrollment and years of experience as a superintendent. As enrollment increases, so do the
years of experience. For example, almost half (45.5%) of superintendents with five or fewer years of
experience work in districts with less than 1,000 students compared to superintendents with 11–15
years of experience (33.25%).

Findings: Where numbers were sufficient, differences existed by race/cultural group. Higher
percentages of superintendents who identified as Black or African American (76.86%) held an EdD
or PhD compared to those who identified as White (43.20%) and those who identified as Hispanic or
Latino (50%).
Note: As indicated in the introduction, care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences
from the very small numbers of respondents in some of the racial/cultural groups, other than the fact
that White (not Hispanic) superintendents were the largest group represented in the study. Other
racial/cultural groups appeared to be underrepresented in the superintendent ranks, especially when
compared to the racial/cultural profile of American public school enrollment.

Findings: Similar to last year’s findings, almost 9/10 (88%) of respondents intend to remain as
superintendent in their current district next year (2024–2025) and overall, 92.03% reported they will
continue to serve in the position of superintendent. Only 5.35% of respondents stated they would
retire next year.
There were no differences by gender or race/cultural group where the number of responses was
sufficient.
Care should be taken when interpreting these numbers as sampling bias may influence the results.

    Findings: Larger districts do not necessarily have lower per pupil costs than smaller districts. For
    example, 10% of districts with fewer than 300 students spend $10,000–$12,999 per pupil compared
    to 11% of districts with enrollments of 5,000–9,999 students. Almost half (45.86%) of the districts
    represented in the sample spend between $7,500–$12,499 per pupil.
    *N count was 2,640. Responses for districts with enrollments of 100,000 or above were excluded due
    to small N count.

    Mean Salary                              165799

Findings: Consistent with results since the inception of the study, median salaries generally
demonstrate an increase as district enrollments increase. However, caution should be taken with
interpretations for enrollments above 24,999 due to smaller sample sizes.

The mean salary for the respondents in this year’s sample was $165,799. The mean salary is an indicator
of the average salary of the population, but means can be affected by outliers; unusually high or low
numbers. Therefore, we also report the median salary for the various enrollment categories. The
median salary for the entire sample was $156,000. The median salary figure is generally accepted by
economists as a more accurate measure because it is less affected by outliers.

Although salaries in our samples have increased over the last decade, evidence suggests they have not
kept pace with inflation. The mean salary reported for the 2013 sample was $131,171. and the median
was $123,775. When adjusted for inflation, using the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index
calculator, the mean real wage for superintendents in 2013, using 2023 dollars, would be $172,651,
which is $6,852 above this year’s reported mean salary. The inflation adjusted median salary from 2013
would be $162,916, which is $6,916 above this year’s median salary. Stated another way, over the last
decade, superintendent real wages have decreased about $7,000 below where they should be if their
salaries were annually adjusted for inflation.

Findings: Although males were overrepresented in the superintendency (73%) compared to females
(27%), the median salary of female superintendents was slightly higher than that of males for the 7th
time during the last 12 years.
Male superintendents earned 99.5% of what females earned in 2023–2024. The data suggest that this
difference was not a function of district enrollment as females tended to work in smaller districts, nor
was it a result of years of experiences, as females in this year’s survey reported having slightly fewer
years of experience in the superintendency.

Findings: Where sufficient numbers of respondents existed, some variation was noted in median
salaries. Superintendents who identified as Black and African American and Hispanic and Latino had
higher median salaries than superintendents who identified as White. Care should be taken in
interpreting the data because of the small number of respondents in some groups and the
overrepresentation of superintendents who identified as White, making definitive analysis difficult, if
not inappropriate. Some of the variation in median salaries may be due to the fact that higher
percentages of superintendents who identified as Black and African American and Hispanic and
Latino work in larger and more urbanized districts.

Findings: Where sufficient numbers of responses existed, superintendents with either an EdD or
PhD had higher median salaries.

Findings: The median salary in rural districts was lower than that of suburban and urban. Some of
the difference may be related to rural districts having smaller enrollments on average than suburban
and urban districts.

Findings: Consistent with findings in previous editions of the study, base salary for
assistant/associate superintendents increases as enrollment increases. It is noted that in districts with
lower enrollments, these positions often do not exist.

Findings: Consistent with findings in previous editions of the study, the larger the student enrollment
of the district, the higher the mean base salary for high school principal when sample sizes exceeded
35 responses. Omitted responses are due mostly to some districts not having high schools or the
position of high school principal.

Findings: Similar to their high school counterparts, middle school principal base median salaries were
loosely related to district enrollment and generally increased as district enrollment increased.

Findings: Elementary school principals generally followed the same trend as their high school and
middle school counterparts: median salary increased as enrollment increased. In addition, for the first
time, their 2023–2024 median base salary in districts with enrollments of 1,000–2,999 reached
$100,000.

Findings: A metric of importance in the private sector is the ratio of the entry level worker
compensation to the base salary (without incentives) of the CEO. The three-year calculations for
median entry-level base salary of teachers were presented compared with the median base salary of
superintendents arrayed by district size. This year’s data suggest that the ratio between median
superintendent salary and median salary for a starting teacher remained relatively stable over the three-
year time period across enrollment groups. Furthermore, the 2023–2024 ratios of median
superintendent salary by enrollment to median starting teacher salary by enrollment continued to
remain below the ratios from 2015–2016.
As noted in “To Cap or Not to Cap” in the AASA School Administrator (Tienken, 2023), the AFL-CIO
reported that the 2021 ratio of CEO base salary to entry level employee base salary for the 500 largest
corporations in the United States was 299:1. A 2021 report by Willis Towers Watson found that the
average pay ratio of CEOs to entry level employees in the S&P 1500 group of companies was 102:1.

Findings: Where numbers are sufficient, there appears to be a relationship between race/ethnicity
and the performance evaluation being linked to student outcomes. However, this should be
interpreted carefully, as evidence suggests that the relationship may be related to enrollment rather
than race and the fact that more superintendents of color work in larger districts compared to
superintendents who identified as White (See Table 1.3 and 3.5B).

Findings: Where the numbers were sufficient, there were some relationships, by enrollment, in the
percentage of superintendents whose districts contributed to an annuity, especially for superintendents
that received $10,000 a year or more in contributions. Superintendents in districts with 300 or fewer
students were the least likely to receive the benefit (17%) compared with superintendents in larger
districts (e.g., 5,000–9,999 students: approximately 60%).

Findings: Where a sufficient number of respondents existed, there was a partial relationship between
enrollment and having a provision for post-retirement contributions to health insurance from the
district. The percentage of superintendents with the provision increased as enrollment increased up
to districts with enrollments of 10,000–24,999 students.

their contracts compared to 15% in 2021–2022, 17% in 2020–2021, and 10% in 2019–2020.
Where numbers were sufficient, there were differences by race/cultural group. Performance clauses
were more common for superintendents who identified as Black or African American (25.62%) than
superintendents who identified as White (12.85%) or Latino or Hispanic (22.64). As noted earlier, this
could be related to enrollment rather than race/cultural group. There were no differences by gender.

Findings: Where a sufficient number of respondents existed, there was a relationship between
enrollment and superintendent use of legal counsel or other outside agents. In general, as enrollment
increased so, too, did the use of legal counsel or outside agents.

Findings: Where responses were sufficient, there was evidence of variance in the percentages of
superintendents who employed legal counsel or other outside agents. Approximately, 55% of
superintendents who identified as Black or African American and 51% of superintendents who
identified as Hispanic or Latino employed legal counsel or other outside agents compared to 34% of
superintendents who identified as White.
As noted earlier in the report, care should be taken in interpreting these findings. The data suggest
that enrollment might be a contributing factor to the differences between race/cultural group results.

Findings: Almost 61% of school districts used legal counsel to assist in the development and/or
negotiations of the superintendents’ employment contract, an increase of almost five percentage
points compared to last year. However, in 2020–2021, 65% of districts employed counsel.

    every year.                                                                                                      1

Other, please explain: When this happened one year, the Board agreed to pay out the days over the cap,
    as an exception.                                                                                                 1
Other, please explain: We do not carry over vacation days. We do not have personal days.
    Personal/sick days are the same.                                                                                 1
Other, please explain: 1. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, my Board and I agreed that the traditional model
    of pre-determined leave/accrual and buy-out schedule is not conducive to the role of a superintendent.
    Therefore, we negotiated a structure where the superintendent can take leave as they seem fit, determined
    by the ebb and flow of their work and all most of the previous buy-out/accrual structures will stay in place



                                                                                                                         87
    for compensation. The contract language provides flexibility and is an economic benefit to the
    superintendent without being an exhaustive cost to the district. It is an increase to the district, but the
    BOE is paying the superintendent to get the work done and take time as they need versus paying them
    to be off for a predetermined amount of time, which may or may not be feasible/realistic.                     1
Other, please explain: No vacation granted, no cap on PN.                                                         1
Other, please explain: No vacation days can be carried over. The superintendent can accumulate and be
    compensated for up to 7 vacation days in a contract year. Personal leave turns into sick time and goes
    toward retirement credit.                                                                                     1
Other, please explain: No pay on personal, negotiate payment for vacation.                                        1
Other, please explain: No vacation days are rolled over, just lost.                                               1
