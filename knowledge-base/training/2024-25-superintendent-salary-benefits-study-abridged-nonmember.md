EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The 2024–2025 AASA Superintendent Salary & Benefits Study marks the thirteenth consecutive
edition of this report. The national survey tracked the demographics, salary, benefits, and other
elements of the employment agreements of school superintendents throughout the country.

This year’s study results are based on 2,077 complete responses. The survey was distributed online
and relied on superintendents responding to 66 items with the understanding that the report of
findings would contain no personally identifiable information. Therefore, readers must consider the
data descriptive and not necessarily representative of all superintendents. The study is intended to
provide superintendents with actionable information needed to negotiate and manage their compensation
and benefits.

Prior to the AASA efforts to study this topic, most school superintendents relied on the annual salary
study sponsored by the Education Research Service (ERS) to benchmark their compensation and
benefits. The closure of ERS in 2011 created a void in data about superintendent salary and benefits.

AASA responded to the need for data by developing a comprehensive study of the salary and benefits
of school superintendents that far exceeded previous studies undertaken on this topic. AASA is
particularly well suited for this task because it represents the vast majority of school superintendents
in the country and has been the most active in collecting and disseminating to its members critical
data needed to inform superintendent decision making about a host of topics.

AASA is committed to refining this work over time, thus maximizing the benefit to superintendents.
The earlier editions of this study are available on the AASA website and provide valuable retrospective
data (http://www.aasa.org/research.aspx).

Discussion of superintendent salaries and benefits brings about the inevitable comparison between
public and private sector CEOs. Useful in this discussion is the article that appeared in the AASA
School Administrator in September 2023, “To Cap or Not To Cap” by Christopher Tienken and the
work of the Economic Policy Institute in its 2022 analysis on private sector CEO compensation and its
relationship to median employee pay.

METHODOLOGY

The research team was comprised of Tara Thomas, AASA Government Affairs Manager; Dr.
Christopher H. Tienken, AASA Research Professor in Residence, Associate Professor of Education


                                                                                                      1
Leadership, Management, and Policy, Seton Hall University, NJ, and External Member of the Faculty
in the Department of Education Sciences at the University of Catania, Italy; Dr. Jennifer Timmer,
Assistant Professor of Education Leadership, Management, and Policy, Seton Hall University, NJ; Dr.
Li Kang, University of Alabama, AL; Dr. Sean Cronin, Matawan School District, NJ; and Seton Hall
University Education Leadership doctoral students Elizabeth Nunez and Ryan Gorman. The research
was conducted under the direct supervision of Noelle Ellerson Ng, AASA Associate Executive
Director, Advocacy and Governance.

An extensive survey instrument was originally developed in 2012 with the assistance of Professors
Theodore J. Kowalski (University of Dayton), I. Phillip Young (University of South Carolina), Terry
Orr (Bank Street College), and Christopher C. Stream (University of Nevada, Las Vegas). The survey
instrument was revised over the years to reflect changes in the compensation landscape. The latest
revision occurred between July – September 2024 under the direction of Dr. Christopher Tienken for
the current edition of the study. Peer review feedback of the survey was received by nine
superintendents:
    ● Dr. Daniel Hile, Noblesville School District, Noblesville, IN.
    ● Dr. Bryan Luizzi, New Canaan Public Schools, New Canaan, CT.
    ● Dr. Jennifer Kelsall, Ridgewood Community High School, Norridge, IL.
    ● Dr. Lance Evans, Superintendent, New Albany City School District, New Albany, MS.
    ● Heidi Sipe, Superintendent, Umatilla School District 6R, Umatilla, OR.
    ● Randall W. Squier, Coxsackie-Athens Central School District, NY.
    ● Dr. Rupak Gandhi, Fargo School District 1, Fargo, ND.
    ● Dr. Dan J. Schnoes, Educational Services Unit #3, LaVista, NE.
    ● Dr. Eric Conti, Burlington Public Schools, Burlington, MA.

The review resulted in revisions to improve the clarification of the response choices of three questions.

Using a commercially prepared mailing list of public school superintendents in the United States, email
invitations to participate in the survey were distributed during the months of October and November
2024. Additionally, AASA collaborated with the Association of Latino Administrators and
Superintendents (ALAS) with dissemination to their membership.

No official exact count of the number of public school superintendents exists. The National Center
for Education Statistics reported that there were 19,071 school districts as of the last count in 2021,
but that number includes non-operating districts, counties that have multiple districts but only one
superintendent, and districts that share a superintendent. State association executive directors were
contacted to encourage their members to respond to the online survey.




                                                                                                       2
REPORT OF FINDINGS

This 80-page report of findings is divided into 11 sections with 94 tables and relies solely on measures
of central tendency for the analysis of the data collected. In some cases, the data are disaggregated by
gender, district enrollment, and racial/cultural group.

As noted in previous reports, there are limitations on the proper use of the data:
    ● When the responses for certain items are disaggregated by racial/cultural group and
        enrollment, the number of responses may be insufficient to support decision making.
    ● Care should be exercised in generalizing results to all superintendents in the country.
    ● In addition, some survey fatigue is commonly reported by superintendents and could have
        impacted the return rate.

After each data display in the report, authors offer general statements of findings. It is the intent of
the authors to allow the readers the opportunity to disaggregate the data in a manner they find useful
in working with their boards of education.

There were 2,088 total responses to the survey. After carefully checking the data, responses from
eleven participants were omitted as the research team found them to be invalid because the respondent
was either an interim superintendent working on a per diem contract or a respondent did not report
valid data. The final sample size was 2,077. The eleven omitted participant responses equated to 0.05%
of the total responses; 99.95% of the total responses were retained in the sample.

** Readers will note that respondents omitted responses to some questions. Therefore, the n-value
fluctuates among the questions and can be less than 2,077 in some cases. In addition, some percentages
in the tables presented may total between 99.4% and 100.6% due to rounding. Note that some
percentage totals have been rounded to the nearest full percentage point to aid in readability.

*** Care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences from the very small numbers of
respondents in some of the racial/cultural groups, other than the fact that White (not Hispanic)
superintendents constitute the largest racial group represented in the study. Other racial/cultural
groups appear to be underrepresented in the superintendent ranks, especially when compared to the
racial/cultural profile of American public school student enrollment.

Having clearly identified the limitations inherent in a study of this magnitude, the report that follows
is replete with important information that can prove very useful to superintendents for the purpose
of contract negotiations.

Findings: The mean age of the superintendent was 52.23, two years older than the previous year and
the same as 2022–2023. The median age was 52, as it was in the 2022–2023 study. The modal response
was 51–60 years of age (51.61%) and 38.01% of respondents were 50 years old or younger in 2024–
2025 compared to 34.71% in 2022–2023.
Similar to last year, nearly 86% of respondents were ages 41–60 years old. More people appear to be
ascending to the superintendent position at an earlier age than over a decade ago. A noticeably higher
percentage of superintendents were in the 41–50 age range (34.38%) in the 2024–2025 study compared
to 29.83% in 2012. The percentage of superintendents ages 60+ decreased from 19.48% in 2012 to
just 9.87% in 2024–2025.

Findings: Where sufficient numbers existed, there were differences by race/cultural group and
enrollment. Approximately 73% of superintendents who identified as White worked in districts with
enrollments of fewer than 3,000 students compared to 52% of superintendents who identified as Black
or African American and 52% of superintendents who identified as Hispanic or Latino.

enrollment increased, the percentage of districts categorized as urban and suburban increased and
those categorized as rural decreased.

  Findings: Where numbers were sufficient, there were some differences based on race/cultural group
  and years in present position. A higher percentage of superintendents who identified as Black or
  African American (76%) indicated they were in their present positions fewer than six years compared
  to superintendents who identified as White (63%) or Hispanic or Latino (70%).

Findings: Where numbers were sufficient, differences existed by race/cultural group. Higher
percentages of superintendents who identified as Black or African American (80.41%) held a doctorate
compared to those who identified as White (41%) and those who identified as Hispanic or Latino
(57.7%).
Note: As indicated in the introduction, care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences
from the small numbers of respondents in some of the racial/cultural groups, other than the fact that
White (not Hispanic) superintendents were the largest group represented in the study. Other
racial/cultural groups appeared to be underrepresented in the superintendent ranks, especially when
compared to the racial/cultural profile of American public school enrollment.

Findings: Similar to findings over the last three years, almost 9/10 (89.74%) of respondents intend
to remain as superintendent in their current district next year (2025–2026). Overall, 92.82% reported
they would continue to serve in the position of superintendent. Only 5.64% of respondents stated
they would retire next year.
There were no differences by gender or race/cultural group where the number of responses was
sufficient.
Care should be taken when interpreting these numbers as sampling bias may influence the results.

     Findings: Larger districts do not necessarily have lower per pupil costs than smaller districts. For
     example, approximately 60% of districts with enrollments above 10,000 students spend more than
     $10,000 per student compared to 63% of districts with enrollments below 10,000.
     *N count was 2,043.

    Mean Salary                                 169,343

Findings: Consistent with results since the inception of the study, median salaries generally
demonstrate an increase as district enrollments increase. However, caution should be taken with
interpretations for enrollments above 24,999 due to smaller sample sizes.

The mean salary for the respondents in this year’s sample was $169,343, an increase of 2.1% over last
year. The mean salary is an indicator of the average salary of the population but means can be affected
by outliers — unusually high or low numbers. Therefore, we also report the median salary for the
various enrollment categories. The median salary for the entire sample was $158,721, approximately a
1.74% increase over last year. The median salary figure is generally accepted by economists as a more
accurate measure because it is less affected by outliers.

Although median and mean salaries in our samples have increased over the last decade, evidence
suggests they have not kept pace with inflation. The mean salary reported for the 2013 sample was
$131,171 and the median was $123,775. When adjusted for inflation, using the Bureau of Labor
Statistics Consumer Price Index calculator, the mean real wage for superintendents in 2013, using
2024 dollars, would be $175,679, which is $6,336 above this year’s reported mean salary.

The inflation adjusted median salary from 2013 would be $165,773 today, which is $7,052 above this
year’s median salary. Stated another way, over the last decade, superintendent real wages have
decreased about $7,000 below where they should be if their salaries were annually adjusted for
inflation.

Findings: Keeping mind that males are overrepresented in the superintendency (73%) compared to
females (26%), the median salary of male superintendents was slightly higher than that of females for
only the 6th time in the last 13 years.
Female superintendents earned 99.16% of what males earned in 2024–2025.

Findings: Where sufficient numbers of respondents existed, some variation was noted in median
salaries. Superintendents who identified as Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino had
higher median salaries than superintendents who identified as White.
Care should be taken in interpreting the data because of the small number of respondents in some
groups and the overrepresentation of superintendents who identified as White, making definitive
analysis difficult, if not inappropriate. Some of the variation in median salaries may be due to the fact
that higher percentages of superintendents who identified as Black or African American and Hispanic
or Latino worked in larger and more urbanized districts.

Findings: The median salary in rural districts was lower than that of suburban and urban. Some of
the difference may be related to rural districts having smaller enrollments on average than suburban
and urban districts.

Findings: Consistent with findings in previous editions of the study, base salary for
assistant/associate superintendents increased as enrollment increased. It is noted that in districts with
lower enrollments, these positions often do not exist.

Findings: Consistent with findings in previous editions of the study, the larger the student enrollment
of the district, the higher the mean base salary for the high school principal when sample sizes
exceeded 35 responses. Omitted responses are due mostly to some districts not having high schools
or the position of high school principal.

Findings: Similar to their high school counterparts, middle school principal base median salaries were
related to district enrollment and generally increased as district enrollment increased.

Findings: Elementary school principals generally followed the same trend as their high school and
middle school counterparts: median salary increased as enrollment increased. In addition, for the first
time since the study’s inception, their 2024–2025 median base salary in districts with enrollments of
1,000–2,999 exceeded $100,000.

Findings: A metric of importance in the private sector is the ratio of the entry level worker
compensation to the base salary (without incentives) of the CEO. The four-year calculations for
median entry-level base salary of teachers were presented compared with the median base salary of
superintendents arrayed by district size. This year’s data suggest that the ratios between median
superintendent salary and median salary for a starting teacher are some of the lowest reported over

                                                                                                33
last four years across enrollment groups. Furthermore, the 2024–2025 ratios of median superintendent
salary by enrollment to median starting teacher salary by enrollment continued to remain generally
below the ratios from almost a decade ago in 2015–2016.
As noted in “To Cap or Not to Cap” in the AASA School Administrator (Tienken, 2023), the AFL-CIO
reported that the 2021 ratio of CEO base salary to entry level employee base salary for the 500 largest
corporations in the United States was 299:1. A 2021 report by Willis Towers Watson found that the
average pay ratio of CEOs to entry level employees in the S&P 1500 group of companies was 102:1.

Findings: Where numbers were sufficient, there appeared to be a relationship between race/ethnicity
and the performance evaluation being linked to student outcomes. However, this should be
interpreted carefully, as evidence suggests that the relationship may be related to enrollment rather
than race and the fact that more superintendents of color worked in larger districts compared to
superintendents who identified as White (See Table 1.3 and 3.5B).

Findings: A little more than 34% of superintendents had the outcomes of their formal evaluation
released to the public — a small decrease of less than 1% from the previous year and similar to 2019–
2020. When considered by gender, there were no notable differences.

Findings: The majority of superintendents (59.89%) received 11–15 days of sick leave per year. As
was the case in previous surveys, the findings for days of sick leave demonstrated little difference by
gender. In addition, sick leave across various district types (i.e., rural, urban, suburban), was generally
distributed evenly except for 15+days of leave. Superintendents in urban districts were somewhat
more likely to receive more than 15 days of sick leave annually than superintendents in rural and
suburban districts.

Findings: Approximately 74% of superintendents did not have a cap on sick leave carryover —an
increase of 2% from last year and 4% from 2022–2023. There was not a significant difference when
gender was considered.

Findings: Similar to years past, almost 80% of superintendents had a cap on vacation leave
carryover. Where numbers were sufficient, some differences existed by enrollment. Superintendents
in districts with fewer than 300 students were the most likely not to have a cap (28%), whereas those
in districts with enrollments of 3,000 to 4,999 were the most likely to have a cap (83%), followed by
those in districts with enrollments of 5,000 to 9,999 (82%).

Findings: Where a sufficient number of respondents existed, there was a relationship between
enrollment and superintendent use of legal counsel or other outside agents. In general, as enrollment
increased, so too did the use of legal counsel or outside agents.

Findings: Where responses were sufficient, there was evidence of variance in the percentages of
superintendents who employed legal counsel or other outside agents. Approximately, 57% of
superintendents who identified as Black or African American and 53% of superintendents who
identified as Hispanic or Latino employed legal counsel or other outside agents compared to 36% of
superintendents who identified as White.
As noted earlier in the report, care should be taken in interpreting these findings. The data suggest
that enrollment might be a contributing factor to the differences between race/cultural group results.

enrollment and district use of legal counsel or other outside agents in superintendent contract
negotiations. The district use of counsel increased as enrollment increased.
