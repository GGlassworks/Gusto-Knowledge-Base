2024 Report


Corporate
Recruiters
Survey
    N    ew jobs created by advances in technology and challenges in sustainable
         development are poised to reshape the labor market—and the direction of
    graduate management education. The growth of the skills economy means employers
    are increasingly focused on the specific capabilities of their future employees—
    perhaps creating tension between business schools’ role as a traditional purveyor of
    degrees and their role as a uniquely-positioned source of business talent with cutting-
    edge skills. The Corporate Recruiters Survey – 2024 Report affirms that GME programs
    continue to be trusted for their ability to develop graduates with increasingly
    relevant problem-solving and strategy skills, who are capable of tackling new and
    perennial challenges with an equal balance of tech and human understanding.

 What's new in 2024

 AI is dominating the conversation about the future of work—and therefore, the future of GME. Last year’s
 Corporate Recruiters Survey was conducted just a couple of months following the launch of OpenAI’s
 ChatGPT—a turning point in the public awareness of generative AI. This launched a new wave of intense
 discussion about how AI may supplement or replace knowledge workers—like those with GME degrees—who
 previously did not face the same prospects of replacement when compared to workers with more repetitive
 job functions.

 Last year’s report offered some insights about how tech-concerned employers predicted knowledge of
 artificial intelligence would grow in importance alongside other technology-related skills like cloud-based
 technology or Web3, blockchain, and virtual reality. This year’s report digs even deeper into how employers
 view the current and future importance of artificial intelligence, how prepared they believe candidates are
 to exercise AI skills in their organizations, and what specific tasks they hope GME graduates will be able to
 leverage AI to achieve.

                                                in Africa and employers from other regions hovering near the average.

to say AI is important for current GME graduates.
Employers in the United States and consulting industry are least likely to say AI is currently important.




Some other surveys of employers indicate there is demand for AI skills already taking shape in the labor market. For
example, a recent Amazon Web Services survey found 42 percent of employers are actively searching for talent with AI
development capabilities.1 However, these positions may be largely concentrated in IT or software development functions
rather than the business-oriented roles employers have in mind for GME graduates. Moreover, surveys like these are
seeking responses from all employers—not just those who typically hire graduate business talent.

Unsurprisingly, respondents to GMAC’s survey from the technology industry are most likely to indicate the importance of
AI to current GME graduates compared to employers from other sectors, with 36 percent of them signaling its importance.
Interest was lowest in the consulting, health care and pharmaceutical, and products and services sectors, while interest
among finance and accounting employers was closer to the global average. There are also variations by an organization’s
prominence, with 34 percent of Fortune 100 companies saying AI is important to current GME graduates.

     Some explanations for these organizational preferences may come from the composition
     of the survey sample. For example, employers at staffing firms may be tasked with filling
     specific skills gaps for organizations—and are more likely to value skills like technology/
     IT, AI, or managing human capital compared to recruiters who are used to finding talent on
     business school campuses. Employers who recruit directly from business schools, on the
     other hand, may prioritize a more holistic skillset—reporting higher levels of importance
     for communication, interpersonal, and socio-emotional skills.

     There are also several intuitive explanations as to why artificial intelligence may be more
     important in some organizations or regions over others. Of course, technology companies
     are more reliant on tech-fluent employees across their business functions. Fortune 100
     companies are also much more likely to have the resources to invest in the upfront costs of
     understanding both the technical and business aspects of artificial intelligence.

     While employers are still relatively unconcerned about the current importance of AI skills
     among GME graduates, many predict its significance will grow quite a bit in the future. In
     order to ensure employers were communicating the degree with which they value each
     skill, employers were only able to select three options when asked which skills they think
     will be the most important in the next five years. This means current skill importance and
     future skill importance are not directly comparable, since current skill importance asked
     employers to select all important skills. However, we can still gauge employers’ valuation of
     skills relative to each other by looking at how the skills were ranked in employer responses.

     Figure 2 shows rankings of AI skills in terms of how likely it was to be selected as an
     important skill for current positions, as well as the likelihood of being chosen as one of the
     top three future skills. For example, AI skills were the 21st most likely skill to be selected as
     currently important by Western European employers, but the most likely skill to be selected
     as important in five years. Though U.S. employers ranked AI last on their list of currently
     important skills for GME graduates, it still jumped 16 spots when employers considered its
     future importance—more than the other regions except Western Europe and Africa.

 Understanding the importance of AI to employers is one thing—but
 what exactly do they want GME graduates to be able to do with it? To
 investigate further, we asked employers who indicated AI skills are
 currently important to tell us why. It turns out these employers are
 less concerned about the novelties of generative AI, such as image

 content (Figure 3). Instead, these AI-interested employers see it
 best leveraged as a partner in gaining new skills and developing

 Across industries, consulting employers are more interested than employers from other sectors in problem-solving,
 communication, and strategic thinking skills (Figure 6). Likely due to the client-facing and project-based nature of the work,
 consulting employers also are more likely than employers from other sectors to value time/project management, quantitative
 tasks/data analysis, coachability, and emotional intelligence. Unsurprisingly, employers in the technology sector are most
 likely to value technology/IT skills and artificial intelligence. Two-thirds also value decision-making in current GME graduates,
 which is a much higher share compared to employers in other industries. In addition, tech employers are more likely to value
 global business skills and cross-cultural competence, perhaps related to the internationalization of technology supply chains.

 Because technology skills are quite a broad category of discrete capabilities, we asked the employers who indicated
 technology and IT skills are important for current GME graduates about which specific skills they believe to be important
 (Figure 7). Unlike last year, however, the 2024 survey asked employers to choose only the top three tech skills in order to get

More broadly, technology and IT skills also increased 11 spots
to the top three most important future skills. The takeaway
here is not that every GME graduate also needs to be a software
engineer, but that artificial intelligence and technological
tools are increasingly relevant and relied-upon fixtures of the
future workplace—so those who are leading organizations
must understand how these types of technologies can create
efficiencies and move a business forward.




Figure 10: When asked to select three skills that will be most important in five years,
employers valued AI and technology skills much more than when asked which skills
are currently important.
To compare current and future importance, we examined the rank of which skills employers selected
most often for each question.

     Several other skills that moved up in the ranks reveal
     interesting insights into employers’ thinking about the
     future. For example, grit moved up seven spots while
     adaptability remained in the fifth spot—indicating,
     like last years’ results, the importance that employers
     place on human skills in the future workplace.
     Global business skills—defined as understanding
     international business contexts and being skilled at
     putting this knowledge to use—also moved up six
     spots, reinforcing last year’s survey results that GME
     graduates must be able to function in global contexts.

     Employers across industries are most likely to value
     some combination of problem-solving, strategic
     thinking, and adaptability in future GME graduates
     (Figure 11). Technology and products and services
     employers are more likely to include AI among their
     three most important future skills; finance and
     accounting employers rank it fourth, and consulting
     employers fifth (as explored above). Emotional
     intelligence also ranks toward the top among finance
     and accounting and health care and pharmaceutical
     employers, perhaps related to the needs in each sector
     to build meaningful connections.

 Employers may have grown more confident in business schools related to the changing context in which
 GME is operating and employers are hiring. Notably, the share of employers who say the skills gained
 through GME are more important in today’s world of remote and hybrid working is almost double the
 share who, in 2021, said GME skills are more important following the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 14).
 Even at the peak of work modality disruptions related to the pandemic, just over a third of employers
 thought GME was more relevant in that context. In 2024, about two-thirds now say they value GME skills
 more amid remote and hybrid work. The increase in valuation of these skills is seen across industries,
 regions, and company types, most pronounced in leading Fortune 100 and 500 companies; the finance
 and accounting and manufacturing industries; and in East and Southeast Asia and Western Europe. It is
 likely these types of organizations have undergone the most changes in remote working situations in the
 years following the pandemic, and they are that much more likely to rely on the skills of GME graduates
 to manage this disruption.




 Figure 14: Employers’ appreciation for GME graduates’ skills in today’s remote
 and hybrid work environment is almost twice as common as a similar question
 asked in 2021.
 The surge in appreciation happened across regions, industries, and company types.

The International Monetary Fund projected global inflation to be 5.8 percent in 2024, though revised their
2025 forecast down as inflation fell faster than expected due to still-tight monetary policy and unwinding
supply-side factors.6 According to our respondents, the influence of both inflation and recession is most
potent in Africa and Asia and least so among U.S. employers—perhaps counter to the optimism reflected in
Asian employers’ hiring plans and U.S. employers’ relative conservatism (Figure 21).

Macroeconomic headwinds often have an impact on hiring of international talent. However,
there were no significant year-over-year changes in the share of employers who hired
graduates that required additional legal documentation. Globally, 57 percent of companies
hired this type of international talent in 2023. However, when compared to pre-pandemic
levels in 2018, there has been significant growth in international hiring among global
employers as well as those in Asia and Western Europe (Figure 23).

     Notably, Fortune 100 companies have also
     significantly increased their international hiring
     practices from 54 percent in 2018 to 73 percent
     in 2023. As in past years, the actual hiring of
     international talent increased with the size of an
     organization, likely due to the greater resources and
     in-house infrastructure to process the complexities
     of the required legal documentation.

     In 2024, 39 percent of global employers report
     that they plan to hire international talent, and an
     additional 41 percent are open to the idea but did
     not have active plans when the survey was fielded
     earlier this year (Figure 24). Regionally, employers
     in East and Southeast Asia and Western Europe
     are most likely to—at minimum—be willing to
     hire GME graduates who require additional legal
     documentation. Combined willingness and active
     plans to hire international talent in 2024 is also
     highest in the technology and manufacturing
     sectors.

Overall, the hiring outlook for GME graduates in 2024 is positive, with employers across various industries and
regions planning to expand their hiring of GME talent. While economic factors like inf lation and recession
concerns play a significant role in shaping these decisions, the consistent demand for MBA and specialized business
master’s graduates underscores their value in the modern workforce. Business schools can leverage these trends
by continuing to align their programs with industry needs and fostering partnerships that support continuous
professional development.

 Conclusion
 As business schools evaluate their priorities over the next five years, employers are signaling that their
 ideal GME graduate is trained on the same core skills that have long defined a business education—but
 with a dash of tech literacy and a pinch of interpersonal capabilities. AI is important to the toolkit,
 especially as it relates to its ability to aid in knowledge building and strategic thinking. But like last year,
 the survey results indicate that business schools are largely on track to meet future market demands if
 they continue to focus on how to use problem-solving and strategic thinking skills to thrive in constantly
 changing environments.

 This growing confidence in graduate business school programs—particularly in their ability to produce
 successful, promotable, and well-compensated graduates—underscores the ROI of GME in today's
 evolving workforce. While traditional in-person programs still hold a significant advantage in employer
 perceptions, there is some shift towards recognizing the value of skills gained in online and hybrid
 environments. This trend offers an opportunity for business schools to further educate employers on the
 merits of various educational modalities, ensuring their programs remain relevant and aligned with the
 demands of the modern workplace.

 Of course, corporate confidence in GME is best measured by actual hiring success. Overall, hiring trends
 remain favorable and optimistic across degree types as most employers’ plans signal they are largely
 unfazed by broader economic or political challenges. There are relatively few year-over-year changes in
 non-salary compensation packages, though business schools may have an opportunity to take advantage
 of growing interest in professional development offers—especially as the demand for new technological
 capabilities is continuously balanced against strategic and human skills.

 Ultimately, by working to align business school efforts with industry demands, institutions can position
 themselves as leaders in preparing the next generation of business professionals to navigate and excel in
 an increasingly complex global landscape.
