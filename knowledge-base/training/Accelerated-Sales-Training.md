               What this training will give you
Accelerated sales training will give you an effective selling process that gives you
confidence, closes more sales, and makes selling easy.

From just these few pages today you can:

    •   Learn to close more sales
    •   Achieve consistent sales results
    •   Have great confidence in front of buyers
    •   Know where you are and what to say at all times during the sale
    •   Have an objective for each sales stage which will lead you to the close


All successful sales professionals use a selling process in their face to face meetings with prospects. This
selling process leads their prospects through the sales stages and towards the close. It isn’t a rehearsed
script, it’s a process. A process made up of stages which use a set of techniques to achieve an objective
before moving on to the next stage. In the final stage you close the sale, earn your commission, and grow
our business.

By learning the process you can use your own words, include all your existing sales skills, and adapt your
sales pitch for all types of prospects in all markets and industries.

That means when you have this selling process as your foundation you can use all the sales skills that you
currently have, and all the new ones that you are now going to learn, to make it even more effective.

That’s why we call it Accelerated Sales Training, because you quickly learn a process not a script.




Why this professional sales training works
The sales process that you pick up here has been developed by a working sales manager to help sales people
build a successful career.

These are not classroom techniques that only work in role plays and scenarios. The skills and techniques that
click together to form this sales process have all been tried and tested in real sales situations with real
prospects.

Professional sellers around the world have done exactly what you are doing now. They have bought into this
advanced sales training and are now using the skills and techniques everyday to make a living. It works for
them and it will work for you.
                   SALES-TRAINING-SALES-TIPS.com

The professional sales process
The sales process has 5 stages that take the prospect with you from the first introduction to the
closing of the sale:

    •   Sales Introduction
    •   Sales Questions
    •   Sales Presentation
    •   Closing the Sale
    •   Handing Sales Objections


The 5th stage, handling sales objections, can slot into the process at any place where an objection arises. If
there are no objections then you simply don’t use it.

Do not be fooled by the simplicity of what you see here. Sales training, and how we all sell as professionals,
should not be full of complicated techniques. The simpler the process the easier it is to use, and that’s when
confidence clicks in.

I have seen many sellers try and use techniques that they have been shown on courses and in books that just
don’t work in the real world. Scripted sales pitches, long acronyms to follow, and while they are
concentrating on remembering the next stage they are losing the connection with the buyer.

You can see how easy the basic process above is to remember. Now we add a few key points to each of the
stages, and I mean only a few. Many people that have gone onto successful long term careers have learnt
this process, and the few key elements of each stage, in just a few minutes.

Then they want more, and if you like them want more, we have added some links to each page to show you
where you can get it.

Now let’s start with the first of the sales stages...
                   SALES-TRAINING-SALES-TIPS.com
          The Sales Introduction Stage of the
                    Selling Process
The Sales Introduction is where you should be grabbing the prospect’s attention and
making them want to hear more about what you have to offer.
The introduction is the start of the face to face sale. It may only take a minute to complete but if you get it
wrong you can lose any chance of making the sale. Your introduction also includes a key element of: The
most important line in the sales process, but we’ll come on to that later.

The objectives of the Sales Introduction Stage are: To take hold of the prospect’s attention and to move
smoothly to the next stage of the sales process.




There are five key elements to an effective sales introduction:

    •   Introducing you
    •   Your company or product
    •   The reason you are there
    •   Agreement to the sales agenda
    •   Motivation to move to the next stage




Introducing You
Introducing yourself to a prospect may appear to be simple and straightforward. But in a sales pitch you
should choose every word and sentence and make sure they have the maximum positive impact.

Here are some points to think about:

Is there a way of saying your name that will make it memorable for the prospect.
Do you have a title that will build trust or show you as an expert in your field. e.g. Dr, Professor.

Also consider the sales angle you want to come from. Do you want to be perceived as: warm and friendly,
cold objective and technical, an expert, or as someone with a lot in common with the prospect. You can help
to project your chosen image with how you introduce yourself.
                  SALES-TRAINING-SALES-TIPS.com
Your Company or Product
Straight after introducing themselves most sales people say which company or organisation they are
representing. Again, you should think about the best possible way to introduce your company to the
prospect.

Will the prospect recognise your company’s name, or would they be more familiar with some of their
products. The objective is to quickly build a relationship and to give the prospect information that they
recognize and can use as reference points to perceive the situation.

You may also want to add a potential benefit that your company could deliver to the prospect. This could be
a brief line about what you do, or have done for customers who are similar to the sales prospect you are
with.



The Reason for the Meeting
This is the most important line of the face to face sale. With this one line you will either grab the
attention of the sales prospect or lose their interest and any chance of winning the sale.

Make no mistake, this one line deserves your time and investment to make it as effective as possible. Your
reason for being there must hit the button with the prospect. The real reason you are there is to sell
something, but that is not going to make the prospect want to listen to you. Your reason for being there has
to be a benefit, or a potential benefit, for the prospect. The bigger the benefit, and the more interest and
attention you will get.

You can use a wide ranging general benefit, or a narrow specific benefit based upon what you know about
the person or organisation that you are selling to. You can use a reason for being there that is short and to
the point, or you can use a longer reason, for example a story of how you have benefitted others in a similar
situation to your prospect.

One important point to remember: Your reason for meeting the prospect has to be based upon benefits of
your products or services and not just features.



Agreement to the Agenda
Following your reason for being there you should try and gain agreement to the agenda of the
meeting. You are basically saying to your prospect: I would like to ask you some questions to find out how I
may be of help to you, and then I will present the best proposal to meet your needs. If you like what I show
you are you in a position to buy from me today, or to move to commit to the next stage of your purchasing
process.

Agreeing the agenda for the meeting gives you a lot of information, such as: Is the prospect in a position to
buy from you today, and the organization’s buying process. It also makes your intentions clear to the
prospect and there is no confusion over why you are there.

Gaining commitment to the sales agenda makes it easier to close a sale later on in the sales process.

Motivation to move to the next stage
The final part of the sales introduction is a sales technique that not many people are unfamiliar
with.

The objective is to motivate the prospect to move with you to the next stage of the sales process, the sales
questions stage. Some people go straight into asking questions without any kind of link or motivator to get
the prospect to move with them. When you use a motivator you are giving the prospect a reason to move
forward with you towards closing the sale.

Your motivator can be as simple as: to see if I can give you ...state a benefit... let me ask you a few questions.

This one line may not seem like a big deal but it works as a link to connect the two sales stages. The move
from the sales introduction to the questioning stage can often be where objections and hesitations arise.
Stating a potential benefit as a reason why the prospect should answer your questions can get you past this
vulnerable point in the selling process.




Create an Effective Sales Introduction
As you can see there is a lot more that you can do to make your sales introduction more effective.

Every word and sentence that you use should be carefully chosen to make the most positive impact and
work towards your objective of moving the prospect with you to the next stage of the sales process.

The above are just the key elements that professional sellers use in their introductions. If you want step by
step instructions, and an exercise program, that show you how to create a really effective sales introduction,
then take a look at a sales training course that does exactly that for each stage of the sales process by
opening: http://www.sales-training-sales-tips.com/sales-training-course.html
                   SALES-TRAINING-SALES-TIPS.com
                         Sales Questioning Stage
The sales questioning stage is where you find out the needs, wants, and desires, of
your prospect.

There are three things to remember at this stage of the sale:

1. You must have a structure to your questioning.
2. Make the questions stage as briefly as possible.
3. Questioning should be interactive and not an interrogation.

Your objective in this sales stage is to discover as much information as possible that will help you to form
your sales presentation.




Sales questions structure
You want to get your prospect talking about what is important to them. To do that you should start each
line of questioning with a wide open question. These are questions that start with: Tell me about. Explain to
me. Give me a picture etc.

Follow this with open questions that start with who, what, where, when, and how, to gain more information
and to keep the prospect talking. And then use alternative answer questions to get more specific detail. The
last set of questions in each line of questioning should be closed questions that require a yes or no answer.
Closed questions also gain agreement and commitment from the prospect.




Keep it brief
In your sales introduction you worked hard to grab the attention of the prospect, now you want to keep
their attention by making your questioning stage as brief as possible.

To keep the questioning sales stage brief make a list of all the information that you need from the prospect
in order to form a sales proposal. This is a list of information not a list of questions. You can use this list to
target your wide open questions at specific lines of questioning. This will keep the prospect talking about
the information that is valuable to you.

Always end your sales questions stage by asking if there is anything else, anything that you have missed or
not covered.
                  SALES-TRAINING-SALES-TIPS.com
Question not interrogation
The questioning stage should be a conversation and not an interrogation.

If you ask questions that require short answers, or if you move around from one topic to the other, your
prospect will have to think more about their reply between each question. This soon becomes tedious and
uncomfortable. Your prospect will soon lose interest and start thinking of objections to end the meeting
early.

Make your prospect feel comfortable, let them know you are interested in them, and have a conversation
with them. Using the above sales questioning structure, follow each topic from a wide open question and
through the structure to a closed question where you gain agreement or confirmation.




An effective questioning structure leads to more closed sales
Asking questions is a sales skill that professionals build up with good sales training and developing
their techniques in real sales situations

There is much more that can be added to the sales questions stage of the sales process. For example:
Prospect will answer wide open questions with what is most important to them first. There is a way that you
can use this to your benefit.

There are also other types of questions that will help you to close more sales. For example: Dissatisfaction
questions will tell you what the customer doesn’t like about their current products or services.

To build up your sales questioning skills, and to find out how to use other questioning techniques, use the
sales training course that has been developed by working sales professionals:



                                  The Complete Training Course to add to the advanced sales training

                Sales Presentation Techniques
The sales presentation, and the closing of the sale, is what all the other stages have
been leading up to.
From the very first actions where you identified the prospect as a potential buyer, took that incoming call, or
made your first sales appointment call to them, the objective was to get in front of the buyer with enough
information to present a sales proposal and close the sale.

Your aim now is to successfully complete that objective.


To help you to do that, use these 3 proven professional presentation techniques:

    •   Present what is important to the customer.
    •   The prospect wants benefits not features.
    •   Make a trial close part of your sales presentation.




Present what is important to the customer
When the prospect answered your sales questions in the previous stage they will have answered with what
is most important to them first.

So if you asked them an open question with no, or little, direction to a specific product feature, and they
responded by telling you about price, budgets, or running cost, you will know that these are important to the
prospect.

At the sales presentation stage you should present the product features and benefits to the customer in the
same order that they gave them to you in the sales questions stage. So using the above example you would
first present the benefits of your product or service that relate to price, budgets, or running costs.

If you have a good professional sales questions stage in your selling process the prospect will write your sales
presentation for you. They will tell you what they need, want, and desire, and give you the order of
importance of those requirements.
                   SALES-TRAINING-SALES-TIPS.com
The prospect wants benefits not features
Every salesperson that I meet tells me that they fully understand features and benefits and how to
use them in the sales process.

You only have to listen to the sales pitches of people trying to sell to you to know that many people still try
to sell the features of a product or service and not the benefits. Buyers want benefits not features.

A feature is just something that your product has or does.

The benefits are what the buyer gains from the features.

The safety features of a new car, such as seatbelts and air bags, are only the features. People do not buy
cars because they want seat belts and air bags. They buy cars with safety features because they want the
benefits that these features will give them and their families. They want to know that they will be safe.

Present the benefits that your products and services offer that meet the needs the prospect disclosed in the
questions stage.




The trial close
The end of the sales presentation should flow smoothly into the closing stage of the sales process.

At the end of your presentation summarise the benefits that you have presented and how they match the
requirements that the prospect stated in the sales questions stage. Check that the prospect agrees with you
and that you have covered everything, and then use a trial close.

A trial close is a way of asking the prospect if they are going to buy from you without asking them if they will
buy from you.

You want to know if you have met all the requirements that they gave you in the sales questions stage and
you want an indication that they are happy to go ahead.

You do not want to say to them, that you have presented everything that your product or service can offer
and you now want a yes or no answer. With the trial close you are asking if there is anything else they need
to know, and if there is anything stopping them from going ahead with the purchase.

A positive response to a trial close means that you can move to the next stage and close the sale.

A negative or non positive response means that there is a sales objection or a barrier to closing the sale still
to be overcome. This could be a need that the prospect has, viewed from their perspective, which has not
been met. When this happens you should move to the sales objection handling stage of the sales process.
                  SALES-TRAINING-SALES-TIPS.com
Delivering a great sales presentation
To deliver a great sales presentation you need to present it with confidence.

This confidence comes from being able to match the features of your product or service to the benefits that
will sell it to the customer. There is a great course, which you will not see anywhere else, that shows you a
fun way to link a buyer’s needs to features and benefits, and then use the same link in the closing of the sale.


                                     The course is free and has been downloaded by sales people
                                     across the world.

                                     to quickly learn product knowledge and match features to

 Closing the Sale and Earning Your Reward
In Professional Selling closing the sale is not a linguistic trick, or a bullying tactic, and it doesn’t only
happen at the end of a sale.

When you have an effective sales process, with good ethical techniques at each of the sales stages, closing
becomes a simple question that confirms what you already know.

If you have to depend upon tricking the customer into signing the contract or handing over the money, there
are weaknesses in the earlier stages of your sales pitch. Unethical closing practices will not lead to long term
success. You only have to look at some of the industries that have suffered from the effects of unethical,
and sometimes illegal, sales closing techniques:

Time share vacation sales, door to door energy supplier sales, and the major banks, have all been featured in
the press and media for their selling practices and have suffered the consequences.




Closing the sale starts at the introduction stage
Ethical sales professionals, and people that want to grow their business with good customer service and
referral sales, use their skills to start closing the sale right from the introduction stage.

When you gain commitment from the prospect, to the agenda for your sales meeting, you are starting to
close the sale. At each stage of the sales process you are building, and adding to, the commitment from the
customer towards making the purchase.

By the time you have completed your sales presentation and gained commitment throughout, and used a
trial close, you will know if there are any objections or obstacles that will prevent you closing the sale. That
means you can use a simple question to confirm the sale. The wording of this question can work to give the
prospect that small amount of additional motivation needed and to gain their full commitment to the sale.

You may think that the other stages of your sales process are working well for you but your closing is letting
you down. This can often be the case. With some investment into your closing skills you can soon increase
your sales results and your rewards.

It could be one small change that is needed to make your sales pitch click together and become more
effective. Maybe you are not closing the sale from the start by gaining agreement from the prospect. Or
perhaps your sales presentation does not flow smoothly into a trial close and the buyer senses there is a big
step or a decision.

I have helped many sales people to make a small change to their closing techniques and that has made a
massive difference to their results. The training and coaching I used to do this is now available to you.

                  Overcoming Sales Objections
Overcoming sales objections is a stage of the sales process that you use at any time during the sale
to overcome obstacles and get the meeting with your prospect back on track.

Many people new to selling, or without the benefits of professional sales training, answer all objections as
soon as they arise without discovering the true objection from the prospect’s perspective. To handle sales
objections, and close more sales, there are skills and techniques that professional sales people have
developed and proven in real sales situations.

Like all professional sales skills the objection handling techniques must be easy to learn and use, and follow a
process that will work in all marketplaces and types of sales.


Here’s a quick and easy sales objection process that you can start using today to increase your sales
results:

1. Define the obstacle to the sale
2. Gain agreement to the definition
3. Present the solution
4. Close the sale

A simple and easy to use process for overcoming objections. Learn to use this process and then and all your
current objection handling skills, and the new skills that you learn today, on to these four simple steps.




Define the obstacle to the sale
Define the objection to the sale from the buyer’s viewpoint, and remember their objection may not exist in
the real world, but it is still real to them and will stop the sale.

An objection can be based on real or false evidence. It can exist in the beliefs and internal pictures and self
talk of the prospect and sit firmly on their internal map of reality. Or, it can be found in the real world where
the prospect has a real need that the sales presentation hasn’t met.

You cannot overcome the objection until you know the beliefs that support it, and where it exists. To do this
you need to question the prospect and clearly define the sales objection.
                  SALES-TRAINING-SALES-TIPS.com
Gain agreement to the definition
An important step, and one which many sales people miss out, is to gain agreement that you have clearly
identified the prospect’s concerns.

You want to make sure you are answering the real objection, as framed by the buyer, and you also want to
make sure it is the only objection stopping the sale. You should also re-frame the buyer’s perception of the
sales objections so that you can offer a positive benefit to overcome it.

Here’s an example:

If a buyer tells you that they don’t want a poor service you can turn this into what they do want. Then show
evidence that your company can provide an excellent service.

If they don’t want a product that breaks down, you re-phrase the objections as: You need a product with
proven reliability.

It is always easier to sell to a positive need rather than a negative the buyer doesn’t want.

I hope that what you have seen in just the first two steps of the objection handling process will stop you
from making the common mistake of responding to objections with a rehearsed line, or a practiced rebuttal.
The first step is to define the objection, and the second one is to gain agreement that you have defined it
correctly.

Present the solution
You have defined the objection, and gained agreement to the definition and to there being no more
objections stopping the sale.

Now you present your solution and answer the objections. You use features to show the benefits the buyer
will gain by doing business with you.

Only present the benefits that will handle the objection. Answer the problems the buyer sees, even if they
are based on false evidence or beliefs.

Close the sale
Now you can close the sale, or gain agreement to the next stage of the sale.

There is no need for trick closes or manipulation techniques. You earlier gained agreement that you had
defined the objection, and that there were no more sales objections preventing a sale. That is where the
main closing took place.

You have presented an answer to the objection that shows the buyer the benefits that will turn the
objection into a sale, from their viewpoint. Now all you need to do is use a gentle question to gain their
agreement to the sale.
                   SALES-TRAINING-SALES-TIPS.com
The last two steps are very similar to the corresponding stages of the selling process, the sales presentation
and closing the sale. All the presentation skills and closing techniques that you would use in the sales
process can be utilised when overcoming objections.



There is much more that you can add to your sales process
Learn to use this simple sales objection handling process and then add more advanced techniques
that will help you to overcome more objections and close more sales.

Sales objections can be the stage of a sale that sellers find the most difficult. It doesn’t have to be like that.
Objection handling is just another sales stage with key elements that need to be learned and used. If you
want to increase your objection handling skills take a look at the professional course I use with my sales
teams:



How to Overcome Sales Objections

Think about it, where do you lose a sales prospect?
Mostly you lose sales as you try and move from one stage of your sales pitch to the next. As you try and
move from the sales introduction to the sales questions, or after asking your questions as you go forward to
the sales presentation.

As a working sales manager I see sales getting stopped as the seller finishes their presentation and tries to
move to closing the sale. The jump is too much and it stops the buyer from moving with you.

The free sales techniques in this eBook will show what to say to motivate and move your buyer along with
you. It makes your sales pitch flow from one stage to the next, motivating & connecting each part of the
sale.
