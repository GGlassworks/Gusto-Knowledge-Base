                     INTRODUCTION TO HRM
An organization is made up of 4 resources Men –Living, Material, Money and Machinery. It is
the human that makes use of non -human resources.

Definitions:
          “The field of management which has to do with planning, organizing, directing, and
           controlling the functions of procuring, developing, maintaining and utilizing a labor
           force” [procure, develop and maintain].

          Process of making the efficient and effective use of Human Resources so that the set
           goals are achieved”.

          “Personnel management or say HRM is the planning, organizing, directing or
           controlling of the procurement, development, compensation, integration, maintenance
           & separation of HR to the end that individual, organizational & social objectives are
           achieved.” - Flippo

          “From the national point of view, HR‟s are Knowledge, skills, creative abilities,
           talents and attitude obtained in the population”. -Leon C. Megginson

Evolution of the Personnel Function:
   The Commodity concept: Labour as commodity to be bought and sold. Wages based on
   demand and supply. Government did very little to protect workers

   The Factor of Production concept: Labour any other factor of production, Workers are like
   machine tools.

   The Goodwill concept: Welfare measures like safety, first aid, lunch room, rest room will
   have a positive impact on workers‟ productivity

   The Paternalistic concept/ Paternalism: Management must assume a fatherly and
   protective attitude towards employees. Paternalism does not mean merely providing benefits
   but it means satisfying various needs of the employees as parents meet the requirements of
   the children.

   The Humanitarian concept: To improve productivity, physical, social and psychological
   needs of workers must be met. As Mayo and others stated, money is less a factor in
   determining output, than group standards, group incentives and security. The organization is
   a social system that has both economic and social dimensions.

   The Human Resource concept: Employees are the most valuable assets of an organization.
   There should be a conscious effort to realize organizational goals by satisfying needs and
   aspirations of employees.

   The Emerging concept: Employees should be accepted as partners in the progress of a
   company. They should have a feeling that the organization is their own. To this end,
   managers must offer better quality of working life and offer opportunities to people to exploit
   their potential fully. The focus should be on Human Resource Development.

Importance and Role of HRM:
    L. F. Urwick had remarked that “Business houses are made or broken in the long run not
     by markets or capital, patents or equipments, but by men.”

    Peter F. Drucker says “Men, of all the resources available to man, can grow and
     develop.”

Now a day‟s HR‟s considered as Human Capital, which can be classified into 3 categories

   1. Intellectual Capital: specialized knowledge, tacit knowledge and skills, cognitive
      complexity, and learning capacity.
   2. Social Capital: Social capital -network of relationships, sociability and trustworthiness.
   3. Emotional Capital: Self confidence, ambition & courage, risk bearing ability & resilience.

JOB DESIGN:
   Job Design (work design or task design) is deciding the contents of a job.

    It fixes the duties and responsibilities of the job, the methods of doing the job and the
     relationships between the job holder (manager) and his superiors, subordinates and
     colleagues.

    JD also gives information about the qualifications required for doing the job and the
     reward (financial and non-financial benefits) for doing the job.




MRCET MBA
    JD mostly done for managers' jobs.

    While designing the job, the needs of the organisation and the needs of the individual
     manager must be balanced.



    Needs of the organisation include high productivity, quality of work, etc

    Needs of individual managers include job satisfaction That is, they want the job to be
     interesting and challenging. Jobs must not be made highly specialized because they lead
     to boredom

Importance of Job Design
        JD is a very important function of staffing.
        If the jobs are designed properly, then highly efficient managers will join the
         organisation.
        They will be motivated to improve the productivity and profitability of the
         organisation.
        If the jobs are designed badly, then it will result in absenteeism, high labour turnover,
         conflicts, and other labour problems.

Factors Affecting Job Design
1. Proper scope of job

        The scope of the job should be proper.
        If the scope is narrow (less), then the job will not be challenging.
        It will not give an opportunity for development.
        If the scope is very wide, then the manager will not be able to handle it properly. This
         will cause stress, frustration and loss of control.
        Therefore, scope of the job must be balanced and proper.

2. Full-time challenge of the job

        So that it takes up the full-time and effort of the manager.

        If not, the manager will have a lot of free time.

        He will use this free time to interfere in the work of his subordinates.

3. Managerial skills




MRCET MBA
    All managers do not have equal skills.
    So jobs should be designed after considering the skills of the manager.
    A manager having a high level of skill should be given very challenging jobs while a
     manager having a low level of skill should be given fewer challenging jobs



4. Organization’s requirements

         Jobs must be designed according to the requirements of the organisation.

5. Individual likes and dislikes

         Some people like to work alone while some people prefer to work in groups.

         So, individual likes and dislikes must be considered while designing the job.

6. Organizational structure

        Organizational structure also affects the job design. Individual jobs must fit into the
         organization‟s structure.

7. Technology

        The level of technology used by the organisation also affects the job design.

        An organisation having a high level of technology will have different job designs
         compared to an organisation having a low level of technology.

                    RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION


Recruitment:
The Recruitment and Selection belongs to value added HR Processes. The recruitment is about
the ability of the organization to source new employees, keeps the organization operating and
improving the quality of the human capital employed in the company. The quality of the
recruitment process is the main driver for the satisfaction of managers with the services provided
by Human Resources.

 Recruitment can be defined as searching for and obtaining a pool of potential candidates with
the desired knowledge, skills and experience to allow an organisation to select the most
appropriate people to fill job vacancies against defined position descriptions and specifications.

The purpose of the recruitment process is to find the widest pool of applicants to provide the
greatest opportunity to select the best people for the required roles in an organisation.

Acquiring the best applicants for a role can be a competitive advantage for an organisation
whereas ineffective recruitment and selection can result in enormous disruption, reduced
productivity, interpersonal difficulties and interruptions to operations, customer service and long
term costs.

Selection:

Once a pool of candidates has been identified through the recruitment process the most
appropriate candidate, or candidates are identified through a selection process including but not
limited to interviewing, reference checking and testing. The purpose of the selection process is
to ensure that the best person or people are appointed to the role or roles using effective, fair and
equitable assessment activities.

Factors Effecting Recruitment and Selection Process

Recruitment and Selection Process is supported by a standard & permanent process of screening.
However in some cases the screening process cannot simplify the selection process because there
are certain other factors that influence the selection process. These factors are the environmental
factors & are as follow.




MRCET MBA
   1. Legal Considerations: Human Resource Management is influenced by the court
      decisions, executive orders & legislation. The management of the organization should use
      the legally defensive selection tools in the selection process.
   2. Speed of Decision Making: The recruitment and selection process is directly influenced
      by the available time to make the decision of selection. In general cases the selection
      process is followed by the specified policies & procedures to protect the organization
      from legal issues. But in certain situations there is much pressure on the organization that
      leads the management to follow the exceptional selection process.
   3. Organizational Hierarchy: Recruitment and selection process varies according to the
      filling posts of different levels of hierarchy in the organizational structure.
   4. Applicant Pool: The recruitment and selection process is also influenced by the number
      of applicants for a particular job. In case of many qualified applicants for a particular
      post, the selection process becomes selective. For this purpose, selection ratio is
      ascertained by comparing the number of selected applicants to the number of applicants
      in a pool.
   5. Type of Organization: The type of the organization like government organization,
      private or non-profit organization etc, also affects the selection process for the hiring
      individuals.
   6. Probationary Period: Certain organization adopts the procedure of probation period in
      the selection process to check the potential of the individual on the basis of his
      performance. This may take the form of either validity check on the selection process or
      as a substitute of some steps of the selection process.
   7. Selection Criteria: In most of the cases the applicants are selected on the basis of
      following factors or criterion.
       Education
       Competence
       Experience
       Skills & Abilities
       Personal Characteristics

In way the applicant that best fits the above criterion is selected rather than the one that has
extraordinary skills or over as well as under qualified because in such case the later selected
person would not properly adjust in the organization.

Steps Involved in Recruitment and Selection Process in HRM

In typical cases, the selection process starts with the preliminary interview after which the
applications for the employment are filled by the candidates. The candidates pass through a
number of selection tests, interviews of employment and background check & references. The
candidates that are successful in all the previous steps get physical examination test by the



MRCET MBA
company and if the results are satisfactory, they are selected. There are several internal &
external forces that influence the selection process & therefore the managers must consider these
factors before making a final decision of selection.

Following are the standardized steps of the selection process but some organizations may alter
some of these steps in their selection process.

           1.   Initial Screening
           2.   Application blank
           3.   Pre-employment Testing
           4.   Interview
           5.   Background Checks
           6.   Conditional Job Offer
           7.   Drug Test/Medical Exam
           8.   Final Selection Decision

Now each step is discussed one by one.

1. Initial Screening:

Generally the Selection and the Recruitment Process starts with the initial screening of applicants
so that the unqualified ones are drop out at the initial stage. Initial screening is helpful to save the
time, cost & effort of the selection committee in the following steps of the selection process. In
this step certain general questions are asked from the applicants. There are chances that the some
applicants would be unqualified for the job but some of them would be qualified. So the main
purpose of screening of applicants is to reduce the number of applicants available in the selection
process.

Sources used in the Screening Effort

The main source of initial screening is the curriculum vitae of the applicant along with the job
application. Following information is included in the above mentioned documents.

      Education & employment History
      Evaluation of character
      Evaluation of job performance

Screening Interviews

Screening interviews are employed to




MRCET MBA
      To verify the accuracy & validity of the information given in the curriculum vitae of the
       applicant.
      The duration of these interviews is quite short.

Advantages of Successful Screening

When the initial screening step become successful, the removing applicants don not proceed to
the next step of the selection process because they do not meet the minimum requirements.
Secondly the selection costs of the organization are much reduced through proper screening of
the applicants.

2. Application Blank

The person‟s application for employment is formally recorded in the shape of application blank.
In the next step of the selection process, an application form for the employment is completed by
the prospective applicant. The information contained in the application blank differ from one
organization to another organization and in job posts, it may vary even within the same
organization. But generally the informational needs and the requirements of EEO are covered in
the application blank. The historical data from the candidate can be quickly collected through the
application blanks so that further verification about the accuracy of the data is carried out.


3. Pre-employment Test

The physical & mental abilities, knowledge, skills, personal characteristics & other aspects of
behavior can be effectively measured through the pre-employment tests. For this purpose there
are hundreds of test that can measure the different aspects of human behavior. With the passage
of time, the application of pre-employment test is growing at a fast rate in the selection process
because they can explain the qualities & skills of applicant clearly. These tests are more used in
the large & public sector organizations.

The advantage of application of tests in the selection process is that it can ensure the potential &
qualified candidate selection from a pool of applicants for a job.

Characteristics of Well Designed Test

A well designed selection test has the following characteristics.

      Standardization
      Objectivity
      Norms



MRCET MBA
      Reliability
      Validity

4. Job Interviews

In the interview, the interviewer & applicant exchange information in order to achieve a goal
through conversation. The employment interviews are conducted during the selection process
through proper planning. The pleasant location of the interviewing place is selected and the
interviewer has the good personality with empathy & ability to communicate & listen effectively.
A job profile must be prepared on the basis of job description before conducting interview.

Contents of the Interview

Although the contents of the employment interview varies from one organization to another &
also according to the nature of job but still following are the essential contents of the interview.

         Occupational Experience
         Academic Achievement
         Interpersonal Skills
         Personal Qualities
         Organizational Fit

Types of Interviews

The interviews are generally categorized into the following three types.

1. Unstructured Interview: In unstructured interviews open ended questions are asked from the
applicant in order to perform probing. It is generally non-directive in nature and applicant is encouraged
to give lengthy answers.

2. Structured Interview: In structured interview, a list of job related questions associated to
particular job are asked from each applicant in a consistent manner. It is directive or patterned in nature
and includes the following four kinds of questions.

         Situational Questions
         Job Knowledge Questions
         Job-sample simulation Questions
         Worker Requirement Questions

3. Mixed Interview: It is a special kind of structured interview in which specially designed questions
are asked from the applicant to probe his past behavior in specific situations. It does not include the self-
evaluative & hypothetical questions & inhibits to judge the personality of the applicant. The candidates
are rated on the basis of their responses in the light of the bench-marked answer of successful
employees.



MRCET MBA
Methods of Interviewing

Following are the main ways of conducting interviews.

   a.   One-on-One Interview
   b.   Group Interview
   c.   Board Interview
   d.   Stress Interview

5. Back Ground Checks

The accuracy of the application form of the candidate is verified through references & former
employer. The educational, criminal record & legal status to work are verified. Personal
references of applicant are contacted to confirm the validity & accuracy of the provided
information. Effort is made to know the past behavior of the employees to that the future
behavior can be predicted from it. Background checks assist the selection committee in dropping
the applicants that have past insubordination issues, attendance problem, theft or special
behavioral problems. The level of responsibility of the new job directs the intensity of the
background investigation.

6. Conditional Job Offer

After going through all the previous steps of selection process, there comes the most important
step of the selection process in which the decision of hiring is made. The applicant that best
meets the requirements of the job is selected. At start conditional job letter is issued which must
be followed by medical exam.

7. Medical Exam

When the conditional job letter is issued the next step of the selection process starts in which the
physical/medical examination of the selected candidate is conducted. The medical exam of the
candidate is essential to check either he takes the drugs or not. If he passes the exam, he would
be finally selected for the job.

8. Final Selection Decision

After passing the medical exam by the candidate, the final offer for the job is made to the
candidate by the relative department.

                                     INDUCTION

Definition

Induction is the process of introducing a new employee to the company culture and processes
with the aim of bringing them up to speed as quickly as possible as well as making them feel
socially comfortable and aware of their professional responsibilities. Companies will typically
have an induction programme in place and follow the same processes for all new hires, although
the induction process is may vary depending on the industry, the job role and the seniority of the
new hire.

Induction is technically synonymous to on boarding, although on boarding is typically the term
used when describing a more complex process with a greater emphasis on the social side.
Inductions are also likely to be time-limited, such as a week or two, whereas on boarding is
commonly seen as a long-term, logical process to integrate a new hire with an organization‟s
values.

                              PLACEMENT

After an employee has been hired and oriented, he or she must be placed in his/her right job.

Placement is understood as the allocation of people to jobs. It is the assignment or re-assignment
of an employee to a new employee to a new or different job.

Placement includes initial assignment of new employees and promotion, transfer or demotion of
present employees. Where the jobs are sequential or pooled, HR specialists must use assessment
classification model for placing newly hired employees.

                   HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT
HRD is the part of HRM that specifically deals with T&D of the employees in the organization.

HRD includes training a person after he or she is first hired, providing opportunities to learn new
skills, distributing resources that are beneficial for the employee's tasks, and any other
developmental activities.

HRD concept was first introduced by Leonard Nadler in 1969 in a conference in US. He defined
HRD as “those learning experience which are organized, for a specific time, and designed to
bring about the possibility of behavioral change”.

According to M.M. Khan,

"HRD is the across of increasing knowledge, capabilities and positive work attitudes of all
people working at all levels in a business undertaking."

Focus- Developing the most superior workforce so that the org.& individual employees can
accomplish their work goals in service to customers.

HRD can be formal such as in classroom training, a college course, or an organizational planned
change effort. Informal HRD includes employee coaching by a manager.

Difference between HRD and HRM:

Current/Future Ones

   1. Management by objective[MBO]

   2. 360o Feedback Method

   3. Psychological Appraisals

   4. Assessment Centre

Earlier/ Traditional methods
1. Rating Scale: It consists of several numerical scales, each representing a job related
performance criterion such as dependability, initiative, output, attendance, attitude, co-operation
and the like.

2. Confidential Report: Descriptive report prepared by the employee‟s immediate supervisor.
The report highlights the strengths and weaknesses of employees. It is prepared in Government
organizations. Does not offer any feedback to the employee

3. Essay Evaluation Method: The rater is asked to express the strong as well as weak points of
employee‟s Behavior.

The Rater considers the Employee’s:

        Job knowledge and potential
        Understanding of company‟s programs, policies, objectives etc
        Relation with co-workers and supervisors
        Planning, organizing and controlling ability


MRCET MBA
        Attitude and perception

Essay Evaluation method has the following limitations:

        Highly subjective
        Supervisor may write biased essay
        Difficult to find effective writers
        A busy appraiser may write the essay hurriedly without assessing properly the actual
         performance of the worker
        If the appraiser takes a long time it becomes uneconomical from the view point of the
         firm

4. Critical Incident Technique: Manager prepares very effective and ineffective behavior of an
employee.

    They represent the outstanding or poor behavior of the employees.

    Periodically records critical incidents of employee‟s behavior,e.g.,

           •   June 21 - Sales clerk patiently attended to the customer‟s complaint. He     is
               polite, prompt, enthusiastic in solving the customers‟ problem

           •   June 21 - The sales assistant stayed 45 minutes beyond his break during the
               busiest part of the day. He failed to answer store manager‟s call thrice. He is
               lazy, negligent, stubborn and uninterested in work.

Ex: A fire, sudden breakdown, accident

Workers              Reaction                           Scale

  A            Informed the supervisor immediately        4

  B            Become anxious on loss of output           3

  C             Tried to repair the machine               2

  D.           Complained for poor maintenance             1

Critical Incident Technique –Negative Points

          Negative incidents may be more noticeable than positive incidents.
          Results in very close supervision which may not be liked by the employee.
          The recording of incidents is a chore for the supervisor concerned who may be too
           busy or forget to do it.

5. Checklist: List of statements-on Job Performance of Employees.

          BARS represent a range of descriptive statements of behavior varying from the least
           to the most effective
          Rater indicates which behavior on each scale best describes an employee‟s
           performance

Training process:
4 Step Training Process:

   1. Assessment of training Needs

   2. Instructional design for training

   3. Implement of the training program

   4. Evaluation of the results

1. Assessment of training Needs or Training Need Analysis (TNA)

TNA is “the process of identifying training needs in an organization for the purpose of
improving employee job performance”.

            Today's work environment requires employees to be skilled in performing
             complex tasks in an efficient, cost-effective, and safe manner. It is needed when
             employees are not performing up to a certain standard or at an expected level of
             performance
            The identification of training needs is the first step in a uniform method of
             instructional design.
            A successful TNA will identify those who need training and what kind of training
             is needed.
            A TNA helps to put the training resources to good use.

Types of Needs Analyses

Many Needs Assessments are available. Sources that can in determining which needs analysis is
appropriate are described below.

a. Organizational Analysis.

        Analysis of the business needs or other reasons the training is desired.
        Analysis of the organization's strategies, goals, and objectives. Knowing what is the
         organization overall trying to accomplish.

        Analysis dealing with potential participants and instructors involved in the process.
        What is their learning style, and who will conduct the training.
        Do the employees have required skills?
        Are there changes to policies, procedures, software, or equipment that require or
         necessitate training?

C. Work analysis / Task Analysis.

        Analysis of the tasks being performed.
        This is an analysis of the job and the requirements for performing the work.
        Also known as a task analysis or job analysis, this analysis seeks to specify the main
         duties and skill level required.
        This helps ensure that the training which is developed will include relevant links to
         the content of the job.

D. Performance Analysis.

        Are the employees performing up to the established standard?
        If performance is below expectations, can training help to improve this performance?
        Is there a Performance Gap?

E. Content Analysis.

        Analysis of documents, laws, procedures used on the job.
        This analysis answers questions about what knowledge or information is used on this
         job.
        This information comes from manuals, documents, or regulations.
        It is important that the content of the training does not conflict or contradict job
         requirements.

F. Training Suitability Analysis.

        Analysis of whether training is the desired solution.
        One but May not always be the best solution.
        Whether training will be effective in its usage.

   G. Cost-Benefit Analysis.

        Analysis of the return on investment (ROI) of training.
        Effective training results in a return of value to the organization that is greater than
         the initial investment to produce or administer the training.

        Monitoring the progress of trainees.

4. Training Effectiveness/Evaluation

Donald Kirkpatrick, Professor Emeritus at the University of Wisconsin and past president of the
American Society for Training and Development (ASTD), first published his Four-Level
Training Evaluation Model in 1959, in the US Training and Development Journal.

The model was then updated in 1975, and again in 1994, when he published his best-known
work, "Evaluating Training Programs."



MRCET MBA
The four levels are:

    1. Reaction.

    2. Learning.

    3. Behavior.

    4. Results.

Let's look at each level in greater detail

Level 1: Reaction

         How trainees (the people being trained), reacted to the training.
         Helps to understand how well the training was received by the audience.
         Helps to improve the training for future trainees, including identifying important
          areas or topics that are missing from the training.

Level 2: Learning

         What trainees have learned [learning objectives].
         How much has their knowledge increased as a result of the training?
         Knowing what they learnt and what they aren't will help you improve future training.

Level 3: Behavior

         How far trainees have changed their behavior, based on the training they received.
         How trainees apply the information.
         Just because behavior hasn't changed, it doesn't mean that trainees haven't learned
          anything [boss won't let them apply/ no desire to apply the knowledge themselves].

MRCET MBA
Components of IR system
An industrial relations system is made up of certain institutions, which are popularly known as
„three actors” of the system.

1. Workers and their Organization: When the bulk of workforce is employed in the production
of goods and services, the relations between them impersonal and dehumanized. Further, if they
are forced to work in an alienated, monotonous, unhygienic work environment where t heir
activities are closely regulated and controlled by the managerial personnel, their dissatisfaction
with system forces them to revolt against it, so workers form their unions.

2. The employers and their Organisations: Management: The employer/management is the
key factor in the system of IR around which the whole process revolves. As they not only
provide jobs to workers but also lay down the terms and conditions of their employment,
administer various social security and labor welfare program over and above managing various
aspects of industries that directly or indirectly influence the total system.

3. The Government: In the system of industrial relations, government acts as a regulator and
judge. Till 19th century, the Government almost everywhere including India adopted a policy of
laissez faire, i.e. it did not bother to intervene between the employer and workers‟ problems .As
such, and parties were left free to settle the score the way they liked to combine for a common
cause-for protest against the inhuman conditions. Government attitude changed in the end of the
19th century, The Government was constrained to bring in some type of protective legislation
relating to conditions of work etc.




These three actors in the system interact with each other to yield the basic output.




MRCET MBA
TRADE UNION
“A trade union is a combination of persons whether temporary or permanent, primarily for the
purpose of regulating the relations between workers and employers or between workers for
imposing restrictive conditions on the conduct of any trade or business and includes the
federations of two or more trade unions.

As per Sec. 2 (6) Trade Unions Act, 1926-“A Trade Union is an organisation of workers, acting
collectively, who seek to protect and promote their mutual interests through collective
bargaining”.

Objectives of Trade Unions
1. Ensure Security of Workers: This involves continued employment of workers, prevent
retrenchment, and lay off or lock-outs. Restrict application of “fire” or dismissal or discharge and
VRS.

2. Obtain Better Economic Returns: This involves wages hike at periodic intervals, bonus at
higher rate, other admissible allowances, subsidized canteen and transport facilities.

3. Secure Power to Influence Management: This involves workers‟ participation in
management, decision making, role of union in policy decisions affecting workers, and staff
members.

4. Secure Power To Influence Government: This involves influence on government to pass
labour legislation which improves working conditions, safety, welfare, security and retirement
benefits of workers and their dependents, seek redressal of grievances as and when needed.

Functions of a Trade Union:

The important basic functions of unions listed by National Commission on labour are:

    To secure fair wages to workers.
    To safeguard security of tenure and improve conditions of service.
    To enlarge opportunities for promotion and training.
    To improve working and living conditions.
    To provide for educational, cultural and recreational facilities.
    To co-operate in and facilitate technological advance by broadening the understanding of
     workers on its underlying issues.
    To promote identity of interests of workers with their industry.




MRCET MBA
    To offer responsive co-operation in improving levels of production and productivity,
     discipline and high standards of quality and
    To promote individual and collective welfare.

Shortcomings of Trade Unions:

Trade union movement in our country suffers from the following weaknesses:

1. Uneven Growth: Trade unions are concentrated in large scale industry sector and in big
industrial centers. There is very little trade union activity in small sector, agricultural labour and
domestic sector. Trade unionism has touched only a portion of the working class in India.

2. Small Size: Most of the unions have low membership though the number of unions and union
membership are increasing, average membership is inadequate.

3. Weak Financial Position: The average yearly income of unions is very low and inadequate.
The subscription rates are low and many members do not pay the subscription in time. Due to
their financial weakness, most of the unions are not in a position to undertake welfare
programmes for workers.

4. Political Leadership: Trade unions are under the leadership and control of political parties
and outsiders. Politicians exploit unions and workers for their personal and political gains. Thus,
the political leadership is very harmful to the trade union movement in India.

5. Multiplicity of Unions: There exist several unions in the same establishment or industry. The
existence of rival unions with conflicting ideology is greatly responsible for unhealthy growth of
trade union movement. In some cases employers encourage split in unions to undermine their
bargaining power.

6. Problem of Recognition: Employers are under no obligation to give recognition to any union.

7. Absence of Paid Office-Bearers: Most of the unions do not have Hill-time paid office-
bearers. Union activists working on honorary basis devote only limited time and energy to union
activities. Union officers lack adequate knowledge and skill due to lack of proper training, weak
financial position and political leadership are the main reasons for this state of affairs.

8. Apathy of Members: Majority of workers do not take keen interest in union activities. The
attendance at the general meetings of unions is very poor.

9. Opposition from Employers: Trade unions in India have to face opposition from employers.
Many employers try to intimidate or victimise labour leaders, start rival union and bribe union
officials.



MRCET MBA
10. Inter-Union Rivalry: Multiple unions create rivalry. Unions try to play down each other in
order to gain greater influence among workers. Employers take advantage of infighting. Inter-
union rivalry weakens the power of collective bargaining and reduces the effectiveness of
workers in securing their legitimate rights.

INDUSTRIAL DISPUTES
Industrial dispute means any dispute of difference between employees and employers or between
employers and workmen or between workmen and workmen, which is connected with the
employment or non-employment of the terms of employment or the conditions of work of any
person (The industrial Disputes Act 1947, Section 2K).

Every human being (say a labour) has certain requirements/needs e.g., economic needs, social
needs, security requirements. When these requirements do not get satisfied, there arises a conflict
between the worker and the capitalist/employer.

The common causes of industrial disputes are as follows:
1. Psychological Causes:

    Authoritarian leadership (nature of administration).
    Clash of personalities.
    Difficulty in adjusting in given conditions or with each other (employee and employer).
    Strict discipline.
    Demand for self-respect and recognition by workers.

2. Institutional Causes:

    Non recognition of trade/labour union by the management.
    Matters of collective bargaining.
    Unfair conditions and practices.
    Pressure on workers to avoid participation in trade unions.

3. Economic Causes:

(a) Terms and conditions of employment.

    More work hours.
    Working in night shifts.
    Disputes on promotions, layoff, retrenchment and dismissal etc.

(b) Working conditions.

    Working conditions such as too hot, too cold, dusty, noisy etc.



MRCET MBA
    Improper plant and work place layout.
    Frequent product design changes etc.

(c) Wages and other benefits.

    Inadequate wages.
    Poor fringe benefits.
    No bonus or other incentives etc.

(d) Denial of Legal and other Right of Workers:

    Proceeding against labour laws and regulations.
    Violation of already made agreements i.e., between employees and employers.

Settlement measures

The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 provides legalistic machinery for settlement of such disputes
by involving the interference of a third party.

The settlement machinery as provided by the Act consists of the three methods:

1. Conciliation

2. Arbitration

3. Adjudication

These are discussed one by one.

1. Conciliation:

In simple sense, conciliation means reconciliation of differences between persons. Conciliation
refers to the process by which representatives of workers and employers are brought together
before a third party with a view to persuading them to arrive at an agreement by mutual
discussion between them. The alternative name which is used for conciliation is mediation. The
third party may be one individual or a group of people.

In view of its objective to settle disputes as quickly as possible, conciliation is characterised by
the following features:

    The conciliator or mediator tries to remove the difference between the parties.
    He/she persuades the parties to think over the matter with a problem-solving approach,
     i.e., with a give and take approach.


MRCET MBA
    He/she only persuades the disputants to reach a solution and never imposes his/her own
     viewpoint.
    The conciliator may change his approach from case to case as he/she finds fit depending
     on other factors.

According to the Industrial Disputes Act 1947, the conciliation machinery in India consists of the
following:

1. Conciliation Officer

2. Board of Conciliation

3. Court of Enquiry

A brief description of each of these follows:

Conciliation Officer:

The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, under its Section 4, provides for the appropriate government
to appoint such number of persons as it thinks fit to be conciliation officers. Here, the appropriate
government means one in whose jurisdiction the disputes fall.

While the Commissioner /additional commissioner/deputy commissioner is appointed as
conciliation officer for undertakings employing 20 or more persons, at the State level, officers
from central Labour Commission office are appointed as conciliation officers, in the case of
Central government. The conciliation officer enjoys the powers of a civil court. He is expected to
give judgment within 14 days of the commencement of the conciliation proceedings. The
judgment given by him is binding on the parties to the dispute.

Board of Conciliation:

In case the conciliation officer fails to resolve the dispute between the disputants, under Section
5 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the appropriate government can appoint a Board of
Conciliation. Thus, the Board of Conciliation is not a permanent institution like conciliation
officer. It is an adhoc body consisting of a chairman and two or four other members nominated in
equal numbers by the parties to the dispute.

The Board enjoys the powers of civil court. The Board admits disputes only referred to it by the
government. It follows the same conciliation proceedings as is followed by the conciliation
officer. The Board is expected to give its judgment within two months of the date on which the
dispute was referred to it.




MRCET MBA
In India, appointment of the Board of Conciliation is rare for the settlement of disputes. In
practice, settling disputes through a conciliation officer is more common and flexible.

2. Arbitration:

Arbitration is a process in which the conflicting parties agree to refer their dispute to a neutral
third party known as „Arbitrator‟. Arbitration differs from conciliation in the sense that in
arbitration the arbitrator gives his judgment on a dispute while in conciliation, the conciliator
disputing parties to reach at a decision.

The arbitrator does not enjoy any judicial powers. The arbitrator listens to the view points of the
conflicting parties and then gives his decision which is binding on all the parties. The judgment
on the dispute is sent to the government. The government publishes the judgment within 30 days
of its submission and the same becomes enforceable after 30 days of its publication. In India,
there are two types of arbitration: Voluntary and Compulsory.

Voluntary Arbitration:

In voluntary arbitration both the conflicting parties appoint a neutral third party as arbitrator. The
arbitrator acts only when the dispute is referred to him/her. With a view to promote voluntary
arbitration, the Government of India has constituted a tripartite National Arbitration Promotion
Board in July 1987, consisting of representatives of employees (trade employers and the
Government. However, the voluntary arbitration could not be successful because the judgments
given by it are not binding on the disputants. Yes, moral binding is exception to it.

Compulsory Arbitration:

In compulsory arbitration, the government can force the disputing parties to go for compulsory
arbitration. In other form, both the disputing parties can request the government to refer their
dispute for arbitration. The judgment given by the arbitrator is binding on the parties of dispute.

3. Adjudication:

The ultimate legal remedy for the settlement of an unresolved dispute is its reference to adjudica-
tion by the government. The government can refer the dispute to adjudication with or without the
consent of the disputing parties. When the dispute is referred to adjudication with the consent of
the disputing parties, it is called „voluntary adjudication.‟ When the government herself refers
the dispute to adjudication without consulting the concerned parties, it is known as „compulsory
adjudication.

The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 provides three-tier machinery for the adjudication of industrial
disputes:


MRCET MBA
1. Labour Court

2. Industrial Tribunal

3. National Tribunal

A brief description on these follows:

1. Labour Court:

Under Section 7 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the appropriate Government by notifying
in the official Gazette, may constitute Labour Court for adjudication of the industrial disputes
The labour court consists of one independent person who is the presiding officer or has been a
judge of a High Court, or has been a district judge or additional district judge for not less than 3
years, or has been a presiding officer of a labour court for not less than 5 years. The labour court
deals with the matters specified in the second schedule of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.

These relate to:

1. The property or legality of an employer to pass an order under the standing orders.

2. The application and interpretation of standing orders.

3. Discharge or dismissal of workers including reinstatement or grant of relief to workmen
wrongfully dismissed.

4. Withdrawal of any statutory concession or privilege.

5. Illegality or otherwise of a strike or lockout.

6. All matters other than those reserved for industrial tribunals.

2. Industrial Tribunal:

Under Section 7A of the Act, the appropriate Government may constitute one or more Industrial
tribunals for the adjudication of industrial disputes. Compared to labour court, industrial
tribunals have a wider jurisdiction. An industrial tribunal is also constituted for a limited period
for a particular dispute on an adhoc basis.

The matters that come within the jurisdiction of an industrial tribunal include the following:



MRCET MBA
1. Wages, including the period and mode of payment.

2. Compensatory and other allowances.

3. Hours of work and rest periods.

4. Leave with wages and holidays.

5. Bonus, profit sharing, provident fund, and gratuity.

6. Classification by grades.

7. Rules of discipline.

8. Rationalization.

9. Retrenchment of employees and closure of an establishment or undertaking.

10. Any other matter that can be prescribed.

3. National Tribunal:

This is the third one man adjudicatory body appointed by the Central Government by notification
in the Official Gazette for the adjudication of industrial disputes of national importance. The
central Government may, if it thinks fit, appoint two persons as assessors to advise the National
Tribunal. When a national tribunal has been referred to, no labour court or industrial tribunal
shall have any jurisdiction to adjudicate upon such matter.

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
   ■ According to Dale Yoder, “Collective bargaining is the term used to describe a situation
     in which the essential conditions of employment are determined by bargaining process
     undertaken by representatives of a group of workers on the one hand and of one or more
     employers on the other.”

   ■ In the words of Flippo, “Collective bargaining is a process in which the representatives of
     a labour organisation and the representatives of business organisation meet and attempt to
     negotiate a contract or agreement, which specifies the nature of employee-employer-
     union relationship.”

Features of Collective Bargaining




MRCET MBA
   ■ It is a collective process. The representatives of both workers and management
     participate in bargaining.

   ■ It is a continuous process. It establishes regular and stable relationship between the
     parties involved. It involves not only the negotiation of the contract, but also the
     administration of the contract.

   ■ It is a flexible and dynamic process. The parties have to adopt a flexible attitude through
     the process of bargaining.

   ■ It is a method of partnership of workers in management

Subject Matter of collective bargaining
The Indian Institute of Personnel Management suggested the following subject matter of
collective bargaining:

    Purpose of agreement, its scope, and the definition of important terms

    Rights and responsibilities of the management and of the trade union

    Wages, bonus, production norms, leave, retirement benefits, and terms and conditions of
     service.

    Grievance redressal procedure

    Methods and machinery for the settlement of possible future disputes




MRCET MBA
Problems of Collective Bargaining
        Due to the dominance of outsiders in trade unionism in the country, there is
         multiplicity of unions which are weak and unstable, and do not represent majority of
         the employees. Moreover, there are inter-union rivalries, which further hinder the
         process of collective bargaining between the labour and the management.

        Since most of the trade unions are having political affiliations, they continue to be
         dominated by politicians, who use the unions and their members to meet their
         political ends.

        There is a lack of definite procedure to determine which union is to be recognized to
         serve as a bargaining agent on behalf of the workers

        In India, the law provides an easy access to adjudication. Under the Industrial
         Disputes Act, the parties to the dispute may request the Government to refer the
         matter to adjudication and the Government will constitute the adjudication
         machinery, i.e., labour court or industrial tribunal. Thus, the faith in the collective
         bargaining process is discouraged.

        There has been very close association between the trade unions and political parties.
         As a result, trade union movement has leaned towards political orientations rather
         than collective bargaining.

Failure of the employees and the employers to sort out their differences bilaterally leads to the
emergence of industrial disputes.

GRIEVANCE HANDLING: DEFINITION, FEATURES CAUSES, AND
EFFECTS

A grievance is any dissatisfaction or feeling of injustice having connection with one‟s
employment situation which is brought to the attention of management. Speaking broadly, a
grievance is any dissatisfaction that adversely affects organizational relations and productivity.
To understand what a grievance is, it is necessary to distinguish between dissatisfaction,
complaint, and grievance.

1. Dissatisfaction is anything that disturbs an employee, whether or not the unrest is expressed in
words.

2. Complaint is a spoken or written dissatisfaction brought to the attention of the supervisor or
the shop steward.

3. Grievance is a complaint that has been formally presented to a management representative or
to a union official.

According to Michael Jucious, „grievance is any discontent or dissatisfaction whether expressed
or not, whether valid or not, arising out of anything connected with the company which an
employee thinks, believes or even feels to be unfair, unjust or inequitable‟.

In short, grievance is a state of dissatisfaction, expressed or unexpressed, written or unwritten,
justified or unjustified, having connection with employment situation.

Features of Grievance:

1. A grievance refers to any form of discontent or dissatisfaction with any aspect of the
organization.

2. The dissatisfaction must arise out of employment and not due to personal or family problems.

3. The discontent can arise out of real or imaginary reasons. When employees feel that injustice
has been done to them, they have a grievance. The reason for such a feeling may be valid or
invalid, legitimate or irrational, justifiable or ridiculous.

4. The discontent may be voiced or unvoiced, but it must find expression in some form.
However, discontent per se is not a grievance. Initially, the employee may complain orally or in
writing. If this is not looked into promptly, the employee feels a sense of lack of justice. Now,
the discontent grows and takes the shape of a grievance.




MRCET MBA
5. Broadly speaking, thus, a grievance is traceable to be perceived as non-fulfillment of one‟s
expectations from the organization.

Causes of Grievances:

Grievances may occur due to a number of reasons:

1. Economic:

Employees may demand for individual wage adjustments. They may feel that they are paid less
when compared to others. For example, late bonus, payments, adjustments to overtime pay,
perceived inequalities in treatment, claims for equal pay, and appeals against performance-
related pay awards.

2. Work environment:

It may be undesirable or unsatisfactory conditions of work. For example, light, space, heat, or
poor physical conditions of workplace, defective tools and equipment, poor quality of material,
unfair rules, and lack of recognition.

3. Supervision:

It may be objections to the general methods of supervision related to the attitudes of the
supervisor towards the employee such as perceived notions of bias, favoritism, nepotism, caste
affiliations and regional feelings.

4. Organizational change:

Any change in the organizational policies can result in grievances. For example, the
implementation of revised company policies or new working practices.

5. Employee relations:

Employees are unable to adjust with their colleagues, suffer from feelings of neglect and
victimization and become an object of ridicule and humiliation, or other inter-employee disputes.

6. Miscellaneous:

These may be issues relating to certain violations in respect of promotions, safety methods,
transfer, disciplinary rules, fines, granting leaves, medical facilities, etc.




MRCET MBA
Effects of Grievance:

Grievances, if not identified and redressed, may adversely affect workers, managers, and the
organization.

The effects are the following:

1. on the production:

a. Low quality of production

b. Low productivity

c. Increase in the wastage of material, spoilage/leakage of machinery

d. Increase in the cost of production per unit

Need for a Formal Procedure to Handle Grievances:

A grievance handling system serves as an outlet for employee frustrations, discontents, and
gripes like a pressure release value on a steam boiler. Employees do not have to keep their
frustrations bottled up until eventually discontent causes explosion.

The existence of an effective grievance procedure reduces the need of arbitrary action by
supervisors because supervisors know that the employees are able to protect such behavior and
make protests to be heard by higher management. The very fact that employees have a right to be
heard and are actually heard helps to improve morale. In view of all these, every organization
should have a clear-cut procedure for grievance handling.

Steps in Grievance Handling Procedure:

At any stage of the grievance machinery, the dispute must be handled by some members of the
management. In grievance redressed, responsibility lies largely with the management. And,
grievances should be settled promptly at the first stage itself. The following steps will provide a
measure of guidance to the manager dealing with grievances.

i. Acknowledge Dissatisfaction:

Managerial/supervisory attitude to grievances is important. They should focus attention on
grievances, not turn away from them. Ignorance is not bliss; it is the bane of industrial conflict.
Condescending attitude on the part of supervisors and managers would aggravate the problem.

ii. Define the Problem:

Instead of trying to deal with a vague feeling of discontent, the problem should be defined
properly. Sometime the wrong complaint is given. By effective listening, one can make sure that
a true complaint is voiced.

iii. Get the Facts:

Facts should be separated from fiction. Though grievances result in hurt feelings, the effort
should be to get the facts behind the feelings. There is need for a proper record of each
grievance.

iv. Analyse and Decide:

Decisions on each of the grievances will have a precedent effect. While no time should be lost in
dealing with them, it is no excuse to be slip-shod about it. Grievance settlements provide
opportunities for managements to correct themselves, and thereby come closer to the employees.

leadership closer to the management, but it will surely alienate the workforce away from the
management.

v. Follow up:

Decisions taken must be followed up earnestly. They should be promptly communicated to the
employee concerned. If a decision is favorable to the employee, his immediate boss should have
the privilege of communicating the same.

LABOUR LEGISLATION:
The term „Labor Legislation‟ is used to cover all the laws which have been enacted to deal with
employment and non-employment, wages, working conditions, industrial relations, social
security and welfare of persons employed in industries. Thus „Labor Legislation‟ refers to all
laws of the government to provide social and economic security to the workers. These acts are
aimed at reduction of production losses due to industrial disputes and to ensure timely payment
wages and other minimum amenities to workers.
