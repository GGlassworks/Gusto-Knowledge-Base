                         Step 01
                         Evaluate your Needs
                         If you are like most glazing contractors in       This resource has been developed to
                         our industry you have found it to be next to      streamline the process of integrating basic
                         impossible to find the time and resources         training into your company workflow. We are
                         to develop an internal training program for       going to help you to define a process that
                         your existing project managers, new project       works for you, and then to develop success
                         managers, and even your support staff.            paths for each role within your organization.



                         Here are 5 Common Training Scenarios
                         New Project Manager - Bring Them up to Speed Quickly
                         This employee will systematically go through all of the training, starting with the 101
                         courses, then the PM responsibilities, systems, glass products, etc. This is the easiest of the
                         paths to set up internally.


                         Outside PM - Bring them into the World of Glass
                         An employee with a PM background but no glazing experience is going to benefit most
                         from starting with glazing products that they are unfamiliar with such as the systems and
                         glass components they will be in charge of taking off and ordering. Experienced project
                         managers can benefit from our more advanced courses as well.


                         Smart Sales People = Happy Customers = More Sales
                         LearnGlazing.com is an excellent resource to increase the overall knowledge of your
                         sales staff. The general knowledge offered in our systems and glass courses helps the
                         salesperson to be more knowledgeable about the products they will see on the projects
                         they are estimating. The same is true for the door hardware courses, as well as the shop
                         drawing courses, especially when your process involves your sales people interacting with
                         project kickoffs.


                         Glass Installers - Gain New Perspective
                         Whether installers are looking to widen their perspective of how a glass project is managed
                         or they are actively looking to transfer into a project management role, these courses will
                         provide a solid foundation. PM Responsibilities are the best place to start here to begin the
                         process.


                         Smart Staff = Happy Company
                         Your employees that answer the phones, handle the administrative tasks, or other similar
                         roles can absolutely benefit from knowing more about their industry. The 101 courses, and
                         product lanes are obvious choices, but having them exposed to the project management
                         process is beneficial for them to work more efficiently with the PM’s in the office. It also
                         may give them a path for improvement and advancement within the company.

                         Step 03
                         Review and Evaluate
                         Identify a Training Lead - Let the team at LearnGlazing.com know who will be
                         responsible for tracking student progress. The Training Lead or Group Analyst
                         will have the ability to see their team’s progress in the admin dashboard. It will be
                         important to assign a “training leader” to discuss the training with the students
                         each week, monitor their progress and help bridge the gap between the training
                         and the specifics of what makes your company successful.




                         Schedule Timely Discussions - Help students draw parallels between the
                         LearnGlazing.com training material and your business. Whether the discussions are
                         weekly or at the end of each training “lane”, these discussions will help you and your
                         team get the most from your investment. We recommend using the discussion
                         points in the syllabus to start these discussions.


                         Example of Discussion Points:
                          •   What are some of the critical details or components your company might look
                              for in your shop drawings?
                          •   Who might use shop drawings that you communicate with on a regular basis?
                          •   What items does your PM require for his / her drafter to get started on drawings?


                         Test for Success - While LearnGlazing.com offers training and quizzes along
                         the way, we also offer separate, detailed evaluations for both “Field” and “office”
                         operations. Both evaluations consist of 70+ questions meant to evaluate your
                         existing and prospective staff. Use these evaluations in the hiring process or to help
                         pinpoint future training needs.
