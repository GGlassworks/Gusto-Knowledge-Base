                                                              Concepts Every Engineer Should Know
                                                              In Part Two, consisting of Chapters 6 through 13, we focus on engineering fundamentals
                                                              and introduce students to the basic principles and physical laws that they will see over and
                                                              over in some form or other during the next four years. Successful engineers have a good
                                                              grasp of Fundamentals, which they can use to understand and solve many different prob-
                                                              lems. These are concepts that every engineer, regardless of his or her area of specialization,
                                                              should know.
                                                                    In these chapters, we emphasize that, from our observation of our surroundings, we have
                                                              learned that we need only a few physical quantities to fully describe events and our surround-
                                                              ings. These are length, time, mass, force, temperature, mole, and electric current. We also
                                                              explain that we need not only physical dimensions to describe our surroundings, but also some
                                                              way to scale or divide these physical dimensions. For example, time is considered a physical
                                                              dimension, but it can be divided into both small and large portions, such as seconds, minutes,
                                                              hours, days, years, decades, centuries, and millennia.
                                                                    We discuss common systems of units and emphasize that engineers must know how to
                                                              convert from one system of units to another and always show the appropriate units that go with
                                                              their calculations.
                                                                    We also explain that the physical laws and formulas that engineers use are based on obser-
                                                              vations of our surroundings. We show that we use mathematics and basic physical quantities to
                                                              express our observations.
                                                                    In these chapters, we also explain that there are many engineering design variables that are
                                                              related to the fundamental dimensions (quantities). To become a successful engineer a student
                                                              must first fully understand these fundamental and related variables and the pertaining govern-
                                                              ing laws and formulas. Then it is important for the student to know how these variables are mea-
                                                              sured, approximated, calculated, or used in practice.
                                                                    Chapter 6 explains the role and importance of fundamental dimension and units in anal-
                                                              ysis of engineering problems. Basic steps in the analysis of any engineering problem are discussed
                                                              in detail.
                                                                    Chapter 7 introduces length and length-related variables and explains their importance in
                                                              engineering work. For example, the role of area in heat transfer, aerodynamics, load distribu-
                                                              tion, and stress analysis is discussed. Measurement of length, area, and volume, along with
                                                              numerical estimation (such as trapezoidal rule) of these values, are presented.
                                                                    Chapter 8 considers time and time-related engineering parameters. Periods, frequencies,
                                                              linear and angular velocities and accelerations, volumetric flow rates and flow of traffic are also
                                                              discussed in Chapter 8.
                                                                    Mass and mass-related parameters such density, specific weight, mass flow rate, and mass
                                                              moment of inertia, and their role in engineering analysis, are presented in Chapter 9.
                                                                    Chapter 10 covers the importance of force and force-related parameters in engineering.
                                                              The important concepts in mechanics are explained conceptually. What is meant by force,
                                                              internal force, reaction, pressure, modulus of elasticity, impulsive force (force acting over time),
                                                              work (force acting over a distance) and moment (force acting at a distance) are discussed in
                                                              detail.

                                                                        it is important for students to understand some of the simple-energy-estimation procedures.
                                                                        Because of this fact, we have added a new section on Degree-Days and Energy Estimation.
                                                                              Chapter 12 considers topics such as direct and alternating current, electricity, basic cir-

                                                              An Important Design Decision
                                                              As engineers, whether you are designing a machine part, a toy, a frame of a car, or a

                                                              Why Are They Important?
                                                              In Part Six, consisting of Chapters 18 through 20, we introduce students to important math-
                                                              ematical, statistical, and economical concepts. We explain that engineering problems are
                                                              mathematical models of physical situations. Some engineering problems lead to linear mod-
                                                              els, whereas others result in nonlinear models. Some engineering problems are formulated in
                                                              the form of differential equations and some in the form of integrals. Therefore, a good under-

                                                              neering problems. Moreover, statistical models are becoming common tools in the hands of
                                                              practicing engineers to solve quality control and reliability issues, and to perform failure
                                                              analyses.
                                                                    Civil engineers use statistical models to study the reliability of construction materials and
                                                              structures, and to design for flood control, for example. Electrical engineers use statistical mod-
                                                              els for signal processing and for developing voice-recognition software. Manufacturing engineers
                                                              use statistics for quality control assurance of the products they produce. Mechanical engineers
                                                              use statistics to study the failure of materials and machine parts.
                                                                    Economic factors also play important roles in engineering design decision making. If you

                        In Part One of this book, we will introduce you to the engineering profession. Engineers are problem
                        solvers. They have a good grasp of fundamental physical and chemical laws and mathematics and
                        apply these laws and principles to design, develop, test, and supervise the manufacture of millions
                        of products and services. Engineers, regardless of their background, follow certain steps when
                        designing the products and services we use in our everyday lives. Successful engineers possess
                        good communication skills and are team players. Ethics plays a very important role in engineering.
                        As eloquently stated by the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) code of ethics, “Engi-
                        neering is an important and learned profession. As members of this profession, engineers are
                        expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Engineering has a direct and vital
                        impact on the quality of life for all people. Accordingly, the services provided by engineers require
                        honesty, impartiality, fairness and equity, and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health,
                        safety, and welfare. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior which requires
                        adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct. In the next five chapters, we will introduce
                        you to the engineering profession, how to prepare for an exciting engineering career, the design pro-
                        cess, engineering communication, and ethics.

                                                              example, manufacturing and industrial engineers. When you are getting ready to take your

                                                              bring water from the well to your home was designed by mechanical and civil engineers. The
                                                              water could be heated by natural gas that is brought to your home thanks to the work and effort
                                                              of chemical, mechanical, civil, and petroleum engineers. After your morning shower, when you
                                                              get ready to dry yourself with a towel, think about what types of engineer worked behind the
                                                              scenes to produce the towels. Yes, the cotton towel was made with the help of agricultural,
                                                              industrial, manufacturing, chemical, petroleum, civil, and mechanical engineers. Think about
                                                              the machines that were used to pick the cotton, transport the cotton to a factory, clean it, and
                                                              dye it to a pretty color that is pleasing to your eyes. Then other machines were used to weave
                                                              the fabric and send it to sewing machines that were designed by mechanical engineers. The
                                                              same is true of the clothing you are about to wear. Your clothing may contain some polyester,
                                                              which was made possible with the aid of petroleum and chemical engineers. “Well,” you may
                                                              say, “I can at least sit down and eat my breakfast and not wonder whether some engineers made
                                                              this possible as well.” But the food you are about to eat was made with the help and collabora-
                                                              tion of various engineering disciplines, from agricultural to mechanical. Let’s say you are about
                                                              to have some cereal. The milk was kept fresh in your refrigerator thanks to the efforts and work
                                                              of mechanical engineers who designed the refrigerator components and chemical engineers who
                                                              investigated alternative refrigerant ﬂuids with appropriate thermal properties and other envi-
                                                              ronmentally friendly properties that can be used in your refrigerator. Furthermore, electrical

                                                                    Now you are ready to get into your car or take the bus to go to school. The car you are about

                                                              much that you do in your daily life that has not involved the work of engineers. Be proud of the
                                                              decision you have made to become an engineer. Soon you will become one of those whose
                                                              behind-the-scenes efforts will be taken for granted by billions of people around the world. But
                                                              you will accept that fact gladly, knowing that what you do will make people’s lives better.

                                                              and Sustainability Concerns
                                                              We as people, regardless of where we live, need the following things: food, clothing, shelter, and
                                                              water for drinking or cleaning purposes. In addition, we need various modes of transportation
                                                              to get to different places, because we may live and work in different cities or wish to visit friends
                                                              and relatives who may live elsewhere. We also like to have some sense of security, to be able to
                                                              relax and be entertained. We need to be liked and appreciated by our friends and family, as well.
                                                                   Increasingly, because of worldwide socioeconomic population trends, environmental

                                                              In this section, we will ﬁrst discuss engineering in a broad sense, and then we will focus on
                                                              selected aspects of engineering. We will also look at the traits and characteristics common to
                                                              many engineers. Next we will discuss some speciﬁc engineering disciplines. As we said earlier in
                                                              this chapter, perhaps some of you have not yet decided what you want to study during your
                                                              college years and consequently may have many questions, including: What is engineering and
                                                              what do engineers do? What are some of the areas of specialization in engineering? Do I really
                                                              want to study engineering? How will I know that I have picked the best ﬁeld for me? Will the
                                                              demand for my area of specialization be high when I graduate, and beyond that?
                                                                    The following sections are intended to help you make a decision that you will be happy
                                                              with; and don’t worry about ﬁnding answers to all these questions right now. You have some
                                                              time to ponder them because most of the coursework during the ﬁrst year of engineering is sim-
                                                              ilar for all engineering students, regardless of their speciﬁc discipline. So you have at least a year
                                                              to consider various possibilities. This is true at most educational institutions. Even so, you should
                                                              talk to your advisor early to determine how soon you must choose an area of specialization. And
                                                              don’t be concerned about your chosen profession changing in a way that makes your education
                                                              obsolete. Most companies assist their engineers in acquiring further training and education to
                                                              keep up with changing technologies. A good engineering education will enable you to become
                                                              a good problem solver throughout your life, regardless of the particular problem or situation. You
                                                              may wonder during the next few years of school why you need to be learning some of the mate-

                                                              assured that you are learning both content information and strategies of thinking and analysis
                                                              that will equip you to face future challenges, ones that do not even exist yet.

                                         1.3                  Common Traits of Good Engineers

                                                              Although the activities of engineers are quite varied, there are some personality traits and work
                                                              habits that typify most of today’s successful engineers.
                                                              • Engineers are problem solvers.
                                                              • Good engineers have a ﬁrm grasp of the fundamental principles of engineering, which they
                                                                can use to solve many different problems.
                                                              • Good engineers are analytical, detailed oriented, and creative.
                                                              • Good engineers have a desire to be lifelong learners. For example, they take continuing edu-
                                                                cation classes, seminars, and workshops to stay abreast of innovations and new technologies.
                                                                This is particularly important in today’s world because the rapid changes in technology will
                                                                require you as an engineer to keep pace with new technologies. Moreover, you will risk being
                                                                laid off or denied promotion if you are not continually improving your engineering education.
                                                              • Good engineers, regardless of their area of specialization, have a core knowledge that can be
                                                                applied to many areas. Therefore, well-trained engineers are able to work outside their area
                                                                of specialization in other related ﬁelds. For example, a good mechanical engineer with a well-
                                                                rounded knowledge base can work as an automotive engineer, an aerospace engineer, or as a
                                                                chemical engineer.
                                                              • Good engineers have written and oral communication skills that equip them to work well
                                                                with their colleagues and to convey their expertise to a wide range of clients.
                                                              • Good engineers have time-management skills that enable them to work productively and
                                                                efﬁciently.
                                                              • Good engineers have good “people skills” that allow them to interact and communicate
                                                                effectively with various people in their organization. For example, they are able to commu-
                                                                nicate equally well with the sales and marketing experts and their own colleagues.
                                                              • Engineers are required to write reports. These reports might be lengthy, detailed technical
                                                                reports containing graphs, charts, and engineering drawings, or they may take the form of
                                                                brief memoranda or executive summaries.
                                                              • Engineers are adept at using computers in many different ways to model and analyze various
                                                                practical problems.
                                                              • Good engineers actively participate in local and national discipline-speciﬁc organizations by
                                                                attending seminars, workshops, and meetings. Many even make presentations at professional
                                                                meetings.
                                                              • Engineers generally work in a team environment where they consult each other to solve com-
                                                                plex problems. They divide up the task into smaller, manageable problems among them-
                                                                selves; consequently, productive engineers must be good team players. Good interpersonal
                                                                and communication skills are increasingly important now because of the global market. For
                                                                example, various parts of a car could be made by different companies located in different
                                                                countries. In order to ensure that all components ﬁt and work well together, cooperation and
                                                                coordination are essential, which demands strong communication skills.
                                                              Clearly, an interest in building things or taking things apart or solving puzzles is not all that is
                                                              required to become an engineer. In addition to having a dedication to learning and a desire to
                                                              ﬁnd solutions, an engineer needs to foster certain attitudes and personality traits.

                                                                        • For almost all entry-level engineering jobs, a bachelor’s degree in engineering is required.
                                                                        According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics:

                                                              if you do decide to study petroleum engineering, employment opportunities for petroleum
                                                              engineers should be favorable because the number of degrees granted in petroleum engineering
                                                              has traditionally been low. Also, petroleum engineers work around the globe, and many employ-

                                                              Nuclear Engineering Only a few engineering colleges around the country offer a nuclear engi-

                                                              the design and development of industrial and diagnostic medical equipment. Nuclear engi-

                                                                   Most mining engineers work in the mining industry, some work for government agencies,
                                                              and some work for manufacturing industries. The job outlook for mining engineers is not as

                                                              and new mines. Similar to petroleum engineers, U.S. mining engineers may ﬁnd good oppor-

                                                              These new materials could be in the form of metal alloys, ceramics, plastics, or composites.
                                                              Materials engineers study the nature, atomic structure, and thermo-physical properties of

                                                                        an average daily basis to accomplish certain things. Many of us need approximately 8 hours of
                                                                        sleep every night. In addition, we all need to have some time for work, friends and family,
                                                                        studying, relaxation and recreation, and just gooﬁng around.
                                                                             Suppose you were given a million dollars when you reached your adulthood and were told
                                                                        that is all the money that you would have for the rest of your life for clothing, food, entertain-
                                                                        ment, leisure activities, and so on. How would you go about spending the money? Of course,
                                                                        you would make reasonable efforts to spend and invest it wisely. You would carefully budget for
                                                                        various needs, trying to get the most for your money. You would look for good sales and plan
                                                                        to buy only what was necessary, and you would attempt not to waste any money. Think of your
                                                                        education in a similar manner. Don’t just pay your tuition and plan to sit in class and daydream.
                                                                        Your education is an expensive investment, one that requires your responsible management.

             28            Chapter 2 Preparing for an Engineering Career

                                                              A student at a private university went to her instructor to drop a class because she was not get-
                                                              ting the grade she wanted. The instructor asked her how much she had paid for the class. She
                                                              said that she had spent approximately $2000 for the four-credit class. The instructor happened
                                                              to have a laptop computer on his desk and asked her the following question: If you bought a
                                                              laptop computer from a computer store, took it home to install some software on it, and had
                                                              some difﬁculty making the computer work, would you throw it in the trash? The student looked
                                                              at her instructor as if he had asked a stupid question. He explained to her that her dropping a
                                                              class she had already paid tuition for is similar in many ways to throwing away a computer the
                                                              ﬁrst time she has trouble with some software. Try to learn from this example. Generally speak-
                                                              ing, for most of us learning is a lot of work at the beginning, and it’s not much fun. But often,
                                                              after even a short period of time, learning will become a joy, something you work at that raises
                                                              your own self-esteem. Learning and understanding new things can be downright exciting. Let
                                                              us examine what you can do to enhance your learning during the next few years to make the
                                                              engineering education you are about to receive a fulﬁlling and rewarding experience.
                                                                   Let us begin by performing some simple arithmetic to see how efﬁcient we might be in using
                                                              our time. With 24 hours in a given day, we have, for a one-week period, 168 hours available. Let’s
                                                              allocate liberal time periods to some activities common to most students. When following this
                                                              example, refer to Table 2.1. Notice that the time periods allocated to various activities in this table
                                                              are very generous and you don’t have to deprive yourself of sleep or relaxation or socializing with
                                                              your friends. These numbers are meant only to give you a reasonable starting point to help you
                                                              budget your time on a weekly basis. You may prefer to spend an hour a day relaxing during the
                                                              week and use the additional social hours on weekends. Even with generous relaxation and social
                                                              time, this sample allows 68 hours a week to devote to your education. A typical engineering
                                                              student takes 16 semester credits, which simply means about 16 hours a week are spent in the class-
                                                              room. You still have 52 hours a week to study. A good rule of thumb is to spend at least 2 to 3 hours
                                                              of studying for each hour of class time, which amounts to at least 32 hours and at most 48 hours
                                                              a week of studying. Of course, some classes are more demanding than others and will require
                                                              more time for preparation and homework, projects, and lab work. You still have from 4 to 20 hours
                                                              a week in your budget to allocate at your own discretion.
                                                                   You may not be an 18-year-old freshman whose parents are paying most of your tuition.
                                                              You may be an older student who is changing careers. Or you may be married and have chil-

             30            Chapter 2 Preparing for an Engineering Career

                                                              in some areas. For example, you may want to consider not taking as many credits in a given
                                                              semester and follow a ﬁve-year plan instead of a four-year plan. Depending on how many hours
                                                              a week you need to work, you can rebudget your time. The purpose of this time budget example
                                                              is mainly to emphasize the fact that you need to learn to manage your time wisely if you want
                                                              to be successful in life. Every individual, just like any good organization, monitors his or her
                                                              resources. No one wants you to turn into a robot and time yourself to the second. These
                                                              examples are provided to give you an idea of how much time is available to you and to urge you
                                                              to consider how efﬁciently and wisely you are allocating and using your time. The point is that
                                                              budgeting your time is very important.
                                                                   With the exception of a few courses, most classes that you will take are scheduled for
                                                              50-minute periods, with a 10-minute break between classes to allow students to attend several
                                                              classes in a row. The other important reason for having a 10-minute break is to allow time to
                                                              clear your head. Most of us have a limited attention span and cannot concentrate on a certain
                                                              topic for a long period of time without a break. Taking a break is healthy; it keeps your mind
                                                              and body working well.
                                                                   Typically, as a ﬁrst-term freshman in engineering you may have a course load similar to the
                                                              one shown here:

                                                              Table 2.2 is an example of a schedule for a freshman engineering student. You already know your
                                                              strengths and weaknesses; you may have to make several attempts to arrive at a good schedule that
                                                              will ﬁt your needs the best. You may also need to modify the example schedule shown to allow for
                                                              any variability in the number of credits or other engineering program requirements at your partic-
                                                              ular school. Maintain a daily logbook to keep track of how closely you are following the schedule
                                                              and where time is being used inefﬁciently, and modify your schedule accordingly.



                                         2.3                  Daily Studying and Preparation

                                                              You start studying and preparing from the very ﬁrst day of class! It is always a good idea to read the
                                                              material that your professor is planning to cover in class ahead of time. This practice will
                                                              improve both your understanding and retention of the lecture materials. It is also important to
                                                              go over the material that was discussed in class again later the same day after the lecture was
                                                              given. When you are reading the material ahead of a lecture, you are familiarizing yourself with
                                                              the information that the instructor will present to you in class. Don’t worry if you don’t fully
                                                              understand everything you are reading at that time. During the lecture you can focus on the
                                                              material that you did not fully understand and ask questions. When you go over the material
                                                              after the lecture, everything then should come together. Remember to read before the class and
                                                              study the material after the class on the same day!

                                                                        concepts that you do not fully understand, during the lecture you can ask questions to clarify

                                                              students may not realize that they should also take notes when reading the textbook. Try to lis-
                                                              ten carefully during the lectures so you can identify and record the important ideas and con-
                                                              cepts. If you have read ahead of time the text materials that your professor is planning to cover
                                                              in class, then you are prepared to write down notes that complement what is already in your
                                                              textbook. You don’t need to write down everything that your professor says, writes, or projects
                                                              onto a screen. The point is to listen very carefully and write down only notes regarding the
                                                              important concepts that you did not understand when you read the book.
                                                                   Use wirebound notebooks for your notes. Don’t use loose papers, because it is too easy to
                                                              lose some of your notes that way. Keeping a notebook is a good habit to develop now. As an

                                                              the notes in a wirebound notepad or a notebook with the pages sown into the binding so you
                                                              won’t lose any pages. Study your notes for at least an hour or two the same day you take them.
                                                              Make sure you understand all the concepts and ideas that were discussed in class before you

                                                              to discuss and explain key ideas and concepts to each other. Everyone in your study group should
                                                              agree that they need to come prepared to discuss appropriate materials and that they all need to
                                                              contribute to the discussions. It should be understood that the study groups serve a different pur-

                                                              tance, help if you can by explaining new concepts you have learned. If you have difﬁculty

                                                              the concept yourself and you need to study the material in more detail. So remember that a

                                                              in your own words to others in the group. Be an active learner not a passive learner!

                                                              Prepare for Examinations If you study and prepare from the ﬁrst day of class, then you should

                                                              time for learning new concepts and ideas. The night before the exam is the time for review only.
                                                              Just before an exam, spend a few hours reviewing your notes and sample problems. Make sure
                                                              that you get a good night’s rest so you can be fresh and think clearly when you take the exam. It
                                                              may be a good idea to ask your instructor ahead of time what type of exam it will be, how many
                                                              questions there will be, or what suggestions she or he has to help you prepare better for the exam.
                                                              As with any test, be sure you understand what the questions are asking. Read the questions care-
                                                              fully before you proceed with answering them. If there is some ambiguity in the exam questions,
                                                              ask the instructor for clariﬁcation. After you have looked over the exam, you may want to answer
                                                              the easy questions ﬁrst and then come back to the more complicated questions. Finally, some of
                                                              you may have experienced test anxiety when taking an exam. To reduce the anxiety, prepare well
                                                              and consider timing yourself when doing your homework problems.

                                         2.5                  Your Graduation Plan

                                                              At most schools, there are three levels of admissions. First, you get admitted to the university. For
                                                              that to happen, you must meet certain requirements. For example, you need to rank in the top x%
                                                              of your high school class, have a certain ACT or SAT score, and have so many years of english,
                                                              mathematics, sciences, and social studies. After you complete your freshman year, you may need
                                                              to apply to the college in which the engineering program of your interest resides. To be accepted
                                                              to, say, the college of engineering at your university, you need to meet additional requirements.
                                                              Finally, at the end of the second year, upon successful completion of math, chemistry, physics, and
                                                              basic engineering classes, then you need to apply and gain admission to a speciﬁc engineering pro-
                                                              gram, for example, civil, electrical, mechanical, and so on. Make sure you meet with your advisor
                                                              so that you understand what the requirements are for admission to the college and the speciﬁc pro-
                                                              gram, because at many universities, admission to an engineering program is highly selective.
                                                                    It is also a good idea to sit down with your advisor and plan your graduation. List all of the
                                                              classes that you need to take in order to obtain your degree in four or ﬁve years. You can always
                                                              modify this plan later as your interests change. Make sure you understand the prerequisites for
                                                              each class and in which semester a class typically is offered; a program flowchart will be quite use-
                                                              ful. In order to make you aware of your social responsibilities as an engineer, you also are required
                                                              to take a certain number of classes in social sciences and humanities. Think about your current
                                                              interests and plan your social science and humanity electives as well. Again, don’t worry about
                                                              your interests changing, you can always modify your plan. For those of you who currently are
                                                              studying at a community college and planning to transfer to a university later, you should con-
                                                              tact the university, learn about their engineering course transfer policies and requirements, and
                                                              prepare your graduation plan accordingly.



                                         2.6                  Other Considerations

                                                              Doing Volunteer Work If your study schedule allows, volunteer for a few hours a week to help
                                                              those in need in your community. The rewards are unbelievable! Not only will you feel good
                                                              about yourself but you will gain a sense of satisfaction and feel connected to your community.
                                                              Volunteering could also help develop communication, management, or supervisory skills that
                                                              you may not develop by just attending school.

                                                              Vote in Local and National Elections Most of you are 18 or older. Take your civic duties seri-
                                                              ously. Exercise your right to vote, and try to play an active role in your local, state, or federal
                                                              government. Remember that freedom is not free. Be a good, responsible citizen.

                                                              Get to Know Your Classmates There are many good reasons for getting to know one or two other

                                                              from class, you have someone to contact to ﬁnd out what the assignment is or ﬁnd out what was
                                                              covered in class. Record the following information on the course syllabi for all your classes: the

            E      their backgrounds, fol-
                   low certain steps when
             designing the products and
             services we use in our every-
             day lives. These steps are:
             (1) recognizing the need for a
             product or service, (2) defining
             and understanding the problem
             (the need) completely, (3) doing

             the preliminary research and
             preparation, (4) conceptualizing
             ideas for possible solutions,
             (5) synthesizing the results,
             (6) evaluating good ideas in
             more detail, (7) optimizing the
             result to arrive at the best pos-
             sible solution, and (8) present-
             ing the solution.

                                                                        toys, home appliances, surgical equipment, heating and cooling equipment, health care devices,

                                                                        such as cost, efﬁciency, reliability, sustainability, and safety when designing the products, and they

                                                                        Engineers also design and supervise the construction of buildings, dams, highways, and mass tran-

                                                                        that engineers, regardless of their background, follow to arrive at solutions to problems. The

                                                                        ing the problem (the need) completely, (3) doing preliminary research and preparation, (4) con-
                                                                        ceptualizing ideas for possible solutions, (5) synthesizing the ﬁndings, (6) evaluating good ideas
                                                                        in more detail, (7) optimizing solutions to arrive at the best possible solution, (8) and present-
                                                                        ing the ﬁnal solution.
                                                                              Keep in mind that these steps, which we will discuss soon, are not independent of one
                                                                        another and do not necessarily follow one another in the order in which they are presented here.
                                                                        In fact, engineers often need to return to steps 1 and 2 when clients decide to change design
                                                                        parameters. Quite often, engineers are also required to give oral and written progress reports on
                                                                        a regular time basis. Therefore, be aware of the fact that even though we listed presentation of
                                                                        the design process as step 8, it could well be an integral part of many other design steps. Let us

                                                              Step 1: Recognizing the Need for a Product or a Service
                                                              All you have to do is look around to realize the large number of products and services —
                                                              designed by engineers—that you use every day. Most often, we take these products and services
                                                              for granted until, for some reason, there is an interruption in the services they provide. Some of
                                                              these existing products are constantly being modiﬁed to take advantage of new technologies. For
                                                              example, cars and home appliances are constantly being redesigned to incorporate new tech-
                                                              nologies. In addition to the products and the services already in use, new products are being
                                                              developed every day for the purpose of making our lives more comfortable, more pleasurable,
                                                              and less laborious. There is also that old saying that “every time someone complains about a
                                                              situation, or about a task, or curses a product, right there, there is an opportunity for a product
                                                              or a service.” As you can tell, the need for products and services exists; what one has to do is to
                                                              identify them. The need may be identiﬁed by you, the company that you may eventually work

                                                              Step 2: Problem Deﬁnition and Understanding
                                                              One of the ﬁrst things you need to do as a design engineer is to fully understand the problem.
                                                              This is the most important step in any design process. If you do not have a good grasp of what the
                                                              problem is or of what the client wants, you will not come up with a solution that is relevant to
                                                              the need of the client. The best way to fully understand a problem is by asking many questions.
                                                              You may ask the client questions such as: How much money are you willing to spend on this
                                                              project? Are there restrictions on the size or the type of materials that can be used? When
                                                              do you need the product or the service? How many of these products do you need? Questions
                                                              often lead to more questions that will better deﬁne the problem. Moreover, keep in mind that

                                                                        engineers generally work in a team environment where they consult each other to solve com-

                                                                        consequently, productive engineers must be good team players. Good interpersonal and com-

                                                                        problems. For example, various parts of a product could be made by different companies located
                                                                        in different states or countries. In order to ensure that all components ﬁt and work well together,
                                                                        cooperation and coordination are essential, which demands good teamwork and strong com-

                                                                        well deﬁned before you move on to the next step. This point cannot be emphasized enough. Good
                                                                        problems solvers are those who ﬁrst fully understand what the problem is.


                                                                        Step 3: Research and Preparation
                                                                        Once you fully understand the problem, as a next step you need to collect useful information.
                                                                        Generally speaking, a good place to start is by searching to determine if a product already exists
                                                                        that closely meets the need of your client. Perhaps a product, or components of a product, already
                                                                        has been developed by your company that you could modify to meet the need. You do not want
                                                                        to “reinvent the wheel!” As mentioned earlier, depending on the scope, some projects require col-
                                                                        laboration with other companies, so you need to ﬁnd out what is available through these other
                                                                        companies as well. Try to collect as much information as you can. This is where you spend lots
                                                                        of time not only with the client but also with other engineers and technicians. Internet search
                                                                        engines are becoming increasingly important tools to gather such information. Once you have
                                                                        collected all pertinent information, you must then review it and organize it in a suitable manner.


                                                                        Step 4: Conceptualization
                                                                        During this phase of design, you need to generate some ideas or concepts that could offer rea-
                                                                        sonable solutions to your problem. In other words, without performing any detailed analysis,
                                                                        you need to come up with some possible ways of solving the problem. You need to be creative
                                                                        and perhaps develop several alternative solutions. At this stage of design, you do not need to rule
                                                                        out any reasonable working concept. If the problem consists of a complex system, you need to
                                                                        identify the components of the system. You do not need to look at details of each possible solu-
                                                                        tion yet, but you need to perform enough analysis to see whether the concepts that you are
                                                                        proposing have merit. Simply stated, you need to ask yourself the following question: Would
                                                                        the concepts be likely to work if they were pursued further? Throughout the design process, you
                                                                        must also learn to budget your time. Good engineers have time-management skills that enable
                                                                        them to work productively and efﬁciently. You must learn to create a milestone chart detailing
                                                                        your time plan for completing the project. You need to show the time periods and the corre-
                                                                        sponding tasks that are to be performed during these time periods.

                                                                        Recall from our discussion in Chapter 1 that good engineers have a ﬁrm grasp of the funda-

                                                              sure that your design will be in compliance with these codes and standards. We will discuss engi-
                                                              neering codes and standards in Section 3.11.


                                                              Step 6: Evaluation
                                                              Analyze the problem in more detail. You may have to identify critical design parameters and con-
                                                              sider their inﬂuence in your ﬁnal design. At this stage, you need to make sure that all calcula-
                                                              tions are performed correctly. If there are some uncertainties in your analysis, you must perform
                                                              experimental investigation. When possible, working models must be created and tested. At this
                                                              stage of the design procedure, the best solution must be identiﬁed from alternatives. Details of
                                                              how the product is to be fabricated must be worked out fully.


                                                              Step 7: Optimization
                                                              Optimization means minimization or maximization. There are two broad types of design: a
                                                              functional design and an optimized design. A functional design is one that meets all of the
                                                              preestablished design requirements but allows for improvement to be made in certain areas.
                                                              To better understand the concept of a functional design, we will consider an example. Let us
                                                              assume that we are to design a 3-meter-tall (10 ft) ladder to support a person who weighs
                                                              1335 newtons (300 pounds) with a certain factor of safety. We will come up with a design that
                                                              consists of a steel ladder that is 3 meter tall (10 ft) and can safely support the load of 1335 N
                                                              (300 lb) at each step. The ladder would cost a certain amount of money. This design would
                                                              satisfy all of the requirements, including those of strength and size, and thus constitutes a

                                                                        functional design. Before we can consider improving our design, we need to ask ourselves
                                                                        what criterion we should use to optimize the design. Design optimization is always based on
                                                                        some particular criterion, such as cost, strength, size, weight, reliability, noise, or performance.

                                                                        making the ladder from aluminum. We would also perform stress analysis on the new ladder

                                                                             Traditionally, improvements in a design come from the process of starting with an

                                                              Step 8: Presentation
                                                              Now that you have a ﬁnal solution, you need to communicate your solution to the client, who
                                                              may be your boss, another group within your company, or an outside customer. You may have
                                                              to prepare not only an oral presentation but also a written report. As we said in Chapter 1,
                                                              engineers are required to write reports. Depending on the size of the project, these reports
                                                              might be lengthy, detailed technical reports containing graphs, charts, and engineering draw-

                                                                    A reminder again that although we have listed the presentation as Step 8 of the design pro-
                                                              cess, quite often engineers are required to give oral and written progress reports on a regular time
                                                              basis to various groups. Consequently, presentation could well be an integral part of many other
                                                              design steps. Because of the importance of communication, we have devoted an entire chapter
                                                              to engineering communication (see Chapter 4).
                                                                    Finally, recall from our discussion in Chapter 1 regarding the attributes of good engineers,
                                                              we said that good engineers have written and oral communication skills that equip them to
                                                              work well with their colleagues and to convey their expertise to a wide range of clients. More-

                                                              tively with various people in their organization. For example, they are able to communicate
                                                              equally well with the sales and marketing experts and with their own colleagues in engineering.
                                                                    In Step 7 of the design process, we discussed optimization. Let us now use a simple example
                                                              to introduce you to some of the fundamental concepts of optimization and its terminology.

             50            Chapter 3 Introduction to Engineering Design

                                                                   In private sector, the need is usually determined by the owner of a business or real estate.
                                                              On the other hand, in public sector, the need is usually identified by others, such as a school
                                                              principal, a city engineer, or a district engineer. Moreover, the need must be approved by a
                                                              corresponding oversight body, such as a school board, city council, or the department of trans-
                                                              portation and state legislatures.


                                                              Step 2: Define the Usage of the Building
                                                              Before any design work is done, the person (client) who has identified the need for a building
                                                              determines the types of activities that would take place in the building. For example, in the case
                                                              of a new elementary school, the principal forecasts the number of students expected to enroll in
                                                              the near future. The enrollment projection data then allows the principal to determine the num-
                                                              ber of classrooms, and computer labs, and the need for a library or a cafeteria. For a medical
                                                              clinic, other activities are considered such as the number of examination rooms, x-ray labs, recep-
                                                              tion areas, record rooms, and so on. The usage and activity data will help the architect determine
                                                              the amount of area (square footage) needed to accommodate the client’s projected need.


                                                              Step 3: Project Planning
                                                              During this stage, the person who has requested the project (the client) selects potential sites
                                                              for the new building. In addition to the cost and whether the location is ideal for the proposed
                                                              building, other factors are considered. These factors include zoning, environmental impact,
                                                              archaeology impact, and traffic flow. Although detail study or design is not necessary at this
                                                              stage, it is important for the client to recognize all the factors that would affect the project cost
                                                              and feasibility. For example, if the potential site is zoned as residential, it would be extremely




             Engineers must take many
             factors into account when
             completing the project plan.

                                                                        public hearings and approval by the city council with recommendation from the zoning com-

                                                                        additional traffic drawn by the new building, wet land remediation, effect on wildlife, and so
                                                                        on. If a site contains archaeology artifacts, disturbance may not be permitted. Design may

                                                                        tion information from projects near the potential site would help civil engineers assess the
                                                                        extent of archaeology artifacts in the potential project site.
                                                                             Also in this stage, the client selects an architectural firm or a contractor to initiate the
                                                                        design phase. If the client selects a contractor, then the architectural firm is hired by the
                                                                        contractor. It is also important to note that the architectural firm does not perform any design;
                                                                        instead, they collaborate with structural engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers,
                                                                        interior designers, drafters, and project managers to complete the project.


                                                                        Step 4: Schematic Design Phase
                                                                        During this phase, the architect consults with the client to fully understand the intended usage
                                                                        for the building and to obtain an approximate budget for the project. The architect then pre-
                                                                        pares multiple schematic designs for the building. Through continuous communication with
                                                                        the client, the architect then narrows down the options to one or two designs. The design would
                                                                        show the layout of the space and rooms. The material type and the framing system also would
                                                                        be proposed at this stage. The architect then presents the schematic design(s) to the client and
                                                                        gets feedback from the client for the next design phase.


                                                                        Step 5: Design Development (DD) Phase
                                                                        In the design development (DD) phase, the architect continues to finalize the layout of the
                                                                        building. The architect consults with the structural engineer at this phase so that limits on
                                                                        column size and beam size can be determined. The limitation on beam sizes is influenced by
                                                                        the ceiling height and the overall height of the building. The limitation on column sizes would
                                                                        affect how the rooms are arranged. This is to avoid having many columns in the middle of a
                                                                        room or a space.
                                                                             Once the architect has finalized the layout of the rooms and spaces, the structural engineer
                                                                        then begins to perform a preliminary design for the building. Preliminary designs of the HVAC
                                                                        (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system will be done by the mechanical engineer,
                                                                        while the electric design is done by the electrical engineer. Next, the interior designer provides
                                                                        a preliminary design for the interior of the building. Based on the preliminary design, the con-
                                                                        tractor will then provide a cost estimate for the project.
                                                                             At the end of this phase, the architect who represents the engineers, the interior designer,
                                                                        and the contractor would then meet with the client to present the preliminary design and seek
                                                                        feedback. The client may request the rearrangement of rooms or change in the interior design
                                                                        based on cost or other factors. After receiving client’s input, the next phase of design is initiated.


                                                                        Step 6: Construction Documentation (CD) Phase
                                                                        During this phase of the project, all of the detail work is done. The construction document

                                                                   The structural engineer provides all the design details for structural components includ-

                                                              will commence. The general contractor will have a superintendent on site to manage the con-
                                                              struction and its progress and coordinates all the subcontractors. In large-scale projects such as
                                                              bridges, highways, or power plants, a construction manager, who is a registered professional
                                                              engineer, would be responsible for the site supervision.
                                                                   A project manager representing the architect would then meet with the site superintend-
                                                              ent and the client on a regular basis to review the construction progress and to respond to any
                                                              issues that require further attention. Many projects would require adjustment in design due to
                                                              unforeseen matters.
                                                                   The structural engineer also visits the construction site periodically to observe the
                                                              progress of the project. These visits are particularly important, as the foundation is being
                                                              built and as the skeleton of the building is being erected. Even though the site superintend-
                                                              ent would make sure the workers are building per given construction drawings and the proj-
                                                              ect manager would walk through the site frequently to ensure the building is constructed as
                                                              designed, sometimes, it takes the eyes of the structural engineer to see if the building is being
                                                              properly built per design specifications. Besides visiting the construction site, the structural
                                                              engineer is also responsible for reviewing the shop drawings submitted by the fabricators
                                                              through the general contractor. The shop drawings show the details of structural compo-
                                                              nents. For example, the steel fabricator must draw to scale the exact beam length to be deliv-
                                                              ered to the site. It also includes the number of holes and hole sizes at each end of the beam
                                                              for connection purposes. Each beam in the project will be assigned a unique identifica-
                                                              tion number so that the steel worker will know exactly the location of each beam in the project.

                                                                   When the project is completed, the project manager will walk through the building with
                                                              the client and the superintendent to go through a “punch” list. The punch list identifies areas
                                                              that need to be completed certain ways or adjusted. Finally, the building inspector must approve
                                                              the building, before it can be occupied.




                                         3.2                  Sustainability in Design*

                                                              This is a good place to say a few words about sustainability in design. In the past few years, you
                                                              have been hearing or reading a great deal about “sustainability.” What does sustainability mean
                                                              and why is important for you, as future engineers, to get a good grasp of it? To start with, it is
                                                              important to know that there is no universal definition for sustainability and sustainable engi-
                                                              neering. It means different things to different professions. However, one of the generally
                                                              accepted definitions is: “design and development that meets the needs of the present without com-
                                                              promising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”
                                                                    As you know by now, engineers contribute to both private and public sectors of our soci-
                                                              ety. In the private sector, they design and produce the goods and services that we use in our daily
                                                              lives; the same goods and services that have allowed us to enjoy a high standard of living. We
                                                              have also explained the role of engineer in the public sector. Engineers support local, state, and
                                                              federal missions such as meeting our infrastructure needs, energy and food security, and national
                                                              defense. Increasingly, because of worldwide socioeconomic trends, environmental concerns,
                                                              and earth’s finite resources, more is expected of engineers.
                                                                    As future engineers, you are expected to design and provide goods and services that
                                                              increase the standard of living and advance health care, while addressing serious environ-
                                                              mental and sustainability concerns. In other words, when you design products and services,
                                                              you must consider the link among earth’s finite resources, environmental, social, ethical,
                                                              technical, and economical factors. Moreover, there is an international competition for engi-
                                                              neers who can come up with solutions that address energy and food security and simultane-

                                                              sustainability — engineers who can apply the sustainability concepts, methods, and tools to
                                                              their problem-solving and decision-making processes — could have serious consequences for
                                                              our future. Because of this fact, in recent years, the engineering organizations including the

                                         3.6                  Common Traits of Good Teams

                                                              More and more, employers are looking for individuals who not only have a good grasp of engi-

                                                              cessful teams have the following components:
                                                              1. The project that is assigned to a team must have clear and realistic goals. These goals must
                                                                 be understood and accepted by all members of the team.
                                                              2. The team should be made up of individuals with complementary expertise, problem solv-
                                                                 ing skills, background, and talent.
                                                              3. The team must have a good leader.
                                                              4. The team leadership and the environment in which discussions take place should promote
                                                                 openness, respect, and honesty.
                                                              5. Team needs and goals should come before individual needs and goals.
                                                              In addition to these characteristics that make up a good team, Dr. R. Meredith Belbin, in his book
                                                              Management Teams: Why They Succeed or Fail, identiﬁes additional roles for good team members.
                                                              A team with members who represent the following secondary roles tends to be very successful.
                                                              The organizer is someone who is experienced and conﬁdent. This person is trusted by mem-
                                                                  bers of the team and serves as a coordinator for the entire project. The organizer does not
                                                                  have to be the smartest or most creative member of the team; however, he or she needs to
                                                                  be good at clarifying goals and advancing decision making.
                                                              The creator is someone who is good at coming up with new ideas, sharing them with other
                                                                  team members, and letting the team develop the ideas further. The creator is also good
                                                                  at solving difﬁcult problems, but may have problems with following certain protocols.
                                                              The gatherer is someone who is enthusiastic and good at obtaining things, looking for possi-
                                                                  bilities, and developing contacts.
                                                              The motivator is someone who is energetic, conﬁdent, and outgoing. The motivator is good
                                                                  at ﬁnding ways around obstacles. Because the motivator is logical and doesn’t like vague-
                                                                  ness, he or she is good at making objective decisions.
                                                              The evaluator is someone who is intelligent and capable of understanding the complete
                                                                  scope of the project. The evaluator is also good at judging outcomes correctly.
                                                              The team worker is someone who tries to get everyone to come together, because he or she
                                                                  does not like friction or problems among team members.
                                                              The solver is someone who is reliable and decisive and can turn concepts into practical solutions.
                                                              The ﬁnisher is someone who can be counted on to ﬁnish his or her assigned task on time.
                                                                  The ﬁnisher is detail orientated and may worry about the team’s progress toward
                                                                  ﬁnishing the assignment.
                                                                     There are many other factors that inﬂuence team performance including:
                                                              • the way a company is organized;
                                                              • how projects are assigned;
                                                              • what resources are available to a team to perform their tasks, and
                                                              • the corporate culture: whether openness, honesty, and respect are promoted.

                                                                        do not have much control over them. However, there are some factors that are internal to the team
                                                                        environment, factors which the team can control. Communication, the decision making process,

                                                   3.7                  Conflict Resolution

                                                                        When a group of people work together, conﬂicts sometimes arise. Conﬂicts could be the result of
                                                                        miscommunication, personality differences, or the way events and actions are interpreted by a
                                                                        member of a team. Managing conﬂicts is an important part of a team dynamic. When it comes to
                                                                        managing conﬂicts, a person’s response may be categorized in one of the following ways. There are
                                                                        those in a team environment who try to avoid conﬂicts. Although this may seem like a good
                                                                        approach, it demonstrates low assertiveness and a low level of cooperation. Under these conditions,
                                                                        the person who is assertive will dominate, making progress as whole difﬁcult. Accommodating team
                                                                        members are highly cooperative, but their low assertiveness could result in poor team decisions.
                                                                        This is because ideas of the most assertive person in the group may not necessarily reﬂect the best
                                                                        solution. Compromising team members demonstrate a moderate level of assertiveness and coopera-

                                                                        eration by the team. With this approach, instead of pointing a ﬁnger at someone and blaming an
                                                                        individual for the problem, the conﬂict is treated as a problem to be solved by the team. The team
                                                                        proposes solutions, means of evaluation, and perhaps combines solutions to reach an ideal solution.
                                                                             However, in order to reach a resolution to a problem, a plan with clear steps must be laid
                                                                        out. Good communication is an integral part of any conﬂict resolution. One of the most impor-

                                                                        without misunderstanding. Team members must listen to each other. Good listeners do not
                                                                        interrupt; they allow the speaker to feel at ease and do not get angry or criticize. You may want
                                                                        to ask relevant questions to let the speaker know that you really are listening.
                                                                             Now you have some idea about teamwork and what makes successful teams; next we will

                                                   3.8                  Project Scheduling and Task Chart

                                                                        Project scheduling is a process that engineering managers use to ensure that a project is completed
                                                                        on time and within the allocated budget. A good schedule will assign an adequate amount of time
                                                                        for various project activities. It will also make use of personnel and the available resources for

                                                              In the early days, trade information and invention were kept in the family and passed on from
                                                              one generation to the next. For example, when a plow maker came up with a better design, he
                                                              kept the details of the design to himself and shared the speciﬁcations of the new invention only
                                                              with his family, including son(s), brother(s), and so on. The new designs and inventions stayed
                                                              in the family to protect the business and to prevent others from duplicating the inventor’s
                                                              design. However, new designs and inventions need to be shared if they are to bring about
                                                              improvements in everyone’s lives. At the same time the person(s) who comes up with a new idea
                                                              should beneﬁt from it. Traded information and invention, if not protected, can be stolen. So
                                                              you can see that, in order for a government to promote new ideas and inventions, it must also
                                                              provide means for protecting others from stealing someone’s new ideas and inventions, which
                                                              are considered intellectual property.
                                                                   Patents, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights are examples of means by which intel-
                                                              lectual property is protected by United States laws.

                                                                        or selling your invention, you may ﬁle for a patent with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce.
                                                                        The right given by the patent in the language of the statute and of the grant itself includes,

                                                                        use, or sell the invention, but it excludes others from making, using, or selling the invention.
                                                                        For a new patent, an invention is protected for a term of 20 years from the date on which the

                                                                             The U.S. Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce recommends that all prospective applicants retain
                                                                        the services of a registered patent attorney or patent agent to prepare and execute their appli-

                                                                        for either 17 years from the time it was granted or 20 years from the earliest ﬁling date,

                                                                        design patent protects the way an item looks.

                                                                        Trademark and Service Mark A trademark is a name, word, or symbol that a company uses to
                                                                        distinguish its products from others. It is important to note that the trademark right issued to
                                                                        a company excludes others from using the same or similar mark, but it does not prevent other
                                                                        companies from making the same or similar products. Coke® and Pepsi® are examples of sim-
                                                                        ilar products with different trademarks. A service mark is a name, word, or symbol that a com-
                                                                        pany uses to distinguish its services from others. A service mark is the same as a trademark,
                                                                        except that it applies to a service rather than a product.

                                                                        Copyright Copyright is a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States to the
                                                                        authors of “original works of authorship.” The copyright laws cover literary, dramatic, musical,
                                                                        artistic, and other types of intellectual works and is obtainable for both published and unpub-

                                                                        content or the subject matter of their work. For example, an author can write a book about the
                                                                        fundamentals of physics. The copyright law protects the author’s work from others copying the
                                                                        exact way things were explained or described. It does not prevent others from writing another
                                                                        book about the same fundamentals of physics, nor does it prevent others from using the fun-
                                                                        damental laws of physics. For a work created after January 1, 1978, the copyright laws protect
                                                                        it for a term that is equal to the author’s life plus 70 years after the author’s death. For a piece
                                                                        of work that has two or more authors, the term extends to the last surviving author’s life plus

                                                                        would protect an author’s work throughout the world.

                                                              Why Do We Need Standards and Codes?
                                                              Standards and codes have been developed over the years by various organizations to ensure

                                                              tive standards for safe food supplies, safe structures, safe water systems, safe and reliable elec-
                                                              trical systems, safe and reliable transportation systems, safe and reliable communication
                                                              systems, and so on. In addition, standards and codes ensure uniformity in the size of parts and
                                                              components that are made by various manufacturers around the world. In today’s globally
                                                              driven economy where parts for a product are made in one place and assembled somewhere
                                                              else, there exists an even greater need than ever before for uniformity and consistency in parts
                                                              and components and in the way they are made. These standards ensure that parts manufac-
                                                              tured in one place can easily be combined with parts made in other places on an assembly line.
                                                              An automobile is a good example of this concept. It has literally thousands of parts that are
                                                              manufactured by various companies in different parts of the United States and the world,
                                                              and all of these parts must ﬁt together properly.
                                                                    To shed more light on why we need standards and codes, let us consider products that we
                                                              all are familiar with, for example, shoes or shirts. In the United States, you are familiar with shoe
                                                              sizes of 9, 10, or 11 and so on, as shown in Table 3.5. In Europe, the standard shoe sizes are
                                                              43, 44, or 45 and so on. Similarly, the standard shirt sizes in the United States are 15, 1512 , or 16
                                                              and so on, whereas in Europe the standard shirt sizes are 38, 39, or 41 and so on. If a shirt
                                                              manufacturer in Europe wants to sell shirts in the United States, it has to label them such that
                                                              people understand the sizes so that they can choose a shirt of the correct size. Conversely, if a shoe
                                                              manufacturer from the United States wants to sell shoes in Europe, it has to label them such that
                                                              the shoe sizes are understood by European customers. Would it not be easier if every shirt or
                                                              shoe manufacturer in the world used uniform size identiﬁcations to eliminate the need for cross
                                                              referencing? These simple examples demonstrate the need for uniformity in the size and the
                                                              way products are labeled. Now, think about all possible parts and components that are manu-
                                                              factured every day by thousands of companies around the world: parts and components such as
                                                              bolts, screws, nuts, cables, tubes, pipes, beams, gears, paints, adhesives, springs, wires, tools, lum-
                                                              ber, fasteners, and so on. You see that if every manufacturer built products using its own stan-

                                        3.14                  Drinking Water Standards in the United States

                                                              The U.S Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets the standards for the maximum level of
                                                              contaminants that can be in our drinking water and still be considered safe to drink. Basically,
                                                              the EPA sets two standards for the level of water contaminants: (1) the maximum contaminant
                                                              level goal (MCLG) and (2) the maximum contaminant level (MCL). The MCLG represents
                                                              the maximum level of a given contaminant in the water that causes no known harmful health
                                                              effects. On the other hand, the MCL, which may represent slightly higher levels of contami-

                                                              to set MCL close to MCLG, but this goal may not be attainable because of economic or tech-
                                                              nical reasons. Examples of drinking water standards are shown in Table 3.8.

                                                              health, but also affect our climate. It may trigger the onset of global warming that could lead
                                                              to unpleasant natural events. Because we all contribute to this problem, we need to be aware of
                                                              the consequences of our lifestyles and ﬁnd ways to reduce pollution. We could carpool or take
                                                              public transportation when going to work or school. We should not leave our cars running idle
                                                              for long periods of time, and we can remind others to consume less energy. We should conserve
                                                              energy around home and school. For example, turn off the light in a room that is not in use.
                                                              When at home, in winter, set the thermostat at 65 F or slightly lower and wear a sweater to
                                                              feel warm. During summer, at home set the air-conditioning thermostat at 78 F or slightly
                                                              higher. By consuming less energy and driving less we can help our environment and reduce

                                                                        sons. (1) In order to save energy we are building tight houses that have lower air inﬁltration or
                                                                        exﬁltration compared to older structures. In addition, the ventilation rates have also been

                                                                        built homes that could give off harmful vapors. (3) We are using more chemical pollutants,
                                                                        such as pesticides and household cleaners.
                                                                              As shown in Table 3.9, indoor pollutants can be created by sources within the building or

                                                                        the ﬂoor late on Friday afternoons to avoid exposing too many occupants to harmful vapors.

                                                                        the air that is circulated through the building is conditioned by heating, cooling, humidifying, or

                                                              air ﬂow around a building envelope that is dictated by wind patterns could also affect the air ﬂow
                                                              pattern within the building as well. When looking at air ﬂow patterns, the important concept to
                                                              keep in mind is that air will always move from a high-pressure region to a low-pressure region.

                                                              Methods to Manage Contaminants
                                                              There are several ways to control the level of contaminants: (1) source elimination or removal,
                                                              (2) source substitution, (3) proper ventilation, (4) exposure control, and (5) air cleaning.
                                                                   A good example of source elimination is not allowing people to smoke inside the building
                                                              or not allowing a car engine to run idle near a building’s outdoor air intake. In other words,
                                                              eliminate the source before it spreads out! It is important for engineers to keep that idea in
                                                              mind when designing the HVAC systems for a building—avoiding placing the outdoor air
                                                              intakes near loading docks or dumpsters, for example. A good example of source substitution
                                                              is to use a gentle cleaning product rather than a product that gives off harmful vapors when
                                                              cleaning bathrooms and kitchens. Local exhaust control means removing the sources of pollu-

                                                              ing. Everyday examples include use of an exhaust fan in restrooms to force out harmful
                                                              contaminants. Fume hoods are another example of local exhaust removal in many laboratories.
                                                              Clean outdoor air can also be mixed with the inside air to dilute the contaminated air. The

                                   Deﬁne the purpose of the brainstorming session and the ground rules.
                                   Examples of ground rules: no criticism of ideas as they are being presented,
                                      one person talks at one time and for an agreed upon period.
                                   Choose a facilitator to keep track of ground rules.
                                   Record all ideas where everyone can see them.
                                   Don’t worry about looking foolish, record all your ideas.
                                   It is a good practice not to associate a person with an idea. Think of each idea
                                      as a group idea.

             The health service expansion consisted of a physician office building and a clinic.
             The physician office building (POB) was to attach to the existing hospital with

             surrounding communities. To better serve the people in these communities, the
             Board of Directors decided to build a new clinic.

                        the designer consulted with the structural engineer on information such as max-
                        imum span length of steel beams. This information would help the architect, con-
                        tractor, and owner to determine a good design and estimated project cost.



                        Step 5: Design Development (DD) Phase
                        In the design development (DD) phase, the architect designer laid out the loca-
                        tions, sizes, and orientations of the reception areas, examination rooms, labora-
                        tories, business administration offices, maintenance facilities, entrances to the
                        physician office building and the street. The arrangement of these rooms along
                        with the maximum span length of steel beams are used to determine the locations
                        of supporting columns. These column locations are the basis the architect used
                        to set-up the gridlines. Gridlines are a set of lines running in two directions. As
                        a convention, one set of lines is named in alphabetical order. The second set of
                        lines is named in numerical sequence. When a new gridline is inserted between
                        two existing lines, the new line would either be name C.# or 3.# depending on
                        the direction of this new gridline. The “#” sign represents a number between 1
                        and 9 depending on the relative location of the new line with respect to the two
                        existing ones. Gridlines are used by the design and construction teams to refer-
                        ence the location of all components in the project.
                             The structural engineer provided the size of major support components of
                        the building such as beams, columns, and foundations. Non-load bearing com-
                        ponents would be neglected in this phase. However, the contractor would
                        include them in the cost estimate. The mechanical and electrical engineers then
                        provided their preliminary mechanical and electrical designs.
                             A set of architectural drawings with superimposed structural, mechanical, and                     engineer at the architects provided design information to the engineer for the
                        electrical information was then provided to the clinic from the contractor. Through                    physician office building.

                        specifications pertinent to the group. Some building codes requirements included
                        the number of handicap parking spaces, number of exits and their locations, and
                        minimum dimensions of public areas and corridors, in addition to safety require-
                        ments set in the engineering specifications.
                             During this phase, the civil engineer was responsible for the grading of the
                        surface outside the building such as parking lot, sidewalk, handicap parking signs
                        and other signs, drainage of the paved surfaces to the storm water line, connec-
                        tions from the clinic to the city water line and sewer line.
                             The structural engineer was responsible for the design of all the load bearing
                        and non-load bearing components and connections. Some of the designs included
                        the sizing of steel beams, steel columns, isolated reinforced concrete footings,
                        bracing necessary to support wind load, steel joists to support the roof and snow
                        loads. In addition, the structural engineers also provided additional design details
                        to support the roof top unit (mechanical system for heating and air conditioning)
                        and x-ray equipment. The documentation of the structural design included a set
                        of very detailed drawings of the layout of the beams, columns, and their sizes;
                        steel joist sizes and spacing; connections between beams and columns, joists and
                        beams, columns and footings, etc; steel reinforcing details of the footings; masonry
                        wall sizes and steel reinforcements, metal studs spacing. The structural drawings
                        also included special details to support door and window openings, and other
                        architectural components such as canopy at entrances.

                        The marketing department at Johnson Outdoors recognized the growing
                        interest in environmentally friendly power sources for their boating industry.
                        Johnson Outdoors is the leading manufacturer of outdoor recreational equipment
                        in the world. The engineering research and development and manufacturing
                        facilities are located in Mankato, MN and the headquarters is located in
                        Racine, Wisconsin.



                        Step 1: Recognizing the Need
                        for a Product or a Service
                        As stated above, the marketing department at Johnson Outdoors recognized the
                        growing interest in environmentally friendly power sources for their boating
                        industry. To better serve the consumers and environment, the marketing depart-
                        ment contacted the engineering department to discuss the feasibility of devel-
                        oping new generation of motors that are environmentally friendly. Increasingly,
                        more states were enacting regulations banning the use of gasoline boat motors in
                        public water ways including lakes and rivers.



                        Step 2: Problem Definition                                                                             Exploded diagram of motor.
                        and Understanding
                        After the marketing people met with the engineers, the details of the project
                        requirements were defined. The design specifications included – the motor had
                        to move a 17 feet long Pontoon at a speed of 5 mph minimum. The motor had
                        to run at least for 2 hours on full battery charge. In addition, the boat operator                     Step 6: Evaluation

                                                                                                                               acceleration and position time functions were determined mathematically and
                        The engineers checked their existing design inventory to determine if a motor                          compared to competitors’ motors.
                        already exists that would meet some or all requirements. Moreover, a mechani-
                        cal engineering student intern was commissioned to look at state regulations con-
                        cerning the use of gasoline vs. electric boat motors.



                        Step 4: Conceptualization
                        During this phase of the design process, the engineering designers (twelve of
                        them) met on weekly basis to brain storm and bounce ideas off each other.
                        They also reviewed the information that was gathered in Step 3, and devel-
                        oped few concepts to pursue further. An additional idea that surfaced was the
                        use of an electric linear actuator in place of a hydraulic actuator. This idea
                        was pursued further because the potential leaks associated with hydraulic
                        actuators.



                        Step 5: Synthesis
                        During this phase of design, the design engineers began to consider details. They
                        consulted pertinent codes and standards to make sure that their design was in
                        compliance. Most of the design work was done in ProE® and prototypes were
                        built in machine and electrical labs. Both technicians and engineers were involved
                        in the fabrication of the prototypes. An interesting result of this project was that
                        the unique design of the propeller required the use of a manufacturing process
                        known as investment casting.

                                                              Before we discuss some of the common engineering presentation formats, let us say a few words
                                                              about the basic steps involved in the solution of an engineering problem. There are four basic
                                                              steps that must be followed when analyzing an engineering problem: (1) deﬁning the problem,
                                                              (2) simplifying the problem by assumptions and estimations, (3) performing the solution or
                                                              analysis, and (4) verifying the results.

                                                                        Before you can obtain an appropriate solution to a problem, you must ﬁrst thoroughly under-
                                                                        stand the problem itself. There are many questions that you need to ask before proceeding to
                                                                        determining a solution. What is it exactly that you want to analyze? What do you really know
                                                                        about the problem, or what are some of the things known about the problem? What are you
                                                                        looking for? What exactly are you trying to ﬁnd a solution to?
                                                                             Taking time to understand the problem completely at the beginning will save lots of time later
                                                                        and help to avoid a great deal of frustration. Once you understand the problem, you should be able
                                                                        to divide any given problem into two basic questions: What is known? and What is to be found?


                                                                        Step 2: Simplifying the Problem
                                                                        Before you can proceed with the analysis of the problem, you may ﬁrst need to simplify it.

                                                                        Assumptions and Estimations Once you have a good understanding of the problem, you should
                                                                        then ask yourself this question: Can I simplify the problem by making some reasonable and log-
                                                                        ical assumptions and yet obtain an appropriate solution? Understanding the physical laws and
                                                                        the fundamental concepts, as well as where and when to apply them and their limitations, will
                                                                        beneﬁt you greatly in making assumptions and solving the problem. It is very important as you
                                                                        take different engineering classes in the next few years that you develop a good grasp of the

                                                                        Step 3: Performing the Solution or Analysis
                                                                        Once you have carefully studied the problem, you can proceed with obtaining an appropriate
                                                                        solution. You will begin by applying the physical laws and fundamental concepts that govern
                                                                        the behavior of engineering systems to solve the problem. Among the engineering tools in your
                                                                        toolbox you will ﬁnd mathematical tools. It is always a good practice to set up the problem in
                                                                        symbolic or parametric form, that is, in terms of the variables involved. You should wait until
                                                                        the very end to substitute for the given values. This approach will allow you to change the value
                                                                        of a given variable and see its inﬂuence on the ﬁnal result. The difference between numerical
                                                                        and symbolic solutions is explained in more detail in Section 6.5.

                                                                        Step 4: Verifying the Results
                                                                        The ﬁnal step of any engineering analysis should be the veriﬁcation of results. Various sources of
                                                                        error can contribute to wrong results. Misunderstanding a given problem, making incorrect
                                                                        assumptions to simplify the problem, applying a physical law that does not truly ﬁt the given prob-

                                                                        this additional question: What if I change one of the given parameters. How would that change

                                                              We communicate orally to each other all the time. Informal communication is part of our
                                                              everyday life. We may talk about sports, weather, what is happening around the world, or a
                                                              homework assignment. Some people are better at expressing themselves than others are.
                                                              Sometimes we say things that are misunderstood and the consequences could be unpleasant.
                                                              When it comes to formal presentations, there are certain rules and strategies that you need
                                                              to follow. Your oral presentation may show the results of all your efforts regarding a project
                                                              that you may have spent months or a year to develop. If the listener cannot follow how a
                                                              product was designed, or how the analysis was performed, then all your efforts become
                                                              insigniﬁcant. It is very important that all information be conveyed in a manner easily under-
                                                              stood by the listener.
                                                                    The oral technical presentation in many ways is similar to a written one. You need to be
                                                              well organized and have an outline of your presentation ready, similar to the format for a writ-
                                                              ten report. It may be a good idea to write down what you are planning to present. Remember
                                                              it is harder to erase or correct what you say after you have said it than to write it down on a piece
                                                              of paper and correct it before you say it. You want to make every effort to ensure that what is
                                                              said (or sent) is what is understood (or received) by the listener.
                                                                    Rehearse your presentation before you deliver it to a live audience. You may want to ask a
                                                              friend to listen and provide helpful suggestions about your style of presentation, delivery, con-
                                                              tent of the talk, and so on.
                                                                    Present the information in a way that is easily understood by your audience. Avoid using
                                                              terminology or phrases that may be unfamiliar to listeners. You should plan so that you won’t
                                                              overexplain key concepts and ideas, because those who are really interested in a speciﬁc area of
                                                              your talk can always ask questions later.
                                                                    Try to keep your talk to about half an hour or less because the attention span of most
                                                              people is about 20 to 30 minutes. If you have to give a longer talk, then you may want to
                                                              mix your presentation with some humor or tell some interesting related story to keep your
                                                              audience’s attention. Maintain eye contact with all of your audience, not just one or two
                                                              people. Don’t ever have your back to the audience for too long! Use good visual aids. Use
                                                              presentation software such as PowerPoint to prepare your talk. When possible, incorporate
                                                              charts, graphs, animated drawings, short videos, or a model. When available, to demon-

                                                                        PowerPoint to generate and organize your slides showing text, charts, graphs, and video
                                                                        clips. With PowerPoint, you can also create supplementary materials (such as handouts) for
                                                                        your audience and preparatory notes for your presentation. PowerPoint offers a number of
                                                                        attractive templates and layout options that you can use. Moreover, for formal presentations,
                                                                        you may want to include your university or organization logo and the date on the bottom
                                                                        of every slide in your presentation. As you may know, to do this, you need to create a slide
                                                                        master first. Animation is yet another way of adding visual and sound effects to your slides.
                                                                        For example, you can show a bulleted list of items one at a time or you can have each item
                                                                        fade away as you move to the next item. Slide transition options can also give your slide pre-
                                                                        sentations sound and visual effects as one slide disappears and the next slide appears. You
                                                                        may also consider using action buttons, which allow you to move to a specific slide in
                                                                        another PowerPoint file, Word document, or Excel file, without having to leave your cur-
                                                                        rent presentation to access the file. The action button is linked to the file, and upon click-
                                                                        ing it, you automatically will go to this file containing the desired slide or document.
                                                                        Finally, as we said earlier, after you prepare your presentation, you need to rehearse your
                                                                        presentation before you deliver it to a live audience. Another reason for rehearsing your
                                                                        presentation is that, typically, engineering presentations must be made within an allotted

                                                                        presentation.

                                beyond building bridges! I promised my teacher I’d con-                                      and received a Ph.D. in structural engineering in 1983. But

                                                              As eloquently stated in the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) code of
                                                              ethics, “Engineering is an important and learned profession. As members of this profes-

                                                              Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people. Accord-

                                                              equity; and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare.
                                                              Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior which requires adher-

                                                              importance of engineering ethics and will present the National Society of Professional

                                         5.1                  Engineering Ethics

                                                              Ethics refers to the study of morality and the moral choices that we all have to make in our lives.
                                                              Professional societies, such as medical and engineering, have long established guidelines, stan-
                                                              dards, and rules that govern the conduct of their members. These rules are also used by the
                                                              members of the board of ethics of the professional organization to interpret ethical dilemmas
                                                              that are submitted by a complainant.
                                                                    As we discussed in Chapter 1, engineers design many products, including cars, comput-
                                                              ers, aircraft, clothing, toys, home appliances, surgical equipment, heating and cooling equip-
                                                              ment, health care devices, tools and machines that make various products. Engineers also design
                                                              and supervise the construction of buildings, dams, highways, and mass transit systems. They also
                                                              design and supervise the construction of power plants that supply power to manufacturing
                                                              companies, homes, and ofﬁces. Engineers play a signiﬁcant role in the design and maintenance
                                                              of nations’ infrastructures, including communication systems, utilities, and transportation.
                                                              Engineers are involved in coming up with ways of increasing crop, fruit, and vegetable yields
                                                              along with improving the safety of our food products.
                                                                    As you can see, people rely quite heavily on engineers to provide them with safe and reli-
                                                              able goods and services. There is no room for mistakes or dishonesty in engineering! Mistakes
                                                              made by engineers could cost not only money but also more importantly lives. Think about the
                                                              following: An incompetent and unethical surgeon could cause at most the death of one person
                                                              at one time (when a pregnant woman dies on the operating table, two deaths may result),
                                                              whereas an incompetent and unethical engineer could cause the deaths of hundreds of people
                                                              at one time. If an unethical engineer in order to save money designs a bridge or a part for an
                                                              airplane that does not meet the safety requirements, hundreds of people’s lives are at risk!
                                                                    You realize that there are jobs where a person’s mistake could be tolerated. For example, if
                                                              a waiter brings you Coke instead of the Pepsi that you ordered, or instead of french fries brings

                                                              without any harm to anyone. But if an incompetent or unethical engineer incorrectly designs

                                                             From NSPE *

                                                              The following is an ethics-related case that was brought before NSPE’s Board of ethics review.




                                                              Facts

                                                              Engineer A is a licensed professional engineer and a principal in a large-sized engineering
                                                              ﬁrm. Engineer B is a graduate engineer who works in industry and has also worked as a student
                                                              in Engineer A’s ﬁrm during one summer. Although Engineer B was employed in Engineer A’s
                                                              ﬁrm, Engineer A did not have direct knowledge of Engineer B’s work. Engineer B is applying
                                                              for licensure as a professional engineer and requests that Engineer A provide him with a
                                                              letter of reference testifying as to Engineer B’s engineering experience and that the engineer
                                                              (Engineer A) was in direct charge of Engineer B. Engineer B was under the assumption that
                                                              Engineer A had personal knowledge of Engineer B’s work. Engineer A inquired about Engineer
                                                              B’s experience from someone who had direct knowledge of Engineer B’s experience. Based on
                                                              the inquiry, Engineer A provides the letter of reference explaining the professional relationship
                                                              between Engineer A and Engineer B.

                                                              Question
                                                              Was it ethical for Engineer A to provide the letter of reference for Engineer B attesting as
                                                              to Engineer B’s engineering experience even though Engineer A did not have direct control of
                                                              Engineer B’s engineering work?

                                                                        The Board has, on prior occasions, considered cases involving the misstatement of credentials
                                                                        of an engineer employed in a ﬁrm. In BER Case No. 92-1, Engineer A was an EIT who was

                                                                        and in its literature listed Engineer A as an electrical engineer. There were other electrical engi-

                                                                   The Board of Ethical Review can certainly understand in the present case the desire of
                                                              Engineer A to assist another engineer (Engineer B) in enhancing career opportunities and

                                                              misleading or deceptive circumstances. Engineers have an ethical obligation to be honest and

                                                              ing such evaluations. Claiming to be in responsible charge of another engineer without actually
                                                              having direct control or personal supervision over that engineer is inconsistent with the letter

                                                                   By providing the report in the manner described, the Board believes Engineer A is send-
                                                              ing the right message to Engineer B about what will be expected of Engineer B and his col-

                                                              Engineer A, a principal in a consulting ﬁrm, in order to improve his chances to become licensed

                                                              Professional engineers must always be mindful that their conduct and actions as professional
                                                              engineers set an example for other engineers, particularly those that are beginning their pro-

                                                              for the letter of recommendation. However, the letter provided by Engineer A was just as ade-

                                                              It was ethical for Engineer A to provide the letter of reference for Engineer B testifying as to

                        Engineers are problem solvers. Successful engineers possess good communication skills and are team
                        players. Successful engineers have a good grasp of FUNDAMENTALS, which they can use to UNDERSTAND and
                        SOLVE many different problems. In Part Two of this book, we will focus on these engineering fundamentals.
                        THESE ARE CONCEPTS THAT EVERY ENGINEER, regardless of his or her area of specialization, SHOULD KNOW.
                        From our observation of our surroundings, we have learned that we need only a few physical quantities to
                        describe events and our surroundings. These quantities are length, time, mass, force, temperature, mole, and
                        electric current. There are also many design variables that are related to these fundamental quantities. For
                        example, length dimension is needed to describe how tall, how long, or how wide something is. The
                        fundamental dimension length and length-related variables, such as area and volume, play important roles in
                        engineering design. To become a successful engineer, you need to ﬁrst fully understand these fundamental
                        and related variables. Then, it is important for you to know how these variables are measured, approximated,
                        calculated, or used in engineering formulas.

                     flight of the Pathfinder,
             a solar-powered, remote-
             piloted aircraft. The Pathfinder
             was constructed of composite
             materials, plastics, and foam to
             create a lightweight aircraft.
             The aircraft has a wingspan of
             30 m and a gross mass of
             221 kg. It is capable of moving
             at a speed of 7 m/s and is
             powered by a solar array that
             runs 6 electric motors which
             turn the propellers. Among
             other activities,      NASA is
             interested in using the aircraft
             to study the upper atmosphere
             without disturbing it.

                                                                        The evolution of the human intellect has taken shape over a period of thousands of years. Men

                                                                        shelter, weapons, water transportation, and means to cultivate and produce more food. More-

                                                                        and their surroundings. For example, the length dimension was needed to describe how tall or
                                                                        how long or how wide something was. They also learned that some things are heavier than
                                                                        other things, so there was a need for another physical quantity to describe that observation: the
                                                                        concept of mass and weight. Early humans did not fully understand the concept of gravity;

                                                                        yet another physical quantity, or physical dimension, that we now refer to as temperature.
                                                                             By now, you understand why we need to formally deﬁne physical variables. The other impor-

                                                              base dimensions to correctly express what we know of the natural world. They are length,

                                                              With the help of these base dimensions we can derive all other necessary physical quantities that

                                                              Throughout the world, there are several systems of units in use today. The most common sys-

                                                              International System (SI) of Units
                                                              We begin our discussion of systems of units with the International System (SI) of units, because
                                                              SI is the most common system of units used in the world. The origin of the present day Inter-

                                                              base units. By promoting the use of the second as a base unit of time in 1832, Carl Friedrich
                                                              Gauss (1777–1855), an important ﬁgure in mathematics and physics, including magnetism

                                                              1946 that the proposal for the ampere as a base unit for electric current was approved by the

                                                              of SI units. Over the years, the list has been extended to include those listed in Table 6.2. SI is
                                                              the most common system of units used in the world.

                                                              base units. For example, the unit for force is the newton. It is derived from Newton’s second law
                                                              of motion. One newton is deﬁned as a magnitude of a force that when applied to 1 kilogram

                                                                   As you can see, as engineering students, and later as practicing engineers, when perform-
                                                              ing analysis, you will ﬁnd a need to convert from one system of units to another. It is very
                                                              important for you at this stage in your education to learn to convert information from one sys-

                                                              to show all your calculations with proper units. This point cannot be emphasized enough!
                                                              Always show the appropriate units that go with your calculations. Example 6.1 shows the
                                                              steps that you need to take to convert from one system of units to another.

                                                              away because it allows us to change a value of a variable such as m 1 or the areas and see what
                                                              happens to the result. For example, using the symbolic approach, we can see clearly that if m 1
                                                              is increased to a value of 200 kg, then m 2 changes to 1800 kg.

                                                              Engineers make measurements and carry out calculations. Engineers then record the results of meas-
                                                              urements and calculations using numbers. Signiﬁcant digits (ﬁgures) represent and convey the extent
                                                              to which recorded or computed data is dependable. For example, consider the instruments shown
                                                              in Figure 6.4. We are interested in measuring the temperature of room air using a thermometer, the
                                                              dimensions of a credit card using an engineering ruler, and the pressure of a ﬂuid in a line using the
                                                              pressure gage shown. As you can see from these examples, the measurement readings fall between
                                                              the smallest scale division of each instrument. In order to take the guess work out of the reading and
                                                              for consistency, we record the measurement to one half of the smallest scale division of the measur-
                                                              ing instrument. One half of the smallest scale division commonly is called the least count of the meas-
                                                              uring instrument. For example, referring to Figure 6.4, it should be clear that the least count for the
                                                              thermometer is 1F (the smallest division is 2F), for the ruler is 0.05 in., and for the pressure gage
                                                              is 0.5 inches of water. Therefore, using the given thermometer, it would be incorrect to record the
                                                              air temperature as 71.25F and later use this value to carry out other calculations. Instead, it should
                                                              be recorded as 71 1F. This way, you are telling the reader or the user of your measurement that
                                                              the temperature reading falls between 70F and 72F. Note the correct way of recording the depend-
                                                              ability of a measurement using the sign and the least count value.
                                                                    As stated earlier, signiﬁcant digits (ﬁgures) represent and convey the extent to which
                                                              recorded or computed data is dependable. Signiﬁcant digits are numbers zero through nine.
                                                              However, when zeros are used to show the position of a decimal point, they are not considered
                                                              signiﬁcant digits. For example, each of the following numbers 175, 25.5, 1.85, and 0.00125 has
                                                              three signiﬁcant digits. Note the zeros in number 0.00125 are not considered as signiﬁcant

                                                              is to offer additional insulation for our bodies so that our body heat does not escape as quickly

                                                              components: the fabric comprising the main body of the coat, insulating material, a liner,

                                                              matics to design, develop, test, and mass-produce products and services that we use in our
                                                              everyday lives. The key concepts that you need to keep in the back of your mind are the phys-
                                                              ical and chemical laws and principles and mathematics.
                                                                    Having had a high school education, you have a pretty good idea of what we mean by math-
                                                              ematics. But what do we mean by physical laws? Well, the universe, including the earth that we
                                                              live on, was created a certain way. There are differing opinions as to the origin of the universe.
                                                              Was it put together by God, or did it start with a big bang? We won’t get into that discussion
                                                              here. But we have learned through observation and by the collective effort of those before us
                                                              that things work a certain way in nature. For example, if you let go of something that you are
                                                              holding in your hand, it will fall to the ground. That is an observation that we all agree upon.

                                                                        We can use words to explain our observations or use another language, such as mathematics, to
                                                                        express our ﬁndings. Sir Isaac Newton (1642 –1727) formulated that observation into a useful
                                                                        mathematical expression that we know as the universal law of gravitational attraction.
                                                                               An important point to remember is that the physical laws are based on observations. More-
                                                                        over, we use mathematics and basic physical quantities to express our observations in the form
                                                                        of a law. Even so, to this day we may not fully understand why nature works the way it does.
                                                                        We just know it works. There are physicists who spend their lives trying to understand on a
                                                                        more fundamental basis why nature behaves the way it does. Some engineers may focus on
                                                                        investigating the fundamentals, but most engineers use fundamental laws to design things.
                                                                               As another example, when you place some hot object in contact with a cold object, the hot
                                                                        object cools down while the cold object warms up until they both reach an equilibrium tem-
                                                                        perature somewhere between the two initial temperatures. From your everyday experience, you
                                                                        know that the cold object does not get colder while the hot object gets hotter! Why is that? Well,
                                                                        it is just the way things work in nature! The second law of thermodynamics, which is based on
                                                                        this observation, simply states that heat ﬂows spontaneously from a high-temperature region to
                                                                        a low-temperature region. The object with the higher temperature (more energetic) transfers
                                                                        some of its energy to the low-temperature (less-energetic) object. When you put some ice cubes
                                                                        in a glass of warm soda, the soda cools down while the ice warms up and eventually melts away.
                                                                        You may call this “sharing resources.” Unfortunately, we as people do not follow this law closely
                                                                        when it comes to social issues.
                                                                               To better understand the second law of thermodynamics, consider another example. Some
                                                                        of you may have young children or young brothers and sisters. If you placed the child with
                                                                        some toys in a room that is tidied up and orderly, let the child play with the toys for a while,
                                                                        then came back in a few minutes, you would ﬁnd toys scattered all over the room in a disorderly
                                                                        way. Why won’t you ﬁnd toys put away nicely? Well, that is because things work spontaneously
                                                                        in a certain direction in nature. These two examples demonstrate the second law of thermody-
                                                                        namics. Things in nature work in a certain direction by themselves.

             150            Chapter 6 Fundamental Dimensions and Units

                                                                    Engineers are also good bookkeepers. What do we mean by this? Any of us with a check-
                                                              ing account knows the importance of accurate record keeping. In order to avoid problems, most
                                                              of us keep track of the transactions in terms of payments (debits) and deposits (credits). Good
                                                              bookkeepers can tell you instantly what the balance in their account is. They know they need
                                                              to add to the recorded balance whenever they deposit some money and subtract from the bal-
                                                              ance with every withdrawal from the account. Engineers, like everyone else, need to keep track
                                                              of their accounts. Moreover, similar to bookkeeping a checking account, engineers keep track
                                                              of (bookkeep) physical quantities when analyzing an engineering problem.
                                                                    To better understand this concept, consider the air inside a car tire. If there are no leaks,
                                                              the mass of air inside the tire remains constant. This is a statement expressing conservation of
                                                              mass, which is based on our observations. If the tire develops a leak, then you know from your
                                                              experience that the amount of air within the tire will decrease until you have a ﬂat tire. Fur-
                                                              thermore, you know the air that escaped from the tire was not destroyed; it simply became part
                                                              of the surrounding atmosphere. The conservation of mass statement is similar to a bookkeep-
                                                              ing method that allows us to account for what happens to the mass in an engineering problem.
                                                              What happens if we try to pump some air into the tire that has a hole? Well, it all depends on
                                                              the size of the hole and the pressure and ﬂow rate of the pressurized air available to us. If the
                                                              hole is small, we may be able to inﬂate the tire temporarily. Or the hole may be so large that
                                                              the same amount of air that we put into the tire comes right back out. To completely describe
                                                              all possible situations pertaining to this tire problem, we can express the conservation of mass
                                                              as the rate at which air enters the tire minus the rate at which the air leaves the tire should be equal
                                                              to the rate of accumulation or depletion of air inside the tire. Of course, we will use the physical
                                                              quantity mass along with mathematics to express this statement. We will discuss the conserva-
                                                              tion of mass in more detail in Chapter 9.
                                                                    There are other physical laws based on our observations that we use to analyze engineering
                                                              problems. Conservation of energy is another good example. It is again similar to a bookkeeping
                                                              method that allows us to keep track of various forms of energy and how they may change from one
                                                              form to another. We will spend more time discussing the conservation of energy in Chapter 13.
                                                                    Another important law that all of you have heard about is Newton’s second law of motion.
                                                              If you place a book on a smooth table and push it hard enough, it will move. This is simply the
                                                              way things work. Newton observed this and formulated his observation into what we call
                                                              Newton’s second law of motion. This is not to say that other people had not made this simple
                                                              observation before, but Newton took it a few steps further. He noticed that as he increased the
                                                              mass of the object being pushed, while keeping the magnitude of the force constant (pushing
                                                              with the same effort), the object did not move as quickly. Moreover, he noticed that there was
                                                              a direct relationship between the push, the mass of the object being pushed, and the accelera-
                                                              tion of the object. He also noticed that there was a direct relationship between the direction of
                                                              the force and the direction of the acceleration. Newton expressed his observations using math-
                                                              ematics, but simply expressed, this law states that unbalanced force is equal to mass times accel-
                                                              eration. You will have the opportunity to take physics classes that will allow you to study and
                                                              explore Newton’s second law of motion further. Some of you may even take a dynamics class
                                                              that will focus in greater detail on motion and forces and their relationship. Don’t lose sight of
                                                              the main idea: Physical laws are based on observations.
                                                                    Another important idea to keep in mind is that a physical law may not fully describe all pos-
                                                              sible situations. Statements of physical laws have limitations because we may not fully understand
                                                              how nature works, and thus we may fail to account for all variables that can affect the behavior of

                                                              work on a project in which the noise of a machine is a concern, and you may be asked
                                                              to come up with ways to reduce the level of noise. It may be the case that during the
                                                              four or ﬁve years of your engineering education, you did not take a class in noise con-

                                                              may ﬁrst try to ﬁnd someone who specializes in noise control who could solve the

                                                              and because this is a one-time project, you must come up with a reasonable solution
                                                              yourself. Therefore, you will have to learn something new and learn fast. If you have
                                                              a good grasp of underlying engineering concepts and fundamentals, the learning
                                                              process could be fun and quick. The point of this story is that during the next four
                                                              years you need to make sure that you learn the fundamentals well.

                                                              home to think about the dimension length. Start with your bed: What are its dimensions, how
                                                              far above the ﬂoor is it? What is a typical standard height for steps in a stairway? When you tell
                                                              someone that you own a 32-inch TV, to what dimension are you referring? How high off the

                                                                    You are beginning to see that length is a very important fundamental dimension, and
                                                              it is thus commonly used in engineering products. Coordinate systems are examples of
                                                              another application where length plays an important role. Coordinate systems are used to
                                                              locate things with respect to a known origin. In fact, you use coordinate systems every day,
                                                              even though you don’t think about it. When you go from your home to school or a grocery
                                                              store or to meet a friend for lunch, you use coordinate systems. The use of coordinate sys-
                                                              tems is almost second nature to you. Let’s say you live downtown, and your school is located
                                                              on the northeast side of town. You know the exact location of the school with respect to your
                                                              home. You know which streets to take for what distance and in which directions to move
                                                              to get to school. You have been using a coordinate system to locate places and things most
                                                              of your life, even if you did not know it. You also know the speciﬁc location of objects at
                                                              home relative to other objects or to yourself. You know where your TV is located relative to
                                                              your sofa or bedroom.
                                                                    There are different types of coordinate systems such as rectangular, cylindrical, spherical,
                                                              and so on, as shown in Figure 7.1. Based on the nature of a particular problem, we may use one
                                                              or another. The most common coordinate system is the rectangular, or Cartesian, coordinate
                                                              system (Figure 7.1). When you are going to school from home or meeting a friend for lunch
                                                              you use the rectangular coordinate system. But you may not call it that; you may use the direc-
                                                              tions north, east, west, or south to get where you are going. You can think of the axes of a rect-
                                                              angular coordinate system as aligning with, for example, the east and north direction. People
                                                              who are blind are expert users of rectangular coordinate systems. Because they cannot rely on
                                                              their visual perception, people with a vision disability know how many steps to take and in
                                                              which direction to move to go from one location to another. So to better understand coordi-

                                                              utes and try to go from your bedroom to the bathroom. Note the number of steps you had to
                                                              take and in which directions you had to move. Think about it!

                                                                        or units. There are several systems of units in use in engineering today. We will focus on two of

                                                                        The unit of length in SI is the meter (m). We can use the multiples and fractions of this unit
                                                                        according to Table 6.2. Common multipliers of the meter are micrometer (␮m), millimeter
                                                                        (mm), centimeter (cm), and kilometer (km). Recall from our discussion of units and multipli-

                                                              You have all seen or used a 2 ⫻ 4 piece of lumber. If you were to measure the dimensions of the
                                                              cross section of a 2 ⫻ 4, you would ﬁnd that the actual width is less than 2 inches (approximately
                                                              1.5 inches) and the height is less than 4 inches (approximately 3.5 inches). Then why is it referred
                                                              to as a “2 by 4”? Manufacturers of engineering parts (See Figure 7.4) use round numbers so that it
                                                              is easier for people to remember the size and thus more easily refer to a speciﬁc part. The 2 ⫻ 4 is
                                                              called the nominal size of the lumber. If you were to investigate other structural members, such as
                                                              I-beams, you would also note that the nominal size given by the manufacturer is different from the
                                                              actual size. You will ﬁnd a similar situation for pipes, tubes, screws, wires, and many other engi-
                                                              neering parts. Agreed-upon standards are followed by manufacturers when providing information
                                                              about the size of the parts that they make. But manufacturers do provide actual sizes of parts in addi-
                                                              tion to nominal sizes. This fact is important because, as you will learn in your future engineering
                                                              classes, you need the actual size of parts for various engineering calculations. Examples of nominal
                                                              sizes versus actual sizes of some engineering parts are given in Table 7.2.

                                                              has more surface exposed to the liquid. You may have also noticed that given the same amount
                                                              of meat, it takes longer for a roast of beef to cook than it takes stew. Again, it is because the stew
                                                              has more surface area exposed to the liquid in which it is being cooked. So next time you are
                                                              planning to make some mashed potatoes, make sure you ﬁrst cut the potatoes into smaller
                                                              pieces. The smaller the pieces, the sooner they will cook. Of course, the reverse is also true.
                                                              That is, if you want to reduce the heat loss from something, one way of doing this would be to
                                                              reduce the exposed surface area. For example, when we feel cold we naturally try to curl up,
                                                              which reduces the surface area exposed to the cold surroundings. You can tell by observing
                                                              nature that trees take advantage of the effect and importance of surface area. Why do trees have
                                                              lots of leaves rather than one big leaf ? It is because they can absorb more solar radiation that
                                                              way. Surface area is also important in engineering problems related to mass transfer. Your par-

                                                              hung over the clothesline in such way that they had a maximum area exposed to the air. Bed-
                                                              sheets, for example, were stretched out fully across the clothesline.
                                                                   Let us now investigate the relationship between a given volume and exposed surface area. Con-

                                                              cube? 6 m2. If we divide each dimension of this cube by half, we get 8 smaller cubes with the
                                                              dimensions of 0.5 m ⫻ 0.5 m ⫻ 0.5 m, as shown in Figure 7.8. What is the total volume of the 8
                                                              smaller cubes? It is still 1 m3. What is the total exposed surface area of the cubes? Each cube now
                                                              has an exposed surface area of 1.5 m2, which amounts to a total exposed surface area of 12 m2.
                                                                   Let us proceed with dividing the dimensions of our 1 m ⫻ 1 m ⫻ 1 m original cube into
                                                              even smaller cubes with the dimensions of 0.25 m ⫻ 0.25 m ⫻ 0.25 m. We will now have
                                                              64 smaller cubes, and we note that the total volume of the cubes is still 1 m3. However, the
                                                              surface area of each cube is 0.375 m2, leading to a total surface area of 24 m2. Thus, the same
                                                              cube divided into 64 smaller cubes now has an exposed surface area that is four times the origi-

                                                                        the area formulas shown in Table 7.4. It is a common practice to refer to these simple areas as

                                                                        The Trapezoidal Rule You can approximate the planar areas of an irregular shape with reason-

                                                              imation can be improved by using more trapezoids. This approach will reduce the value of h
                                                              and thus improve the accuracy of the approximation.
                                                              Counting the Squares There are other ways to approximate the surface areas of irregular shapes.
                                                              One such approach is to divide a given area into small squares of known size and then count the
                                                              number of squares. This approach is depicted in Figure 7.12. You then need to add to the areas
                                                              of the small squares the leftover areas, which you may approximate by the areas of small triangles.

                                                              area(s) around the unknown shape and then approximate and subtract the unwanted smaller
                                                              areas. An example of such a situation is shown in Figure 7.13. Also keep in mind that for
                                                              symmetrical areas you may make use of the symmetry of the shape. Approximate only 1/2, 1/4,
                                                              or 1/8 of the total area, and then multiply the answer by the appropriate factor.

                                                              Volume is another important physical quantity, or physical variable, that does not get enough
                                                              respect. We live in a three-dimensional world, so it is only natural that volume would be an
                                                              important player in how things are shaped or how things work. Let us begin by considering the
                                                              role of volume in our daily lives. Today you may have treated yourself to a can of soda, which
                                                              on average contains 12 ﬂuid ounces or 355 milliliters of your favorite beverage. You may have
                                                              driven a car whose engine size is rated in liters. For example, if you own a Buick Park Avenue,
                                                              its engine size is 3.8 liters. Depending on the size of your car, it is also safe to say that in order
                                                              to ﬁll the gas tank you need to put in about 15 to 20 gallons (57 to 77 liters) of gasoline. We
                                                              also express the gas consumption rate of a car in terms of so many miles per gallon of gasoline.
                                                              Doctors tell us that we need to drink at least 8 glasses of water (approximately 2.5 to 3 liters) a
                                                              day. We breathe in oxygen at a rate of approximately 1.6 ft3/h (0.0453 m3/h). Of course, as you
                                                              would expect, the volume of oxygen consumption or carbon dioxide production depends on
                                                              the level of physical activity. The oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and pul-

                                                                    We each consume on average about 20 to 40 gallons of water per day for personal groom-
                                                              ing and cooking. Volume also plays an important role in food packaging and pharmaceutical
                                                              applications. For example, a large milk container is designed to hold a gallon of milk. When
                                                              administering drugs, the doctor may inject you with so many milliliters of some medicine.
                                                              Many other materials are also packaged so that the package contains so many liters or gallons
                                                              of something, for example, a gallon can of paint. Clearly, we use volume to express quantities
                                                              of various ﬂuids that we consume. Volume also plays a signiﬁcant role in many other engi-
                                                              neering concepts. For example, the density of a material represents how light or heavy a mate-
                                                              rial is per unit volume. We will discuss density and other related mass and volume properties
                                                              in Chapter 9. Buoyancy is another engineering principle where volume plays an important role.
                                                              Buoyancy is the force that a ﬂuid exerts on a submerged object. The net upward buoyancy force
                                                              arises from the fact that the ﬂuid exerts a higher pressure at the bottom surfaces of the object

                                                                                             the soda container does not represent a perfect cylinder. If you were to

                                                                              We could have measured the inside volume of the can by ﬁlling the can with water and then
                                                                        pouring the water into a graduated cylinder or beaker to obtain a direct reading of the volume.

                                                                   If you were to report your ﬁndings, you would note that the circular cross section of the
                                                              rod offers the same resistance to bending regardless of the direction of loading. This is because
                                                              the circular cross section has the same distribution of area about an axis going through the cen-

                                                                   Most of you will take a statics class, where you will learn more in depth about the formal

                            ood engineers recognize the role of time
                            in their lives and in calculating speed,
                            acceleration, and flow of traffic, as well
                        as flow of materials and substances. They
                        know what is meant by frequency and period
                        and understand the difference between a
                        steady and a transient process. Good engi-
                        neers have a comfortable grasp of rotational
                        motion and understand how it differs from
                        translational motion.

                                                              In the previous chapter, we considered the role of length and length-related parame-
                                                              ters such as area and volume in engineering analysis and design. In this chapter, we
                                                              will investigate the role of time as a fundamental dimension and other time-related

                                                              and volume ﬂow rate of ﬂuids. Rotational motion is also introduced at the end of this

                                                                        humans needed to devise a means to keep track of shorter time intervals, such as what today

                                                                        The moving shadow of the dial marked the time intervals. Like other human-invented

                                                              design eventually led to smaller clocks and to watches. The oscillation of a pendulum was
                                                              the next advancement in the design of clocks.
                                                                   Quartz clocks eventually replaced the mechanical clocks around the middle of the 20th cen-

                                                              crystal, when subjected to a mechanical pressure, creates an electric ﬁeld. The inverse is also
                                                              true—that is to say, the shape of the crystal changes when it is subjected to an electric ﬁeld.
                                                              These principles are used to design clocks that make the crystal vibrate and generate an electric

                                                              new standard unit of time. The unit of a second is now formally deﬁned as the duration of

                                                              The Need for Time Zones
                                                              You know that the earth rotates about an axis that runs from the South Pole to the North Pole,
                                                              and it takes the earth 24 hours to complete one revolution about this axis. Moreover, from
                                                              studying globes and maps, you may have noticed that the earth is divided into 360 circular arcs
                                                              that are equally spaced from east to west; these arcs are called longitudes. The zero longitude was
                                                              arbitrarily assigned to the arc that passes through Greenwich, England. Because it takes the

                                                              exactly 15 degrees west of Chicago will see the sun in the same exact position one hour later as
                                                              it was observed by another person in Chicago one hour before. The earth is also divided into
                                                              latitudes, which measure the angle formed by the line connecting the center of the earth to the

                                                                        saving time, it will get dark at 8:00 p.m., but with the clocks set forward by one hour, it will

                                                              sequently saving many lives.
                                                                   In 1966, the U.S. Congress passed the Uniform Time Act to establish a system of
                                                              uniform time. Moreover, in 1986, Congress changed the initiation of daylight saving time from
                                                              the last Sunday in April to the ﬁrst Sunday in April. In 2005, Congress approved an amend-
                                                              ment to have daylight saving time start on the second Sunday in March and end on the ﬁrst Sun-

                                                              type of daylight saving schedule. In the European Union countries, the daylight saving begins
                                                              on the last Sunday in March and continues through the last Sunday in October.




                                         8.3                  Periods and Frequencies

                                                              For periodic events, a period is the time that it takes for the event to repeat itself. For example,
                                                              every 365.24 days the earth lines up in exactly the same position with respect to the sun. The
                                                              orbit of the earth around the sun is said to be periodic because this event repeats itself. The
                                                              inverse of a period is called a frequency. For example, the frequency at which the earth goes
                                                              around the sun is once a year.
                                                                   Let us now use other simple examples to explain the difference between period and fre-
                                                              quency. It is safe to assume that most of you do laundry once a week or buy groceries once
                                                              a week. In this case, the frequency of your doing laundry or buying groceries is once a
                                                              week. Or you may go see your dentist once every six months. That is the frequency of your
                                                              dentist visits. Therefore, frequency is a measure of how frequently an event or a process
                                                              occurs, and period is the time that it takes for that event to complete one cycle. Some engi-
                                                              neering examples that include periodic motion are oscillatory systems such as shakers, mix-
                                                              ers, and vibrators. The piston inside a car’s engine cylinder is another good example of
                                                              periodic motion. Your car’s suspension system, the wings of a plane in a turbulent ﬂight,
                                                              or a building being shaken by strong winds may also show some component of periodic
                                                              motion.
                                                                   Consider a simple spring–mass system, as shown in Figure 8.4. The spring–mass system
                                                              shown could represent a very simple model for a vibratory system, such as a shaker or a
                                                              vibrator. What happens if you were to push down on the mass and then let go of it? The mass
                                       Mass                   will oscillate in a manner that manifests itself by an up-and-down motion. If you study
                                                              mechanical vibration, you will learn that the natural undamped frequency of the system is given

                                                              Acceleration provides a measure of how velocity changes with time. Something that moves with

                                                              difference between instantaneous velocity and average velocity. The instantaneous acceleration
                                                              can be obtained from Equation (8.9) by making the time interval smaller and smaller. That is to

                                                              express the angular speed of rotating objects in revolutions per minute (rpm) instead of radi-
                                                              ans per second (rad/s). For example, the rotational speed of a pump impeller may be expressed
                                                              as 1600 rpm. To convert the angular speed value from rpm to rad/s, we make the appropriate
                                                              conversion substitutions.

                                                              In practice, the angular speed of rotating objects is measured using a stroboscope or a

                                                              a dentist’s drill runs at 400,000 rpm; a current state-of-the-art computer hard drive runs at

                                                                   There exists a relationship between linear and angular velocities of objects that not only

                        sion that plays an important
                        role in engineering analysis
                        and design. Mass provides a
                        measure of resistance to
                        motion. Knowledge of mass
                        is important in determining
                        the momentum of moving ob-
                        jects. In engineering, to rep-
                        resent how light or heavy
                        materials are, we use prop-
                        erties such as density and
                        specific gravity.

             230             Chapter 9 Mass and Mass-Related Parameters

                                                              In the Chapters 7 and 8, we explained the role of length, time, and length and time
                                                              dependent quantities such as area, volume, speed, volume flow rate in engineering
                                                              analysis and design. The objective of this chapter is to introduce the concept of mass
                                                              and mass-related quantities encountered in engineering. We will begin by discussing
                                                              the building blocks of all matter, atoms and molecules. We will then introduce the
                                                              concept of mass in terms of a quantitative measure of the amount of atoms possessed
                                                              by a substance. We will then deﬁne and discuss other mass-dependent engineering
                                                              quantities, such as density, speciﬁc gravity, mass moment of inertia, momentum,
                                                              and mass ﬂow rate. In this chapter, we will also consider conservation of mass and
                                                              its application in engineering. Table 6.7 is repeated here to remind you of the role
                                                              of fundamental dimensions and how they are combined to define mass-dependent
                                                              variables such as moment of inertia, momentum, and mass flow rate.

                                                              ample, as you already know, water molecules are made of two atoms of hydrogen and one
                                                              atom of oxygen. A glass of water is made up of billions and billions of homogeneous water
                                                              molecules. Molecules are the smallest portion of a given matter that still possesses its char-

                                                              rounding conditions: solid, liquid, gaseous, or plasma. Let us consider the water that we
                                                              drink every day. As you already know, under certain conditions, water exists in a solid form
                                                              that we call ice. At a standard atmospheric pressure, water exists in a solid form as long its
                                                              temperature is kept under 0⬚C. Under standard atmospheric pressure, if you were to heat the
                                                              ice and consequently change its temperature, the ice would melt and change into a liquid
                                                              form. Under standard pressure at sea level, the water remains liquid up to a temperature of
                                                              100⬚C as you continue heating the water. If you were to carry out this experiment further
                                                              by adding more heat to the liquid water, eventually the liquid water changes its phase from
                                                              a liquid into a gas. This phase of water we commonly refer to as steam. If you had the means
                                                              to heat the water to even higher temperatures, temperatures exceeding 2000⬚C, you would
                                                              ﬁnd that you can break up the water molecules into their atoms, and eventually the atoms
                                                              break up into free electrons and nuclei that we call plasma.
                                                                    Well, what does all this have to do with mass? Mass provides a quantitative measure of
                                                              how many molecules or atoms are in a given object. The matter may change its phase, but its

                                                              indirectly by using how much something weighs. The weight of an object on earth is the force that
                                                              is exerted on the mass due to the gravitational pull of the earth. You are familiar with spring scales
                                                              that measure the weight of goods at a supermarket or bathroom scales at home. Force due to grav-

                                                              that deﬂection. Some weight scales use force transducers consisting of a metallic member that behaves
                                                              like a spring except the deﬂection of the metal member is measured electronically using strain gauges.
                                                              You should understand the difference between weight and mass, and be careful how you use them

                                                              It is important to note that speciﬁc gravity is unitless because it is the ratio of the value of two

                                                              In Chapter 8, we discussed the signiﬁcance of volume ﬂow rate. The mass ﬂow rate is another

                                                              How would you measure the mass ﬂow rate of water coming out of a faucet or a drinking fountain?

                                                              In Equation (9.14), L represents momentum vector, m is mass, and V is the velocity vector.
                                                              Because the velocity of the moving object has a direction, we associate a direction with mo-
                                                              mentum as well. The momentum’s direction is the same as the direction of the velocity vector
                                                              or the moving object. So a 1000-kg car moving north at a rate of 20 m/s has a momentum
                                                              with a magnitude of 20,000 kg ⭈ m/s in the north direction. Momentum is one of those
                                                              physical concepts that are commonly abused by sports broadcasters when discussing sporting
                                                              events. During a timeout period when athletes are standing still and listening to their coaches,
                                                              the broadcaster may say, “Bob, clearly the momentum has shifted, and team B has more
                                                              momentum now going into the fourth quarter.” Using the preceding deﬁnition of momen-
                                                              tum, now you know that relative to earth, the momentum of an object or a person at rest
                                                              is zero!
                                                                    Because the magnitude of linear momentum is simply mass times velocity, something
                                                              with relatively small mass could have a large momentum value, depending on its velocity.
                                                              For example, a bullet with a relatively small mass shot out of a gun can do lots of harm and
                                                              penetrate a surface because of its high velocity. The magnitude of the momentum associ-
                                                              ated with the bullet could be relatively large. You have seen stunt actors falling from the
                                                              top of tall buildings. As the stunt performer approaches the ground, he or she has a rela-
                                                              tively large momentum, so how are injuries avoided? Of course, the stunt performer falls
                                                              onto an air bag and some soft materials that increase the time of contact to reduce the
                                                              forces that act on his or her body. We will discuss the relationship between linear mo-

                                                                        and so on. Let us now look at how engineers may go about keeping track of mass and the asso-
                                                                        ciated bookkeeping procedure (see Figure 9.4). Simply stated, the conservation of mass says that
                                                                        we cannot create or destroy mass. Consider the following example. You are taking a shower in
                                                                        your bathtub. You turn on the water and begin to wash yourself. Let us focus our attention on
                                                                        the tub. With the drain open and clear of any hair and dead skin tissue, the rate at which water
                                                                        comes to the tub from the showerhead is equal to the rate at which water leaves the tub. This is
                                                                        a statement of conservation of mass applied to the water inside the tub. Now what happens if
                                                                        the drain becomes plugged up by hair or dead skin tissue? Many of us have experienced this at
                                                                        one time or another. Liquid Dra-no® time! The rate at which water comes to the tub now is not
                                                                        exactly equal to the rate at which water leaves the tub, which is why the water level in the tub
                                                                        begins to rise. How would you use the conservation of mass principle to describe this situation?

                                                              You can express it this way: The rate at which water comes to the tub is equal to the rate at which
                                                              the water leaves the tub plus the time rate of accumulation of the mass of water within the tub.
                                                                    What happens if you were taking a bath and you had the tub ﬁlled with water? Let us
                                                              say that after you are done taking the bath you open the drain, and the water begins to leave.
                                                              Being the impatient person that you are, you slowly turn on the shower as the tub is being
                                                              drained. Now you notice that the water level is going down but at a slow rate. The rate the
                                                              water is coming into the tub minus the rate at which water is leaving the tub is equal to the rate
                                                              of water depletion (reduction) within the tub.
                                                                    Let us now turn our attention to an engineering presentation of conservation of mass.
                                                              In engineering we refer to the tub as a control volume, because we focus our attention on a speciﬁc
                                                              object occupying a certain volume in space. The control volume could represent the ﬂow bound-
                                                              aries in a pump, or a section of a pipe, or the inside volume of a tank, the ﬂow passage in a com-
                                                              pressor or water heater or the boundaries of a river. We can use the bathtub example to formulate
                                                              a general statement for conservation of mass, which states: The rate at which a ﬂuid enters a con-
                                                              trol volume minus the rate at which the ﬂuid leaves the control volume should be equal to the rate of
                                                              accumulation or depletion of the mass of ﬂuid within the given control volume. There is also a broad
                                                              area in mathematics, operations research, engineering management, and trafﬁc called queuing. It
                                                              is a study of “queues” of people waiting in service lines, products waiting in assembly lines, cars
                                                              waiting in lanes, or digital information waiting to move through computer networks. What hap-
                                                              pens during busy hours at banks, gas stations, or supermarket checkout counters? The lines formed
                                                              by people or cars grow longer. The ﬂow into a line is not equal to the ﬂow out of the line and thus
                                                              the line gets longer. You can think of this in terms of conservation of mass. During busy hours,
                                                              the rate at which people enter a line is not equal to the rate at which people leave the line and thus
                                                              there is a rate of accumulation at the line. This analogy is meant to make you think about other
                                                              issues closely related to the ﬂow of things in everyday life.




             I think I’ll invite my class here
             tomorrow to demonstrate the
             conservation of mass!

                   Example 9.4                                We are interested in determining the mass-flow rate of fuel from the gasoline tank of a small

                                                              every hour?

                                                              The volume-flow rate of fuel for a single car is determined from:

                                                              burned!

                                                              The simple examples given in Figure 10.2 are used to show you the effects of a force’s magni-

                                                              Tendencies of a Force
                                                              Now that you understand the concept of force, let us examine the tendencies of externally applied
                                                              forces. The natural tendency of a force acting on an object, if unbalanced, will be to translate the
                                                              object (move it along) and to rotate it. Moreover, forces acting on an object could squeeze or
                                                              shorten, elongate, bend, or twist the object. The amount by which the object will translate,
                                                              rotate, elongate, shorten, bend, or twist will depend on its support conditions, and material and
                                                              geometric properties (length, area, and area moment of inertia). Machine components, tools,
                                                              parts of the human body, and structural members are generally subjected to push–pull, bend-
                                                              ing, or twisting types of loading. In order to quantify these tendencies in engineering, we define
                                                              terms such as moment, work, impulse, pressure, and stress. Those of you who are studying to

                                                              force. In your own words explain the behavior of each case.

                                                              The newton (N) is the unit of force in SI. One newton is deﬁned as the force that will acceler-

                                                              answer: The water will ﬂow down the inclined surface faster because it has less viscosity. Fluids

                                                              gases increases with increasing temperature, and the viscosity of liquids generally decreases with

                                                              what is the magnitude of the friction force? What should be the magnitude of the horizontal

                                                                     Fmax ⫽ mN ⫽ 10.62 1202 ⫽ 12 newtons
                                                              Since the magnitude of the horizontal force (10 N) is less than the maximum friction force

                                                              object did not move as quickly and had a smaller rate of change of speed. Thus, Newton noticed
                                                              that there was a direct relationship between the push (the force), the mass of the object being
                                                              pushed, and the acceleration of the object. He also noticed that there was a direct relationship
                                                              between the direction of the force and the direction of the acceleration. Newton’s second law
                                                              of motion simply states that the net effect of unbalanced forces is equal to mass times acceler-

                                                              more than one force on an object.

                                                              As we mentioned earlier, the two tendencies of an unbalanced force acting on an object are to
                                                              translate the object (i.e., to move it in the direction of the unbalanced force) and to rotate or
                                                              bend or twist the object. In this section, we will focus our attention on understanding the ten-

                                                              created by forces about various points and axes is important in many engineering analyses. For
                                                              example, all of you have noticed that the street light poles or the trafﬁc light poles are thicker
                                                              near the ground than they are on the top. One of the main reasons for this is that wind loading
                                                              creates a bending moment, which has a maximum value about the base of the pole. Thus, a big-
                                                              ger section is needed at the base to prevent failure. Nature understands the concept of bend-
                                                              ing moments well; that is why trees have big trunks near the ground to support the bending
                                                              moment created by the weight of the branches and the wind loading. Understanding moments,
                                                              or torques, is also important when designing objects that rotate, such as a shaft, gear, or wheel.
                                                                   To better grasp the concept of moment, let us consider a simple example. When you open

                 Fixed Support                                       For a fixed support, the object cannot move up and down,
                                                                     nor can it move sideways, or be bent at the support location

                                                                     the support reaction forces should act downward and to the

                 Pin Support                                         At the support location, the object can not move up and

                  The box in Example 10.7.

                                                                  The SI unit for work is N ⭈ m, which is called joule; thus the unit joule ( J) is deﬁned as the
                                                              work done by a 1-N force through a distance of 1 m.

                                                                     1 joule ⫽ 11 N 2 11 m2

                                                              Students often confuse the concept of work with power. Power represents how fast you want
                                                              to do the work. It is the time rate of doing work, or said another way, it is the work done divided
                                                              by the time that it took to perform it. For instance, in Example 10.7, if we want to lift the box
                                                              in 3 seconds, then the power required is

                                                                                     work   150 J

                                                              Note that 1 J/s is called 1 watt (W). If you wanted to lift the box in 1.5 seconds, then the
                                                              required power to do this task is: 150 J/1.5 s or 100 W. Thus, twice as much power is required.
                                                              It is important to note that the work done in each case is the same; however, the power require-
                                                              ment is different. Remember if you want to do work in a shorter time, then you are going to
                                                              need more power. The shorter the time, the more power required to do that work. We will dis-

                                                              applications, we brieﬂy mentioned the importance of understanding pressure in situations
                                                              such as foundations of buildings, hydraulic systems, and cutting tools. We also said that in

                                                              a distance L 1, while the driven piston (piston 2) moves by a shorter distance, L 2. However, the
                                                              volume of the ﬂuid displaced is constant, as shown in Figure 10.23. Knowing that in an enclosed

                                                              Moreover, a relationship between the speed of the drive piston and the driven piston can be for-

                                                                             Next, we will explain the operation and components of manually activated and pump-driven
                                                                        hydraulic systems. Examples of these types of hydraulic systems are depicted in Figures 10.24(a)
                                                                        and (b). Figure 10.24(a) shows a schematic diagram of a hand-driven hydraulic jack. The system
                                                                        consists of a reservoir, a hand pump, the load piston, a relief valve, and a high-pressure check

                                                                        ﬂuid into the load cylinder, which in turn creates a pressure that is transmitted to the load piston,
                                                                        and consequently the load is raised. To lower the load, the release valve is opened. The amount

                                                                        Of course, the viscosity of the hydraulic ﬂuid and the magnitude of the load will also affect the
                                                                        lowering speed. In the system shown, the ﬂuid reservoir is necessary to supply the line with as

                                                                             The hydraulic system shown in Figure 10.24(b) replaces the hand-activated pump by a

                                                                        voir, as shown. The relief valves shown in Figure 10.24 could be set at desired pressure levels to
                                                                        control the ﬂuid pressure in the lines by allowing the ﬂuid to return to the reservoir as shown.

                                                              This approach is preferred over the direct substitution of values into the equation right away
                                                              because it allows us to change the value of a variable, such as m 1 or the dimensions of the pis-
                                                              tons, and see what happens to the result. For example, using the second approach, we can see
                                                              clearly that if m 1 is increased to a value of 200 kg, then m 2 changes to 1800 kg.

                                                              Geometric properties of an object such as its length, area, and first and second moment of area
                                                              also play significant roles in the way the object responds to a force. As explained previously,
                                                              when an object is subjected to an external force, internal forces are created inside the material
                                                              to hold the material and the components together. Stress provides a measure of the intensity of
                                                              internal forces acting over an area. Consider the situation shown in Figure 10.26. The plate

                                                              components: a horizontal and a vertical component. The tendency of the horizontal compo-

                                                                    The ratio of the normal (vertical) component of the force to the area is called the normal
                                                              stress, and the ratio of the horizontal component of the force (the component of the force that

                                                              is often called pressure.

                                                              In this section, we will discuss some important properties of materials. The way an object
                                                              responds to an application of a force also depends on its material properties. Engineers, when
                                                              designing products and structural members, need to know how a selected material behaves
                                                              under applied forces or how well the material conducts thermal energy or electricity. Here we
                                                              will look at ways of quantifying (measuring) the response of solid materials to pulling or push-
                                                              ing forces or twisting torques. We will also investigate the behavior of ﬂuids in response to

                                                              material will return to its original size and shape without any permanent deformation. The

                                                              stretches, the normal stress (the normal force divided by the cross-sectional area) is plotted ver-

             286             Chapter 10               Force and Force-Related Parameters

                                                                    Based on their mechanical behavior, solid materials are commonly classiﬁed as either
                                                              ductile or brittle. A ductile material, when subjected to a tensile load, will go through signiﬁcant
                                                              permanent deformation before it breaks. Steel and aluminum are good examples of ductile
                                                              materials. On the other hand, a brittle material shows little or no permanent deformation
                                                              before it ruptures. Glass and concrete are examples of brittle materials.
                                                                    The tensile and compressive strength are other important properties of materials. To pre-
                                                              dict failure, engineers perform stress calculations that are compared to the tensile and com-
                                                              pressive strength of materials. The tensile strength of a piece of material is determined by
                                                              measuring the maximum tensile load a material specimen in a shape of a rectangular bar or
                                                              cylinder can carry without failure. The tensile strength or ultimate strength of a material is
                                                              expressed as the maximum tensile force per unit of the original cross-sectional area of the spec-
                                                              imen. As we mentioned earlier, when a material specimen is tested for its strength, the applied
                                                              tensile load is increased slowly so that one can determine the modulus of elasticity and the elas-
                                                              tic region. In the very beginning of the test, the material will deform elastically, meaning that
                                                              if the load is removed, the material will return to its original size and shape without any per-
                                                              manent deformation. The point to which the material exhibits this elastic behavior is the elas-
                                                              tic point. The elastic strength represents the maximum load that the material can carry without
                                                              any permanent deformation. In many engineering design applications, the elastic strength or
                                                              yield strength (the yield value is very close to the elastic strength value) is used as the tensile
                                                              strength.
                                                                    Some materials are stronger in compression than they are in tension; concrete is a good
                                                              example. The compression strength of a piece of material is determined by measuring the
                                                              maximum compressive load a material specimen in a shape of a cube or cylinder can carry with-
                                                              out failure. The ultimate compressive strength of a material is expressed as the maximum com-
                                                              pressive force per unit of the cross-sectional area of the specimen. Concrete has a compressive
                                                              strength in the range of 10 to 70 MPa. The strength of some selected materials is given in

                                                      port a load of 4000 N distributed uniformly over the cross-sectional area of the member. What

                                                           Material selection for structural members depends on a number of factors, including the
                                                      density of the material, its strength, its toughness, its reaction to the surrounding environment,
                10 cm                                 and its appearance. In this example, we will only consider the strength of the material as the
                                                 5 mm design factor. The average normal stress in the member is given by

                                                              of time. Understanding linear impulse and impulsive forces is important in the design of prod-

                                                              But you recall from Newton’s third law that for every action there is a reaction equal in magni-
                                                              tude and opposite in direction. Therefore, the average force exerted by the ground on the stunt-

                                                              Now that you have reached this point in the text

                                                              • You should understand what is meant by pressure. For static ﬂuids, you should understand

                                                                You should understand what the ﬂuid properties such as viscosity and bulk modulus of com-

                                                              • You should realize that engineers, when designing products, need to know how a selected

                                                              • You should understand that when a force is applied to an object, it can affect the object’s

             308             Chapter 11               Temperature and Temperature-Related Parameters

                                                              example, as you already know, water molecules are made of two atoms of hydrogen and one
                                                              atom of oxygen. Temperature represents the level of molecular activity of a substance. The mol-

                                                              a simple way to visualize this is to imagine the molecules of a gas as being the popcorn in a pop-
                                                              corn popper; the molecules that are at a higher temperature move, rotate, and bounce around
                                                              faster than the colder ones in the popper. Therefore, temperature quantiﬁes or provides a mea-
                                                              sure of how active these molecules are on a microscopic level. For example, air molecules are
                                                              more active at, say, 50C than they are at 25C. You may want to think of temperature this
                                                              way: We have bundled all the microscopic molecular movement into a single, macroscopic,
                                                              measurable value that we call temperature.



                                        11.2                  Measurement of Temperature and Its Units

                                                              Early humans relied on the sense of touch or vision to measure how cold or how warm some-
                                                              thing was. In fact, we still rely on touch today. When you are planning to take a bath, you ﬁrst
                                                              turn the hot and cold water on and let the bathtub ﬁll with water. Before you enter the tub, how-
                                                              ever, you ﬁrst touch the water to feel how warm it is. Basically, you are using your sense of
                                                              touch to get an indication of the temperature. Of course, using touch alone, you can’t quantify
                                                              the temperature of water accurately. You cannot say, for example, that the water is at 21.5C.
                                                              So note the need for a more precise way of quantifying what the temperature of something is.
                                                              Moreover, when we express the temperature of water, we need to use a number that is

                                                                        blacksmiths used to use their eyes to estimate how hot a ﬁre was. They judged the temperature

                                                                              From these examples, you see that our senses are useful in judging how cold or how hot

                                                                        Thus, we need a measuring device that can provide information about the temperature of some-

                                                              There are three different mechanisms by which energy is transferred from a high-temperature
                                                              region to a low-temperature region. These are referred to as the modes of heat transfer. The
                                                              three modes of heat transfer are conduction, convection, and radiation.



                                                              Conduction
                                                              Conduction refers to that mode of heat transfer that occurs when a temperature difference (gra-
                                                              dient) exists in a medium. The energy is transported within the medium from the region with
                                                              more-energetic molecules to the region with less-energetic molecules. Of course, it is the inter-
                                                              action of the molecules with their neighbors that makes the transfer of energy possible. To bet-
                                                              ter demonstrate the idea of molecular interactions, consider the following example of
                                                              conduction heat transfer. All of you have experienced what happens when you heat up some
                                                              soup in an aluminum container on a stove. Why do the handles or the lid of the soup container
                                                              get hot, even though the handles and the lid are not in direct contact with the heating element?
                                                              Well, let us examine what is happening.

                                                                        humidity of 40 to 50%. Of course, if you are exercising on a treadmill and watching TV, then

                   Example 11.15                              An aluminum circular disk with a diameter, d, of 15 cm and a thickness of 4 mm is exposed to
                                                              a heat source that puts out 200 J every second. The density of the aluminum is 2700 kg/m3.
                                                              Assuming no heat loss to the surrounding, estimate the temperature rise of the disk after 15 s.
                                                                   We will make use of Equation (11.28) and Table 11.11 to solve this problem, but ﬁrst we

                   Example 11.16                              We have exposed 1 kg of water, 1 kg of brick, and 1 kg of concrete, each to a heat source that
                                                              puts out 100 J every second. Assuming that all of the supplied energy goes to each material and

                                                                      We can answer this question using Equation (11.28) and Table 11.11. We will ﬁrst look up
                                                              the values of the speciﬁc heat for water, brick, and concrete, which are c water  4180 J/kg  K,

                   ngineers understand the

            E      importance of electricity
                   and electrical power and
             the role they play in our
             everyday lives. As future
             engineers you should know
             what is meant by voltage,
             electric current, and know the
             difference between direct and
             alternating current.       You
             should also know the various
             sources of electricity and
             understand how electricity is
             generated.

                                                              As explained in Chapter 6, it was not until 1946 that the proposal for ampere as a base unit for
                                                              electric current was approved by the General Conference on Weights and Mea-

                                                                    To better understand what the ampere represents, we need to take a closer look at the
                                                              behavior of material at the subatomic level. In Chapter 9 we explained what is meant by atoms
                                                              and molecules. An atom has three major subatomic particles, namely, electrons, protons, and
                                                              neutrons. Neutrons and protons form the nucleus of an atom. How a material conducts elec-
                                                              tricity is inﬂuenced by the number and the arrangement of electrons. Electrons have negative
                                                              charge, whereas protons have a positive charge, and neutrons have no charge.
                                                                    Simply stated, the basic law of electric charges states that unlike charges attract each other
                                                              while like charges repel. In SI units, the unit of charge is the coulomb (C). One coulomb is

                                                              attractive if the charges have opposite signs, and it is repulsive if the charges have the same sign.
                                                              The electric force between two point charges is given by Coulomb’s law:

                                                              An example of a typical residential power distribution system is shown in Figure 12.7,
                                                              which gives examples of amperage requirements for outlets, lights, kitchen appliances, and

                                                              An electrical circuit refers to the combination of various electrical components that are
                                                              connected together. Examples of electrical components include wires (conductors), switches,
                                                              outlets, resistors, and capacitors. First, let us take a closer look at electrical wires. In a wire the
                                                              resistance to electrical current depends on the material from which the wire is made and its
                                                              length, diameter, and temperature. Materials show varying amount of resistance to the ﬂow of
                                                              electric current. Resistivity is a measure of resistance of a piece of material to electric current.

                                                              Note from Ohm’s law, Equation (12.3), that current is directly proportional to voltage and
                                                              inversely proportional to resistance. As electric potential is increased, so is the current; and if

                                                              units of ohms (Æ). An element with 1 ohm resistance allows a current ﬂow of 1 amp when
                                                              there exists a potential of 1 volt across the element. Stated another way, when there exists an

                                                              electric current will ﬂow through the conductor.

                                                              this section we will only look at resistors and capacitors.
                                                                   A resistor is an electrical component that resists the ﬂow of either direct or alternating cur-
                                                              rent. Resistors are commonly used to protect sensitive components or to control the ﬂow of cur-

                                                              are two broad groups of resistors: ﬁxed-value resistors and variable resistors. As the name implies,
                                                              the ﬁxed-value resistor has a ﬁxed value. On the other hand, the variable resistors, sometimes

                                                              and service requirements. Most of these are self-explanatory. We discussed speed and torque in

                                                              motor (in rpm), the power requirement, and the type of load. Some applications deal with

                                                              fan. For this reason, there are many different types of motors. Here we will not discuss the prin-

                                                                        Therefore, make sure you spend a little time to familiarize yourself with the terminology, so you

                                                                             Let us begin by defining illumination. Illumination refers to distribution of light on a hor-

                                                                        light is distributed over an area. A common unit of illumination intensity is called footcandle
                                                                        and is equal to one lumen distributed over an area of 1-square-foot. To give you an idea of what

                                                                        to do detailed work such as fixing electronic equipment or a spring-driven watch, you would

                                                                             Efficacy is another term used by lighting engineers. Efficacy is the ratio of how much light

                                                              current runs through the lead wires and heats up the filament (a tiny coil of tungsten wire), which
                                                              in turn makes the tungsten to glow or produces light. The light produced in this manner is a yel-

                                                              yellow–red colors are considered warm, whereas the blue–green colors are considered cool. For

                                                              considered warm. Warm light sources are preferred for general indoor tasks. Be careful, with the
                                                              counter-intuitive way the warm and cool light sources are defined (high temperatures are cool,
                                                              whereas low temperatures are warm!). How true the colors of an object appear when illuminated
                                                              by a light source is more important than color temperature of light source. For this reason, a vari-
                                                              able called color rendition index (CRI) is defined. The CRI provides a measure of how well a light
                                                              source renders true colors of an object as compared with direct sunlight. The color rendition index
                                                              has a scale of 1 to 100 with a 100-W incandescent light bulb having a CRI value of approximately
                                                              100. For most indoor applications, light sources with CRI of 80 or higher are preferred.
                                                                   There are different types of incandescent light bulbs. The standard incandescent light is
                                                              referred to as a screw-in-A-type. There are also Tungsten halogen and type R incandescent light
                                                              bulbs. The Tungsten halogen lamps have higher efficiencies than A-types, because they have
                                                              inner coatings that reflect heat, consequently require less energy to keep the filament hot at a
                                                              certain temperature. The type R incandescent lights also spread and direct light over a specific

                                                              This is a good place to say a few words about lighting energy audit. As we said at the beginning
                                                              of this section, lighting systems account for a major portion of electricity use in buildings, and
                                                              have received much attention recently due to the energy and sustainability concerns. A light-

                                                              an office, warehouse, manufacturing plant, and so on. Next, an energy auditor determines the
                                                              space characteristics (length, width, height), the light fixtures (lamp types, their number, and
                                                              lamp wattage), and their controls. The auditor then talks to the users about the lighting level,
                                                              their tasks, occupancy profile, and using a light meter measures the light level in the space.
                                                              Then, the comparison between the measurements and the Illuminating Engineering Society
                                                              (IES) recommendation values for a given task is made. The auditor also calculates power con-

                                                              Finally, the energy auditor prepares a report discussing his findings including estimate of annual
                                                              lighting energy cost and ways by which the energy consumption due to lighting system may be

             to build shelter, to cultivate and
             process food, to make goods,
             and to maintain our living places
             at comfortable settings. To
             quantify the requirements to
             move objects, to lift objects, or
             to heat or cool something,
             energy is defined and classified
             into different categories. Power
             is the time rate of doing work.
             The value of power required to
             perform a task represents how
             fast you want the task done.
             If you want a task done in a
             shorter period of time, then
             more power is required.

                                                              There is a sign convention associated with Equation (13.8) that must be followed carefully. Heat

                                                              whereas the heat transfer out of the system, or the work done on the system, is a negative quan-
                                                              tity. The reason for this type of sign convention is to show that work done on the system increases
                                                              the total energy of the system, while work done by the system decreases the total energy of the
                                                              system. Also note that using this sign convention, heat transfer into the system increases the
                                                              total energy of the system, while heat transfer out of the system decreases its total energy.
                                                                    You may also think of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics in the following manner: When it
                                                              comes to energy, the best you can do is to break even. You cannot get more energy out of a sys-

                                                              can get 100 J out of the system in the form of change in internal, kinetic, or potential energy

                                                              From Equation (13.9), the deﬁnition of power, it should be clear that the value of power required
                                                              to perform a task represents how fast you want the task done. If you want a task done in a
                                                              shorter time, then more power is required. For the sake of demonstrating this point better,
                                                              imagine that in order to perform a task 3600 J are required. The next question then becomes,
                                                              how fast do we want this task done? If we want the task done in 1 second, 3600 J/s power is
                                                              required; if we want the task done in 1 minute, then 60 J/s power is needed; and if we want the
                                                              task done in 1 hour, then the required power is 1 J/s. From this simple example, you should
                                                              see clearly that to perform the same task in a shorter period of time, more power is required.
                                                              More power means more energy expenditure per second. Another example that you have a
                                                              direct experience with is the following situation: Which requires more power, to walk up a
                                                              ﬂight of stairs or to run up the stairs? Of course, as you already know, it requires more power
                                                              to run up the stairs, because as compared to walking, when running up the stairs, you perform
                                                              the same amount of work in a shorter time period. Many engineering managers understand the
                                                              concept of power well, for they understand the beneﬁt of teamwork. In order to ﬁnish a proj-
                                                              ect in a shorter period of time, instead of assigning a task to an individual, the task is divided
                                                              among several team members. More useful energy expenditure per day is expected from a team
                                                              than from a single person, thus the project or the task can be done in less time.

                                                              The reason for using the units of Wh for energy input to the compressor is that compres-

                                                              through the inside of a heat exchanger where thermal energy is transported to cold indoor air

                                                              Solar Systems
                                                              Using various technologies, solar radiation can be converted into useful forms of energy, such

                                                              depends on the amount of solar radiation available at a location. In many countries, radiation

                                                              day (kW/m2/day). In the U.S., some of the radiation data is given in British thermal units per
                                                              square foot per day (Btu/ft2/day). The radiation data for solar-electric (photovoltaic) systems are
                                                              represented as kilowatt-hours per square meter (kWh/m2).
                                                                   There are two basic types of active solar heating systems, liquid and air. The liquid
                                                              systems make use of water or water-antifreeze mixture (in cold climates) to collect solar
                                                              energy. In such systems, the liquid is heated in a solar collector (Figure 13.22), and then
                                                              transported via a pump to a storage system. In contrast, in air systems, the air is heated in
                                                              “air collectors” and is transported to storage or space using blowers. Most solar systems
                                                              cannot provide adequate space or hot-water heating. Consequently, an auxiliary or back-up
                                                              heating system is needed. The main components of an active liquid hot water solar system
                                                              are shown in Figure 13.23. A photograph of a home in Golden, Colorado using a liquid solar
                                                              system is shown in Figure 13.24.
                                                                   In moderate climates, solar hot water systems are also used to heat swimming pools. The
                                                              goal of this type of system is to extend the swimming season. Swimming pool solar heaters
                                                              operate at slightly warmer temperatures than the surrounding air temperature. These types of
                                                              systems typically use inexpensive, unglazed collectors made from plastic materials. Because these

                                                              The passive solar systems do not make use of any mechanical components such as collectors, pumps,
                                                              blowers, or fans to collect, transport or distribute solar heat to various parts of a building. Instead,
                                                              a direct passive solar system uses large glass areas on the south wall of a building and a thermal mass
                                                              to collect the solar energy. The solar energy is stored in interior thick masonry walls and floors dur-
                                                              ing the day and is released at night. In cold climates, the passive systems also use insulated curtains
                                                              at night to cover the glass areas to reduce the heat loss. Another feature of a passive solar system is
                                                              an overhang to shade the windows during summer as shown in Figure 13.26. Indirect gain passive
                                                              designs utilize a storage mass placed between the glass wall and the heated space (Figure 13.27). As
                                                              the air between the glass and masonry wall is heated it rises and enters the room through a vent at
                                                              the top of the wall. The room air enters the lower vent and is heated as it rises between the window
                                                              and the masonry wall. Not all of the solar heat is transferred to the air; some is stored.
                                                                    Another common type of solar system is a sunspace. The space may be used as a green-

                                                              Ethanol is an alcohol based fuel that is made from the sugars found in corn and barley.
                                                              Other sources such as rice, sugar cane, and potato skins are also used to produce ethanol.
                                                              Most of the ethanol used in the U.S. today is distilled from corn. You have seen E10 signs

                                                              is a fuel that is commonly made from vegetable oils or recycled restaurant grease, and can

                        In Part Three of this book, we will introduce Microsoft Excel and MATLAB, two computational tools
                        that are used commonly by engineers to solve engineering problems. These computational tools are
                        used to record, organize, analyze data using formulas, and present the results of an analysis in chart
                        forms. MATLAB is also versatile enough that you can use it to write your own program to solve
                        complex problems.

             A        sheet is a tool that can
                      be used to solve an
             engineering problem. Spread
             sheets are commonly used to
             record, organize, and analyze
             data using formulas. Spread
             sheets are also used to present
             the results of an analysis in
             chart form. Although engineers
             still write computer programs
             to solve complex engineering
             problems, simpler problems
             can be solved with the help of a
             spreadsheet.                                                         Source: Saeed Moaveni

                                                              we want to insert three new cells in the location E8 through E11 (E8:E11) and shift the existing
                                                              content of E8:E11 down. We ﬁrst select cells E8:E11; then from the Insert menu we choose the
                                                              Cells option, and then choose the Shift cell down option. To insert a column, click on the column
                                                              indicator button to the right of where you would like to have the new column inserted. From the
                                                              Insert menu, choose Columns. The procedure is similar for inserting a new row among already
                                                              existing rows. For example, if you would like to insert a new column between columns D and E,
                                                              you must ﬁrst select column E, and then from the Insert menu choose Columns; the new column
                                                              will be inserted to the left of column E. To insert more than one column or row simultaneously,
                                                              you should select as many column indicator buttons as necessary to the right of where you would
                                                              like to have the columns inserted. For example, if you would like to insert three new columns
                                                              between columns D and E, then you must ﬁrst select columns E, F, G; then from the Insert menu
                                                              choose Columns, and three new columns will be inserted to the left of column E.

                                                              and Mixed Cell Reference
                                                              When creating formulas you have to be careful how you refer to the address of a cell, especially
                                                              if you are planning to use the Fill command to copy the pattern of formulas, in the other cells.
                                                              There are three ways that you can refer to a cell address in a formula: absolute, relative, and
                                                              mixed reference.
                                                                   To better understand the differences among the absolute, relative, and mixed reference,
                                                              consider the examples shown in Figure 14.4. As the name implies, absolute reference is
                                                              absolute, meaning it does not change when the Fill command is used to copy the formula into
                                                              other cells. Absolute reference to a cell is made by $column-letter$row-number. For example,
                                                              $A$3 will always refer to the content of cell A3, regardless of how the formula is copied. In
                                                              the example shown, cell A3 contains the value 1000, and if we were to input the formula
                                                              0.06* $A$3 in cell B3, the result would be 60. Now if we were to use the Fill command and
                                                              copy the formula down in cells B4 through B11, this would result in a value of 60 appearing
                                                              in cells B4 through B11, as shown in Figure 14.4(a).
                                                                   On the other hand, if we were to make a relative reference to A3, that would change
                                                              the formula when the Fill command is used to copy the formula into other cells. To make a

                                                                        relative reference to a cell, a special character, such as $, is not needed. You simply refer to
                                                                        the cell address. For example, if we were to input the formula 0.06*A3 in cell B3, the result
                                                                        would be 60; and if we use the Fill command to copy the formula into cell B4, the A3 in the
                                                                        formula will automatically be substituted by A4, resulting in a value 75. Note that the for-
                                                                        mula in cell B4 now becomes 0.06*A4. The result of applying the Fill command to cells
                                                                        B4 through B11 is shown in Figure 14.4(b).
                                                                             The mixed cell reference could be done in one of two ways: (1) You can keep the column
                                                                        as absolute (unchanged) and have a relative row, or (2) you can keep the row as absolute and
                                                                        have a relative column. For example, if you were to use $A3 in a formula, it would mean that
                                                                        column A remains absolute and unchanged, but row 3 is a reference row and changes as the for-
                                                                        mula is copied into other cells. On the other hand, A$3 means row 3 remains absolute while
                                                                        column A changes as the formula is copied into other cells. The use of mixed cell reference is
                                                                        demonstrated in the following example.

                                                                        amount column and the interest row, as shown in Figure 14.5. Next we will type into cell B3
                                                                        the formula $A3*B$2. We can now use the Fill command to copy the formula in other

                                                              The Now and Today Functions
                                                              When you work on an important Excel document, it is a good idea to indicate when the doc-
                                                              ument was last modiﬁed. In one of the top cells, you may want to type “Last Modiﬁed:”, and
                                                              in the adjacent cell, you can use the ⴝnow( ) or ⴝtoday( ) function. Then, each time you
                                                              access the Excel document, the now( ) function will automatically update the date and the time
                                                              the ﬁle was last used. So, when you print the sheet, it will show the date and the time. If you
                                                              use the today( ) function, it will only update the date.

                                                              Therefore, next we will explain in detail how to create an xy chart.

                                                                        There are those that are identiﬁable by either a single value or the magnitude. For example,
                                                                        time can be described by a single value such as two hours. These types of physical variables,
                                                                        which are identiﬁable by a single value, are called scalars. Temperature is another example of a

                                                                        example, if you were to describe the location (with respect to the entrance of a garage) of a car
                                                                        parked in a multi-story garage, you need to specify the ﬂoor (the z coordinate) and then the loca-

                                                                        variables, or mathematical terms. The numbers or the variables that make up the matrix are
                                                                        called the elements of a matrix. The size of a matrix is deﬁned by its number of rows and col-

                                                              a three by one matrix with its elements representing variables x, y, and z. The [N ] is called a
                                                              square matrix. A square matrix has the same number of rows and columns. The element of a
                                                              matrix is denoted by its location. For example, the element in the ﬁrst row and the third col-

                                                              matrix. A column matrix is deﬁned as a matrix that has one column but could have many rows.
                                                              On the other hand, a row matrix is a matrix that has one row but could have many columns.

                                                              Curve ﬁtting deals with ﬁnding an equation that best ﬁts a set of data. There are a number
                                                              of techniques that you can use to determine these functions. You will learn about them in
                                                              your numerical methods and other future engineering classes. The purpose of this section is
                                                              to demonstrate how to use Excel to ﬁnd an equation that best ﬁts a set of data which you
                                                              have plotted. We will demonstrate the curve-ﬁtting capabilities of Excel using the following examples.




                   Example 14.10                              In Chapter 10, we discussed linear springs. We will revisit Example 10.1 to show how you can use
                                                              Excel to obtain an equation that best ﬁts a set of force–deﬂection data for a linear spring. For a given
                                                              spring, in order to determine the value of the spring constant, we attached dead weights to one end

                                 ATLAB® is a mathe-

                      M          matical software that
                                 can be used to solve a
                        wide range of engineering
                        problems. Before the intro-
                        duction of MATLAB, engineers
                        wrote their own computer
                        programs to solve engineering
                        problems.      Even     though
                        engineers still write computer
                        codes to solve complex
                        problems, they take advantage
                        of built-in functions of the
                        software. MATLAB is also
                        versatile enough that you can
                        use it to write your own
                        programs.

                                                              In this chapter, we will discuss the use of MATLAB in solving engineering problems.
                                                              MATLAB is a mathematical software available in most of the university
                                                              computational labs today. MATLAB is a very powerful tool, especially for manipu-

                                                              good textbooks that discuss the capabilities of MATLAB to solve a full range of prob-
                                                              lems. Here, our intent is to introduce only some basic ideas so that you can perform some
                                                              essential operations. As you continue your engineering education in other classes, you
                                                              will learn more about how to use MATLAB effectively to solve a wide range of engi-
                                                              neering problems. As we discussed in Chapter 14, before the introduction of electronic
                                                              spreadsheets and mathematical software such as MATLAB, engineers wrote their own
                                                              computer programs to solve engineering problems. Even though engineers still write
                                                              computer codes to solve complex problems, they take advantage of built-in functions of
                                                              softwares that are readily available with computational tools, such as MATLAB.
                                                              MATLAB is also versatile enough that you can use it to write your own programs.
                                                                 This chapter begins by discussing the basic make-up of MATLAB. We will
                                                              explain how to input data or a formula in MATLAB and how to carry out some
                                                              typical engineering computations. We will also explain the use of MATLAB’s math-
                                                              ematical, statistical, and logical functions. Plotting the results of an engineering
                                                              analysis using MATLAB is also presented in this chapter. Finally, we will discuss
                                                              brieﬂy the curve ﬁtting and symbolic capabilities of MATLAB. Symbolic mathe-
                                                              matics refers to the use of symbols rather than numbers to set up problems. Moreover,
                                                              we will use examples from Chapter 14 (Excel) to emphasize that MATLAB is just
                                                              another tool that you can use to solve a variety of engineering problems.


                                        15.1                  MATLAB–Basic Ideas

                                                              We begin by explaining some basic ideas; then once you have a good understanding of these
                                                              concepts, we will use MATLAB to solve some engineering problems. As is the case with any new
                                                              software you explore, MATLAB has its own syntax and terminology. A typical MATLAB win-
                                                              dow is shown in Figure 15.1. The main components of the MATLAB window in the default
                                                              mode are marked by arrows and numbered, as shown in Figure 15.1.
                                                              1. Menu bar: Contains the commands you can use to perform certain tasks, for example, to
                                                                 save your workspace or to change the View settings.
                                                              2. Current Folder: Shows the active directory, but you can also use it to change the directory.
                                                              3. Current Folder Window: Shows all files, their types, sizes, and descriptions in Current Directory.
                                                              4. Move, Minimize, Resize, or Close a tool: For example, clicking on the ➚ icon will move the
                                                                 window outside the desktop.
                                                              5. Command Window: This is where you enter variables and issue MATLAB commands.
                                                              6. Command History Window: Shows the time and the date at which commands were issued
                                                                 during the previous MATLAB sessions. It also shows the history of commands in the current
                                                                 (active) session.

                                                                        example, if you deﬁne x = 2/3, then MATLAB will display x = 0.6667. By default,

                                                              Also note that the %g is the number format character and is replaced by x value, 10. It is also
                                                              important to mention that MATLAB will not produce an output until it encounters the \n.
                                                                  Additional capabilities of disp and fprintf commands will be demonstrated using

                                                              You can save the workspace to a ﬁle by issuing the command: save your_filename. The

                                                              ﬁle from the disk to memory by issuing the command: load your_filename. Over time
                                                              you may create many ﬁles; then you can use the dir command to list the content of the direc-

                                                              LAB commands. However, when you write a program that is longer than a few lines, you use an

                                                              When creating, analyzing, or plotting data, it is often convenient to create a range of numbers.
                                                              To create a range of data or a row matrix, you only need to specify the starting number, the in-

                                                              When writing a computer program, often it becomes necessary to execute a line or a block of your

                                                              For example, suppose we have a set of scores for an exam: 85, 92, 50, 77, 80, 59, 65, 97, 72,
                                                              40. We are interested in writing a code that shows that scores below 60 indicate failing. The
                                                              MATLAB code for this example then could have the following form:

                                                              if the expression following the if statement is not true. For example, suppose we are interested
                                                              in showing not only the scores that indicate failing but also the scores that show passing. We
                                                              can then modify our code in the following manner:
                                                                   scores = [85 92 50 77 80 59 65 97 72 40];

                                                              As explained previously, for simple operations you can use MATLAB’s Command Window to
                                                              enter variables and issue commands. However, when you write a program that is more than a
                                                              few lines long, you use an M-ﬁle. It is called an M-ﬁle because of its .m extension. You can cre-
                                                              ate an M-ﬁle using any text editor or using MATLAB’s Editor/Debugger. To create an M-ﬁle,
                                                              open the M-ﬁle Editor by going to File S New S Blank M-File, and MATLAB opens a new
                                                              window in which you can type your program. As you type your program, you will notice that
                                                              MATLAB assigns line numbers in the left column of the window. The line numbers are quite
                                                              useful for debugging your program. To save the ﬁle, simply click File S Save As . . . and type
                                                              in the ﬁle-name. The name of your ﬁle must begin with a letter and may include other char-
                                                              acters such as underscore and digits. Be careful not to name your ﬁle the same as a MATLAB
                                                              command. To see if a ﬁle-name is used by a MATLAB command, type exist (‘ﬁle-name’) in
                                                              the MATLAB’s Command Window. To run your program, click on Debug S Save File and
                                                              Run (or use the function key F5). Don’t be discouraged to ﬁnd mistakes in your program the

                   Example 15. 3                              It has been said that when Pascal was 7 years old, he came up with the formula                to
                                                                                                                                                      2
                                                              determine the sum of 1, 2, 3, . . . , through n. The story suggests that one day he was asked by
                                                              his teacher to add up numbers 1 through 100, and Pascal came up with the answer in few
                                                              minutes. It is believed that Pascal solved the problem in the following manner:
                                                              First, on one line he wrote the numbers 1 through 100, similar to
                                                                       1      2     3     4 . . . . . . . . . . . 99         100
                                                              Then, on the second line he wrote the numbers backward
                                                                       100        99      98       97 . . . . . . . . . . . 2        1
                                                              Then, he added up the numbers in the two lines, resulting in one hundred identical values
                                                              of 101
                                                                       101        101       101        101 . . . . . . . . . . . 101            101
                                                              Pascal also realized that the result should be divided by 2 —since he wrote down the numbers
                                                                                                                                            10011012
                                                              1 through 100 twice — leading to the answer:                                                    5050. Later, he generalized his

                                                              approach and came up with the formula                                              .
                                                                                                                                        2

                                                              x–y charts, column charts (or histograms), contour, or surface plots. As we mentioned in Chap-
                                                              ter 14, as an engineering student, and later as a practicing engineer, most of the charts that you
                                                              will create will be x–y type charts. Therefore, we will explain in detail how to create an x–y
                                                              chart.



                   Example 15.4                               Starting with a 10 cm  10 cm sheet of paper, what is the largest volume you can create
                               10 cm                          by cutting out x cm  x cm from each corner of the sheet and then folding up the sides? See
                                    x                         Figure 15.11. Use MATLAB to obtain the solution.
                                          x                        The volume created by cutting out x cm  x cm from each corner of the 10 cm  10 cm
                10 cm                         10      2x
                                                              sheet of paper is given by V  (10  2x)(10  2x)x. Moreover, we know that, for x  0 and
                                                              x  5, the volume will be zero. Therefore, we need to create a range of x values from 0 to 5 using
                                                              some small increments, such as 0.1. We then plot the volume versus x and look for the maxi-

                                                              In this section, we will show how you can use MATLAB’s symbolic solvers to obtain solutions

                   Example 15.8                               Consider the following three linear equations with three unknowns: x, y, and z.

                                                              The basic form of the solve command is solve('eqn1','eqn2',

                        Engineers use technical drawings to convey useful information to others in a standard manner. An
                        engineering drawing provides information, such as the shape of a product, its dimensions, materials
                        from which to fabricate the product, and assembly steps. Some engineering drawings are specific
                        to a particular discipline. For example, civil engineers deal with land or boundary, topographic,
                        construction, and route survey drawings. Electrical and electronic engineers, on the other hand,
                        could deal with printed circuit-board assembly drawings, printed circuit-board drill plans, and wiring
                        diagrams. Engineers also use special symbols and signs to convey their ideas, analyses, and
                        solutions to problems. In Part Four of this book, we will introduce you to the principles and rules of
                        engineering graphical communication and engineering symbols. A good grasp of these principles
                        will enable you to convey and understand information effectively.

            E     such as the cellular
                  phone schematics here,
             are important in conveying
             useful information to other
             engineers or machinists in a
             standard manner that allows
             for visualization of the
             proposed product. Important
             information, such as the
             shape of the product, its size,
             type of material used, and the
             assembly steps required, are
             provided by these drawings.

                                                                        glass box, you would see the outlines shown in Figure 16.1. The outlines are called the ortho-

                                                                        Note the relative locations of the top view, the bottom view, the front view, the back view, the

                                                                              At this point, you may realize that the top view is similar to the bottom view, the front view
                                                                        is similar to the back view, and the right-side view is similar to the left-side view. Therefore, you
                                                                        notice some redundancy in the information provided by these six views (diagrams). Therefore,
                                                                        you conclude that you do not need to draw all six views to describe this object.
                                                                        In fact, the number of views needed to describe an object depends on how complex the shape
                                                                        of an object is. So the question is, then, how many views are needed to completely describe
                                                                        the object. For the object shown in Figure 16.1, three views are sufﬁcient to fully describe the
                                                                        object, because only three principle planes of projection are needed to show the object. For
                                                                        the example shown in Figure 16.1, we may decide to use the top, the front, and the right-side
                                                                        views to describe the object completely. In fact, the top, the front, and the right-side views
                                                                        are the most commonly created views to describe most objects. These views are shown in
                                                                        Figure 16.3.
                                                                              From examining Figure 16.3, we should also note that three different types of lines are used
                                                                        in the orthographic views to describe the object: solid lines, hidden or dashed lines, and center-

                                                              where the center of holes or the center of cylinders are. Pay close attention to the difference in

                                                              lines of symmetry are shown in Figure 16.3.

                                                              depend on how complex the object is. For example, if you want to show a bolt washer or a gas-

                                                              reasons. A machinist must be able to make the part from the detailed drawings without need-
                                                              ing to go back to the engineer or the draftsperson who drew the drawings to ask questions
                                                              regarding the size, or the tolerances, or what type of material the part should be made from.
                                                              There are basically two concepts that you need to keep in mind when specifying dimensions in
                                                              an engineering drawing: size and location. As shown in Figure 16.6, not only do you need to
                                                              specify how wide or how long an object is but you must also specify the location of the center
                                                              of a hole or center of a ﬁllet in the part. Moreover, a drawing is dimensioned with the aid of
                                                              dimension lines, extension lines, centerlines, and leaders.
                                                                    Dimension lines provide information on the size of the object; for example, how wide it
                                                              is and how long it is. You need to show the overall dimensions of the object because the machin-
                                                              ist can then determine the overall size of the stock material from which to make the piece. As
                                                              the name implies, extension lines are those lines that extend from the points to which the
                                                              dimension or location is to be speciﬁed. Extension lines are drawn parallel to each other, and
                                                              the dimension lines are placed between them, as shown in Figure 16.6. The leaders are the
                                                              arrows that point to a circle or a ﬁllet for the purpose of specifying their sizes. Often the draw-
                                                              ings are shown Not To Scale (NTS), and therefore a scaling factor for the drawing must also be
                                                              speciﬁed. In addition to dimensions, all engineering drawings must also contain an informa-
                                                              tion box with the following items: name of the person who prepared the drawing, title of the
                                                              drawing, date, scale, sheet number, and drawing number. This information is normally shown
                                                              on the upper- or lower-right corner of a drawing. An example of an information box is shown
                                                              in Figure 16.7.
                                                                    Let us now say a few words about ﬁllets, which are often overlooked in engineering
                                                              drawings, a shortcoming that could lead to problems. Fillet refers to the rounded edges of
                                                              an object; their sizes, the radius of roundness, must be speciﬁed in all drawings. If the size
                                                              of ﬁllets is not speciﬁed in a drawing, the machinist may not round the edges; consequently,
                                                              the absence of ﬁllets could create problems or failure in parts. As some of you will learn

                                                              stress concentrations near the sharp regions. As you will learn later, a simple way of reduc-

             514            Chapter 16                Engineering Drawings and Symbols

                                                              some of the parts made for a product in one place must be easily assembled with parts made
                                                              elsewhere. When you specify a dimension on a drawing—say, 2.50 centimeter—how close
                                                              does the actual dimension of the machined part need to be to the speciﬁed 2.50 cm for the part
                                                              to ﬁt properly with other parts in the product? Would everything ﬁt correctly if the actual
                                                              dimension of the machine part were 2.49 cm or 2.51 cm? If so, then you must specify a toler-

                                                              with its own rules and symbols, and as we mentioned earlier, the American National Standard

                                                              engineering drawings. Here, we have brieﬂy introduced these ideas; you must consult the stan-

                                                              The dashed lines could make the drawing difﬁcult to read and thus difﬁcult for the reader to
                                                              form a visual image of what the inside of the object looks like. An example of an object with a
                                                              complex interior is shown in Figure 16.13. For objects with complex interiors, sectional views
                                                              are used. Sectional views reveal the inside of the object. A sectional view is created by making
                                                              an imaginary cut through the object, in a certain direction, to reveal its interior. The sectional

                                                                   Let us now look at the procedure that you need to follow to create a sectional view. The

                                                              sight. The direction of the sight is marked using directional arrows, as shown in Figure 16.14.

                                                                          using one view. An example of a half-section view is shown in Figure 16.15.

                                        16.8                  Why Do We Need Engineering Symbols?

                                                              The symbols in Figure 16.31 are a “language” used by engineers to convey their ideas, their
                                                              solutions to problems, or analyses of certain situations. As engineering students you will learn
                                                              about the graphical ways by which engineers communicate among themselves. In this section,
                                                              we will discuss the need for conventional engineering symbols as a means to convey informa-
                                                              tion and to effectively communicate to other engineers. We will begin by explaining why there
                                                              exists a need for engineering signs and symbols. We will then discuss some common symbols
                                                              used in civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering.
                                                                   Almost all of you have a driver’s license by now; perhaps you even own a car. If this is the
                                                              case, then you are already familiar with conventional trafﬁc signs that provide valuable infor-
                                                              mation to drivers. Examples of trafﬁc signs are shown in Figure 16.32. These signs are designed
                                                              and developed, based on some acceptable national and international standards, to convey infor-
                                                              mation not only effectively but also quickly. For example, a stop sign, which has an octagon
                                                              shape with a red background, tells you to bring your car to a complete stop.
                                                                   A sign that signals a possibly icy road ahead is another example that warns you to slow
                                                              down because the road conditions may be such that you may end up in a hazardous situation.
                                                              That same information could have been conveyed to you in other ways. In place of the sign

                                                              galleys and lavatories can be positioned anywhere within these zones, which are preengineered
                                                              to accommodate wiring, plumbing, and attachment ﬁxtures. Passenger service units overhead

                                                              For improved, more efﬁcient, in-ﬂight service, the 777 is equipped with an advanced cabin

                                                              with a total of 12 wheels for better weight distribution on runways and taxi areas and avoids the
                                                              need for a supplemental two-wheel gear under the center of the fuselage. Another advantage is
                                                              that the six-wheel trucks allow for a more economical brake design. The 777 landing gear is the
                                                              largest ever incorporated into a commercial airplane.

                        As an engineer, whether you are designing a machine part, a toy, a frame of a car, or a structure,
                        the selection of materials is an important design decision. In this part of the book, we will look
                        more closely at materials such as metals and their alloys, plastics, glass, wood, composites, and
                        concrete that commonly are used in various engineering applications. We will also discuss some
                        of the basic characteristics of the materials that are considered in design.

             metals, such as alloyed
             aluminum, are used in many
             structural and aerospace
             applications because of their
             small densities (relative to
             steel) and high strength-to-

             554             Chapter 17               Engineering Materials

                                                                   It is important to note here that we have only posed a few generic questions; we could
                                                              have asked additional questions had we considered the speciﬁcs of the application. For example,
                                                              when selecting materials for implants in bioengineering applications, one must consider many
                                                              additional factors, including: Is the material toxic to the body? Can the material be sterilized?
                                                              When the material comes into contact with body ﬂuid, will it corrode or deteriorate? Because
                                                              the human body is a dynamic system, we should also ask: How would the material react to
                                                              mechanical shock and fatigue? Are the mechanical properties of the implant material compat-
                                                              ible with those of bone to ensure appropriate stress distributions at contact surfaces? These are
                                                              examples of additional speciﬁc questions that one could ask to ﬁnd suitable material for a speciﬁc
                                                              application.
                                                                   By now it should be clear that material properties and material cost are important
                                                              design factors. However, in order to better understand material properties, we must ﬁrst
                                                              understand the phases of a substance. We discussed the phases of matter in Chapter 9; as a
                                                              review and for the sake of continuity and convenience, we will brieﬂy present the phases of
                                                              matter again here.


                                                              The Phases of Matter: Solids, Liquids, Gases, and Plasma
                                                              As we discussed in Chapter 9, when you look around, you will ﬁnd that matter exists in various
                                                              forms and shapes. You will also notice that matter can change shape when its condition or its sur-
                                                              roundings are changed. We also explained that all solid objects, liquids, gases, and living things
                                                              are made of matter, and matter itself is made up of atoms or chemical elements. There are 106
                                                              known chemical elements to date. Atoms of similar characteristics are grouped together and
                                                              shown in a table—the periodic table of chemical elements. Atoms are made up of even smaller
                                                              particles we call electrons, protons, and neutrons. In your ﬁrst chemistry class, you will study these
                                                              ideas in more detail, if you have not yet done so. Some of you may decide to study chemical
                                                              engineering, in which case you will spend a great deal of time studying chemistry. But for now,
                                                              remember that atoms are the basic building blocks of all matter. Atoms are combined naturally,
                                                              or in a laboratory setting, to create molecules. For example, as you already know, water molecules
                                                              are made of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen. A glass of water is made of billions
                                                              and billions of homogeneous water molecules. A molecule is the smallest portion of a given mat-
                                                              ter that still possesses its microscopic characteristic properties.
                                                                   Matter can exist in four states, depending on its own and the surrounding conditions:
                                                              solid, liquid, gaseous, or plasma. Let us consider the water that we drink every day. As you
                                                              already know, under certain conditions, water exists in a solid form that we call ice. At a stan-
                                                              dard atmospheric pressure, water exists in a solid form as long its temperature is kept under 0⬚C.
                                                              Under standard atmospheric pressure, if you were to heat the ice and consequently change its
                                                              temperature, the ice would melt and change into a liquid form. Under standard pressure at sea
                                                              level, the water remains liquid up to a temperature of 100⬚C as you continue heating the water.
                                                              If you were to carry out this experiment further by adding more heat to the liquid water,
                                                              eventually the liquid water changes its phase from liquid into a gas. This phase of water we
                                                              commonly refer to as steam. If you had the means to heat the water to even higher temperatures,
                                                              temperatures exceeding 2000⬚C, you would ﬁnd that you can break up the water molecules
                                                              into their atoms, and eventually the atoms break up into free electrons and nuclei that we call
                                                              plasma.

                                                                        For example, as you know from your everyday experience, the density of ice is different from
                                                                        liquid water (ice cubes ﬂoat in liquid water), and the density of liquid water is different from
                                                                        that of steam. Moreover, the properties of a material in a single phase could depend on its tem-
                                                                        perature and the surrounding pressure. For example, if you were to look up the density of liq-
                                                                        uid water in the temperature range of, say, 4⬚ to 100⬚C, under standard atmospheric pressure,
                                                                        you would ﬁnd that its density decreases with increasing temperature in that range. Therefore,
                                                                        properties of materials depend not only on their phase but also on their temperature and pres-

                                                                        electronic applications, for example, the electrical resistivity of materials is important. How
                                                                        much resistance to the ﬂow of electricity does the material offer? In many mechanical, civil, and

                                                              Density Density is deﬁned as mass per unit volume; it is a measure of how compact the mate-
                                                              rial is for a given volume. For example, the average density of aluminum alloys is 2700 kg/m3
                                                              and compared to steel density of 7850 kg/m3, aluminum has a density that is approximately one-
                                                              third the density of steel.

                                                              Modulus of Elasticity (Young’s Modulus) Modulus of elasticity is a measure of how easily a mate-
                                                              rial will stretch when pulled (subject to a tensile force) or how well the material will shorten
                                                              when pushed (subject to a compressive force). The larger the value of the modulus of elasticity
                                                              is, the larger the required force would be to stretch or shorten the material. For example, the
                                                              modulus of elasticity of aluminum alloy is in the range of 70 to 79 GPa, whereas steel has a mod-
                                                              ulus of elasticity in the range of 190 to 210 GPa; therefore, steel is approximately 3 times stiffer
                                                              than aluminum alloys.

                                                              Modulus of Rigidity (Shear Modulus) Modulus of rigidity is a measure of how easily a material
                                                              can be twisted or sheared. The value of modulus of rigidity, also called shear modulus, shows the
                                                              resistance of a given material to shear deformation. Engineers consider the value of shear mod-
                                                              ulus when selecting materials for shafts and rods that are subjected to twisting torques. For
                                                              example, the modulus of rigidity or shear modulus for aluminum alloys is in the range of 26 to
                                                              36 GPa, whereas the shear modulus for steel is in the range of 75 to 80 GPa. Therefore, steel
                                                              is approximately three times more rigid in shear than aluminum.

                                                              Tensile Strength The tensile strength of a piece of material is determined by measuring the
                                                              maximum tensile load a material specimen in the shape of a rectangular bar or cylinder can
                                                              carry without failure. The tensile strength or ultimate strength of a material is expressed as the
                                                              maximum tensile force per unit cross-sectional area of the specimen. When a material specimen
                                                              is tested for its strength, the applied tensile load is increased slowly. In the very beginning of the
                                                              test, the material will deform elastically, meaning that if the load is removed, the material will
                                                              return to its original size and shape without any permanent deformation. The point to which
                                                              the material exhibits this elastic behavior is called yield point. The yield strength represents the
                                                              maximum load that the material can carry without any permanent deformation. In certain engi-
                                                              neering design applications (especially involving brittle materials), the yield strength is used as
                                                              the tensile strength.

                                                              Compression Strength Some materials are stronger in compression than they are in tension;
                                                              concrete is a good example. The compression strength of a piece of material is determined by
                                                              measuring the maximum compressive load a material specimen in the shape of cylinder or cube
                                                              can carry without failure. The ultimate compressive strength of a material is expressed as the
                                                              maximum compressive force per unit cross-sectional area of the specimen. Concrete has a com-

                                                              how effective the material is in absorbing mechanical energy without sustaining any perma-

                                                              Titanium alloys show excellent resistance to corrosion. Titanium is quite expensive compared to
                                                              aluminum and it is heavier than aluminum, having a density which is roughly one-half that of steel.
                                                              Because of their relatively high strength-to-weight ratios, titanium alloys are used in both com-

                                                              titanium alloys have been used in the tubing in desalination plants as well. Replacement hips and

                                                                   With its silvery white appearance, magnesium is another lightweight metal that looks like
                                                              aluminum, but it is lighter, having a density of approximately 1700 kg/m3. Pure magnesium
                                                              does not provide good strength for structural applications and because of this fact, it is alloyed

                                                              in aerospace applications and some automobile parts as sacriﬁcial anodes to protect other

                                                       Alloy steels, because of mechanical properties such as superior strength, are used in a wide range of
                                                       applications—from structural components to machine parts.



                                                              18% chromium and 8% nickel, are commonly used for tableware and kitchenware products.

                                                              most iron alloys containing less than 2% carbon are ductile.


                                                              Concrete
                                                              Today, concrete is commonly used in construction of roads, bridges, buildings, tunnels, and
                                                              dams. What is normally called concrete consists of three main ingredients: aggregate, cement,
                                                              and water. Aggregate refers to materials such as gravel and sand, and cement refers to the bond-
                                                              ing material that holds the aggregate together. The types and size (ﬁne to coarse) of aggregate
                                                              used in making concrete varies depending on the application. The amount of water used in
                                                              making concrete (water-to-cement ratio) could also inﬂuence its strength. Of course, the mix-
                                                              ture must have enough water so that the concrete can be poured and have a consistent cement
                                                              paste that completely wraps around all aggregates. The ratio of amount of cement to aggregate
                                                              used in making concrete also affects the strength and durability of concrete. Another factor
                                                              that could inﬂuence the cured strength of concrete is the temperature of its surroundings when
                                                              it is poured. Calcium chloride is added to cement when the concrete is poured in cold climates.

                  Examples of concrete used in construction.

                                                                        the low temperature of the surroundings. You may have also noticed as you walk by newly

                                                                              Concrete is a brittle material that can support compressive loads much better than it does

                                                                        that consists of thin metal rods to increase its load-bearing capacity, especially in the sections

                                                                        where they are erected. This practice saves time and money. As we mentioned, concrete has a

                                                              the steel rods or wires are stretched; after the concrete has been poured and after enough time
                                                              has elapsed, the tension in the rods or wires is released. This process, in turn, compresses the
                                                              concrete. The prestressed concrete then acts as a compressed spring, which will become uncom-

                                                              Wood
                                                              Throughout history, wood, because of its abundance in many parts of the world, has been a
                                                              material of choice for many applications. Wood is a renewable source, and because of its ease
                                                              of workability and its strength, it has been used to make many products. Wood also has been
                                                              used as fuel in stoves and ﬁreplaces. Today, wood is used in a variety of products ranging from
                                                              telephone poles to toothpicks. Common examples of wood products include hardwood
                                                              ﬂooring, roof trusses, furniture frames, wall supports, doors, decorative items, window frames,
                                                              trimming in luxury cars, tongue depressors, clothespins, baseball bats, bowling pins, ﬁshing
                                                              rods, and wine barrels (see Figure 17.1). Wood is also the main ingredient that is used to make
                                                              various paper products. Whereas a steel structural member is susceptible to rust, wood, on the
                                                              other hand, is prone to ﬁre, termites, and rotting. Wood is anisotropic material, meaning that
                                                              its properties are direction-dependent. For example, as you may already know, under axial
                                                              loading (when pulled), wood is stronger in a direction parallel to a grain than it is in a direc-
                                                              tion across the grain. However, wood is stronger in a direction normal to the grain when it is
                                                              bent. The properties of wood also depend on its moisture content; the lower the moisture con-
                                                              tent, the stronger the wood is. Density of wood is generally a good indication of its strength.
                                                              As a rule of thumb, the higher the density of wood, the higher its strength. Moreover, any
                                                              defects, such as knots, would affect the load-carrying capacity of wood. Of course, the location
                                                              of the knot and the extent of the defect will directly affect its strength.
                                                                   Timber is commonly classiﬁed as softwood and hardwood. Softwood timber is made from
                                                              trees that have cones (coniferous), such as pine, spruce, and Douglas ﬁr. On the other hand,
                                                              hardwood timber is made from trees that have broad leaves or have ﬂowers. Examples of hard-

                                                                        many applications. They are very lightweight, strong, inexpensive, and easily made into vari-

                                                                             Polymers are the backbone of what we call plastics. They are chemical compounds that
                                                                        have very large, molecular, chainlike structures. Plastics are often classiﬁed into two categories:
                                                                        thermoplastics and thermosets. When heated to certain temperatures, the thermoplastics can be
                                                                        molded and remolded. For example, when you recycle Styrofoam dishes, they can be heated and
                                                                        reshaped into cups or bowls or other shapes. By contrast, thermosets can not be remolded into
                                                                        other shapes by heating. The application of heat to thermosets does not soften the material for

                                                              made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE). However, note that in a broader sense poly-

                                                              titanium oxide and zinc oxide are used to give a plastic sheet its white color. Carbon is used to
                                                              give plastic sheets their black color, as is the case in black trash bags. Depending on the appli-

                                                              rigidity, ﬂexibility, enhanced strength, or a longer life span that excludes any change in the

                                                              is being performed every day to make plastics stronger and more durable and to control the

                                                              Silicon is a nonmetallic chemical element that is used quite extensively in the manufacturing of
                                                              transistors and various electronic and computer chips. Pure silicon is not found in nature; it is
                                                              found in the form of silicon dioxide in sands and rocks, or found combined with other elements
                                                              such as aluminum, calcium, sodium, or magnesium in the form that is commonly referred to as
                                                              silicates. Silicon, because of its atomic structure, is an excellent semiconductor, a material whose
                                                              electrical conductivity properties can be changed to act either as a conductor of electricity or as

                                                              elements such as iron and copper to give steel and brass certain desired characteristics.

             572             Chapter 17               Engineering Materials

                                                                    There are other gases present in the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide,
                                                              and nitrogen oxide. The atmosphere also contains water vapor. The concentration level of these
                                                              gases depends on the altitude and geographical location. At higher altitudes (10 to 50 km), the
                                                              earth’s atmosphere also contains ozone. Even though these gases make up a small percentage of
                                                              earth’s atmosphere, they play a signiﬁcant role in maintaining a thermally comfortable envi-

                                                              role in sustaining plant life; however, if the atmosphere contains too much carbon dioxide, it
                                                              will not allow the earth to cool down effectively by radiation. Water vapor in the atmosphere

                                                              and snow.

                                                              Humidity There are two common ways of expressing the amount of water vapor in air:
                                                              absolute humidity or humidity ratio, and relative humidity. The absolute humidity is deﬁned
                                                              as the ratio of mass of water vapor in a unit mass of dry air, according to
                                                                                                         mass of water vapor 1kg2
                                                                     absolute humidity ⫽
                                                                                                             mass of dry air 1kg 2
                                                                                                                                                                                                               (17.1)

                                                              For humans, the level of a comfortable environment is better expressed by relative humidity,
                                                              which is deﬁned as the ratio of the amount of water vapor or moisture in the air to the maxi-
                                                              mum amount of moisture that the air can hold at a given temperature. Therefore, relative
                                                              humidity is deﬁned as
                                                                                                                      the amount of moisture in the air 1kg 2

                                                              Most people feel comfortable when the relative humidity is around 30 to 50%. The higher the
                                                              temperature of air, the more water vapor the air can hold before it is fully saturated. Because of
                                                              its abundance, air is commonly used in food processing, especially in food drying processes to
                                                              make dried fruits, spaghetti, cereals, and soup mixes. Hot air is transported over the food to
                                                              absorb water vapors and thus remove them from the source.
                                                                    Understanding how air behaves at given pressures and temperatures is also important when
                                                              designing cars to overcome air resistance or designing buildings to withstand wind loading.

                                                              You already know that every living thing needs water to sustain life. In addition to drinking

                                                              the ocean. On land, depending on the amount of precipitation, part of the water inﬁltrates the
                                                              soil, part of it may be absorbed by vegetation, and part runs as streams or rivers and collects into
                                                              natural reservoirs called lakes. Surface water refers to water in reservoirs, lakes, rivers, and
                                                              streams. Groundwater, on the other hand, refers to the water that has inﬁltrated the ground;

                                                              You think you’ve got problems? How would you like to be a molecule of air minding your own

                                                                   Over the course of the next 40 thousandths of a second you, Mr. or Ms. Molecule, will be
                                                              beaten through 18 stages of compression, singed in a furnace heated to nearly 3,000 degrees

                                                              of getting Aunt Marge to Phoenix for a much needed rest.
                                                                   That’s basically what happens every day in the skies above as thousands of Pratt engines
                                                              power aircraft from place to place while the passengers and crew inside those aircraft experience

                                                                        Fan
                                                                        The propulsion process begins with the huge, 9-foot-diameter fan at the front of the engine,
                                                                        spinning 2,800 times a minute at takeoff speed. That fan sucks in air at the rate of 2,600 pounds
                                                                        per second, or enough to vacuum out the air from a 4-bedroom house in less than half a second.


                                                                        Compression
                                                                        As the air leaves the fan it is now separated into two streams. The smaller stream, about 15
                                                                        percent of the total volume of air, is called primary or core air and enters the ﬁrst of two com-

                                                                        through each stage of the two compressors, both its temperature and pressure rise.


                                                                        Combustion
                                                                        When compression is complete, the air, now 30 times higher in pressure and 1,100 degrees
                                                                        hotter, is forced through a furnace or combustor. In the combustion chamber, fuel is added and
                                                                        burnt. The air’s temperature soars even higher, and the air is ﬁnally ready to do the two jobs
                                                                        for which it has been so hastily prepared.


                                                                        Turbine

                                                                        wind spinning the arms of a windmill. The whirling turbines turn the shafts that drive both

                                                              The larger air stream exiting the fan, representing 85 percent of the total, is called fan air or
                                                              bypass air, because it bypasses this entire process.
                                                                  The engine itself is shrouded in a metal casing called the nacelle, shaped roughly like a
                                                              sideways ice cream cone with the bottom cut off. Bypass air is forced through the ever narrower
                                                              space between the nacelle wall and the engine, picking up speed along the way.
                                                                  Because of its huge volume, bypass air needs only to accelerate a small amount to produce
                                                              an enormous kick of thrust. In the PW4084 engine, bypass air accounts for 90 percent of the
                                                              thrust, and has the added beneﬁts of keeping the engine cooler, quieter and more fuel efﬁcient.

                        Engineering problems are mathematical models of physical situations with different forms that rely
                        on a wide range of mathematical concepts. Therefore, good understanding of mathematical
                        concepts is essential in the formulation and solution of many engineering problems. Moreover,
                        statistical models are becoming common tools in the hands of practicing engineers to solve quality
                        control and reliability issues, and to perform failure analyses. Civil engineers use statistical models
                        to study the reliability of construction materials and structures, and to design for flood control.
                        Electrical engineers use statistical models for signal processing and for developing voice-
                        recognition software. Manufacturing engineers use statistics for quality control assurance of the
                        products they produce. Mechanical engineers use statistics to study the failure of materials and
                        machine parts. Economic factors also play important roles in engineering-design decision making. If
                        you design a product that is too expensive to manufacture, then it cannot be sold at a price that
                        consumers can afford and still be profitable to your company. In the last part of this book, we will
                        introduce you to important mathematical, statistical, and economical concepts.

                                                                        Mathematical models of engineering problems may have many different forms.
                                                                        Some engineering problems lead to linear models, whereas others result in nonlin-

                                                                        A good understanding of matrix algebra is essential in the formulation and solution

                                                              growth rate of an exponential function increases. Example 2 demonstrates similar changes for a

                                                              A good understanding of these concepts will be beneﬁcial when you take future engineering classes.

                                                              of numbers, variables, or mathematical terms. The numbers or the variables that make up the matrix
                                                              are called the elements of matrix. The size of a matrix is deﬁned by its number of rows and columns.
                                                              A matrix may consist of m rows and n columns. For example,

                                                              As you will see in the classes which you will take later, the formulation and solution of engi-

                                                              a matrix into the columns of another matrix.
                                                                   In general, to obtain the transpose of a matrix [B ] of size m  n, the ﬁrst row of the given
                                                              matrix becomes the ﬁrst column of [B]T, the second row of [B ] becomes the second column
                                                              of [B ]T, and so on, leading to the m th row of [B ] becoming the m th column of [B ]T, and
                                                              resulting in a matrix with the size of n  m. The matrix [B]T reads as a transpose of the [B]
                                                              matrix.

                                                              ces, as row matrices using the transpose of the solution—another use for the transpose of a
                                                              matrix. For example, we represent the solution given by the U matrix.

                                                              As we discussed earlier, the formulation of many engineering problems leads to a system of

                                        18.6                  Calculus

                                                              Calculus commonly is divided into two broad areas: differential and integral calculus. In the
                                                              following sections, we will explain some key concepts related to differential and integral calculus.

                                                              Differential Calculus
                                                              A good understanding of differential calculus is necessary to determine the rate of change in
                                                              engineering problems. The rate of change refers to how a dependent variable changes with
                                                              respect to an independent variable. Let’s imagine that on a nice day, you decided to go for a ride.
                                                              You get into your car and turn the engine on, and you start on your way for a nice drive. Once
                                                              you are cruising at a constant speed and enjoying the scenery, your engineering curiosity kicks
                                                              in and you ask yourself, how has the speed of my car been changing? In other words, you are
                                                              interested in knowing the time rate of change of speed, or the tangential acceleration of the car.
                                                                   As deﬁned above, the rate of change shows how one variable changes with respect to
                                                              another variable. In this example, speed is the dependent variable and time is the independent
                                                              variable. The speed is called the dependent variable, because the speed of the car is a function of
                                                              time. On the other hand, the time variable is not dependent on the speed, and hence, it is
                                                              called an independent variable. If you could deﬁne a function that closely described the speed
                                                              in terms of time, then you would differentiate the function to obtain the acceleration. Related
                                                              to the example above, there are many other questions that you could have asked:
                                                              What is the time rate of fuel consumption (gallons per hour)?
                                                              What is the distance rate of fuel consumption (miles per gallon)?
                                                              What is the time rate of change of your position with respect to a known location (i.e., speed
                                                                 of the car)?
                                                              Engineers calculate the rate of change of variables to design products and services. The engineers
                                                              who designed your car had to have a good grasp of the concept of rate of change in order to build
                                                              a car with a predictable behavior. For example, manufacturers of cars make certain information
                                                              available, such as miles per gallon for city or highway driving conditions. Additional familiar
                                                              examples dealing with rates of change of variables include:
                                                              How does the temperature of the oven change with time, after it is turned on?
                                                              How does the temperature of a soft drink change over time after it is placed in a refrigerator?
                                                              Again, the engineers who designed the oven and refrigerator understood the rate of change con-

                                                              rate of change of variables are sought.

             626             Chapter 18               Mathematics in Engineering

                                                              aries of the beam. For Example 1, at supports located at X  0 and X  L, the deﬂection of the
                                                              beam Y is zero. Later, when you take your differential equation class, you will learn how to obtain
                                                              the solution for this problem, as given in Table 18.8. The solution shows, for a given load W, how
                                                              the given beam deﬂects at any location X. Note that, if you substitute X  0 or X  L in the solu-
                                                              tion, the value of Y is zero. As expected, the solution satisﬁes the boundary conditions.
                                                                    The differential equation for Example 2 is derived by applying Newton’s second law to the
                                                              given mass. Moreover, for this problem, the initial conditions tell us that, at time t  0, we
                                                              pulled the mass upward by a distance of y 0 and then release it without giving the mass any ini-
                                                              tial velocity. The solution to Example 2 gives the position of the mass, as denoted by the vari-
                                                              able y, with respect to time t. It shows the mass will oscillate according to the given cosinusoidal
                                                              function.
                                                                    In Example 3, T represents the temperature of the ﬁn at the location denoted by the
                                                              position X, which varies from zero to L. Note that X is measured from the base of the ﬁn. The
                                                              boundary conditions for this problem tell us that the temperature of the ﬁn at its base is T base,
                                                              and the temperature of the tip of the ﬁn will equal the air temperature, provided that the ﬁn is
                                                              very long. The solution then shows how the temperature of the ﬁn varies along the length of
                                                              the fin.

             634             Chapter 19               Probability and Statistics in Engineering

                                                              Statistical models are being used increasingly more often by practicing engineers to
                                                              address quality control and reliability issues, and to perform failure analyses. Civil
                                                              engineers use statistical models to study the reliability of construction materials
                                                              and structures, and to design for ﬂood control and water supply management. Elec-

                                                              recognition software. Mechanical engineers use statistics to study the failure of
                                                              materials and machine parts, and to design experiments. Manufacturing engineers
                                                              use statistics for quality control assurance of the products they produce. These are
                                                              but a few examples of why an understanding of statistical concepts and models is
                                                              important in engineering. We will begin by explaining some of the basic ideas in
                                                              probability and statistics. We will then discuss frequency distributions, measure of
                                                              central tendency (mean and median), measure of variation within a data set (stan-

                                        19.1                  Probability–Basic Ideas

                                                              If you were to ask your instructor how many students are enrolled in your engineering class this
                                                              semester, she could give you an exact number: say 60. On the other hand, if you were to ask her
                                                              how many students will be in the class next year, or the year after, she would not be able to give
                                                              you an exact number. She might have an estimate based on trends or other pieces of informa-
                                                              tion, but she cannot know exactly how many students will be enrolled in the class next year.
                                                              The number of students in the class next year, or the year after, is random. There are many sit-
                                                              uations in engineering that deal with random phenomena. For example, as a civil engineer, you
                                                              may design a bridge or a highway. It is impossible for you to predict exactly how many cars will
                                                              use the highway or go over the bridge on a certain day. As a mechanical engineer, you may design
                                                              a heating, cooling, and ventilating system to maintain the indoor temperature of a building at a
                                                              comfortable level. Again, it is impossible to predict exactly how much heating will be required
                                                              on a future day in January. As a computer engineer, you may design a network for which you can-
                                                              not predict its future usage exactly. For these types of situations, the best we can do is to predict
                                                              outcomes using probability models.
                                                                   Probability has its own terminology; therefore, it is a good idea to spend a little time

                                                                        sions about the characteristics of something with a large number of data points— commonly
                                                                        called a population —using a smaller portion of the entire data. For example, using statistics, we

                                                                        demonstrates, it is neither feasible nor practical to contact two million people to ﬁnd out how

                                                                             Statistical models are becoming common tools in the hands of practicing engineers to

                                                              how well they are made. As they perform experiments, they collect data that can be used to
                                                              explain certain things better and to reveal information about the quality of products and services
                                                              they provide. In the previous section, we deﬁned what we mean by population and samples. In
                                                              general, any statistical analysis starts with identifying the population and the sample. Once we
                                                              have deﬁned a sample that represents the population and have collected information about the
                                                              sample, then we need to organize the data in a certain way such that pertinent information and
                                                              conclusions can be extracted. To shed light on this process, consider the following example.

                                                              received scores that were in the range of 70 –79, which is considered an average performance.
                                                              These average scores also constitute the largest frequency in the given data set. Another useful
                                                              piece of information, which is clear from examining Table 19.1, is that the frequency (the num-
                                                              ber of scores in a given range) increases from 3 to 5 to 9 and then decreases from 6 to 3. Another
                                                              way of showing the range of scores and their frequency is by using a bar graph (what is com-
                                                              monly called a histogram). The height of the bars shows the frequency of the data within the
                                                              given ranges. The histogram for Example 19.2 is shown in Figure 19.1.

                                                              In this section, we will discuss some simple ways to examine the central tendency and variations
                                                              within a given data set. Every engineer should have some understanding of the basic funda-
                                                              mentals of statistics and probability for analyzing experimental data and experimental errors.
                                                              There are always inaccuracies associated with all experimental observations. If several variables
                                                              are measured to compute a ﬁnal result, then we need to know how the inaccuracies associated
                                                              with these intermediate measurements will inﬂuence the accuracy of the ﬁnal result. There are
                                                              basically two types of observation errors: systematic errors and random errors. Suppose you
                                                              were to measure the boiling temperature of pure water at sea level and standard pressure with
                                                              a thermometer that reads 104⬚C. If readings from this thermometer are used in an experiment,
                                                              it will result in systematic errors. Therefore, systematic errors, sometimes called ﬁxed errors,
                                                              are errors associated with using an inaccurate instrument. These errors can be detected and
                                                              avoided by properly calibrating instruments. On the other hand, random errors are generated
                                                              by a number of unpredictable variations in a given measurement situation. Mechanical vibra-

                                                              in experimental observations. These are examples of random errors.
                                                                   Suppose two groups of students in an engineering class measured the density of water at
                                                              20⬚C. Each group consisted of ten students. They reported the results shown in Table 19.3. We

                                                              Based on data provided, we have calculated the probabilities corresponding to the time

                                                              bilities is equal to 1. Also note that if we were to connect the midpoints of time results
                                                              (as shown in Figure 19.5), we would have a curve that approximates a bell shape. As the
                                                              number of data points increases and the intervals decrease, the probability-distribution curve
                                                              becomes smoother. A probability distribution that has a bell-shaped curve is called a normal
                                                              distribution. The probability distribution for many engineering experiments is approximated
                                                              by a normal distribution.

                                                                        Interest is the extra money—in addition to the borrowed amount—that one must pay for the

                                                              interest earned on money deposited in a bank is computed using compound interest. The con-
                                                              cept of compound interest is discussed next.


                                                              Compound Interest
                                                              Under the compounding interest scheme, the interest paid on the initial principal will also
                                                              collect interest. To better understand how the compound interest earned or paid on a principal
                                                              works, consider the following example. Imagine that you put $100.00 in a bank that pays you
                                                              6% interest compounding annually. At the end of the ﬁrst year (or the beginning of the second
                                                              year) you will have $106.00 in your bank account. You have earned interest in the amount of
                                                              $6.00 during the ﬁrst year. However, the interest earned during the second year is determined
                                                              by ($106.00)(0.06)  $6.36. That is because the $6.00 interest of the ﬁrst year also collects 6%
                                                              interest, which is 36 cents itself. Thus, the total interest earned during the second year is $6.36,
                                                              and the total amount available in your account at the end of the second year is $112.36. Com-

                                                              in a similar fashion will lead to $141.83 in your account at the end of the sixth year. Refer to
                                                              Table 20.1 for detailed calculations. Note the difference between $100.00 invested at 6% sim-
                                                              ple interest and 6% interest compounding annually for a duration of six years. For the simple
                                                              interest case, the total interest earned, after six years, is $36.00, whereas the total interest accu-

                             Example 20.9                               In this example problem, we show how to deal with situations when the frequency of uniform

                                        20.9                  Choosing the Best Alternatives–Decision Making

                                                              Up to this point, we have been discussing general relationships that deal with money, time, and
                                                              interest rates. Let us now consider the application of these relationships in an engineering set-
                                                              ting. Imagine that you are assigned the task of choosing which air-conditioning unit to purchase
                                                              for your company. After an exhaustive search, you have narrowed your selection to two alter-
                                                              natives, both of which have an anticipated 10 years of working life. Assuming an 8% interest
                                                              rate, ﬁnd the best alternative. Additional information is given in Table 20.10. The cash-ﬂow dia-
                                                              grams for each alternative are shown in Figure 20.6.
                                                                    Here we will discuss three different methods that you can use to choose the best econom-
                                                              ical alternative from many options. The three methods are commonly referred to as (1) pres-
                                                              ent worth (PW) or present cost analysis, (2) annual worth (AW) or annual cost analysis, and
                                                              (3) future worth (FW) or future cost analysis. When these methods are applied to a problem,
                                                              they all lead to the same conclusion. So in practice, you need only apply one of these methods
                                                              to evaluate options; however, in order to show you the details of these procedures, we will apply
                                                              all of these methods to the preceding problem.
                                                              Present Worth or Present Cost Analysis With this approach you compute the total present
                                                              worth or the present cost of each alternative and then pick the alternative with the lowest present

                                                              Bonds
                                                              States, counties, and cities issue bonds to raise money to pay for various projects, such as schools,
                                                              highways, convention centers, and stadiums. Corporations also issue bonds to raise money to
                                                              expand or to modernize their facilities. There are many different types of bonds, but basically,
                                                              they are loans that investors make to government or corporations in return for some gain. When
                                                              a bond is issued, it will have a maturity date (a year or less to 30 years or longer), par value (the
                                                              amount originally paid for the bond and the amount that will be repaid at maturity date), and
                                                              an interest rate (percentage of par value that is paid to bond holder at regular intervals).


                                                              Depreciation
                                                              Assets (such as machines, cars, and computers) lose their value over a period of time. For
                                                              example, a computer purchased today by a company for $2000 is not worth as much in three
                                                              or four years. Companies use this reduction in value of an asset against their before-tax income.
                                                              There are rules and guidelines that specify what can be depreciated, by how much, and over
                                                              what period of time. Examples of depreciation methods include the Straight Line and the

                                                              In engineering, the term life-cycle cost refers to the sum of all the costs that are associated
                                                              with a structure, a service, or a product during its life span. For example, if you are designing
