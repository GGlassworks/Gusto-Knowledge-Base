   Progressing Negotiations
   From Agreed Terms to Binding Contract
   The Softer Side of Negotiation
Take-Home Messages

   Negotiation is participatory
   Positional negotiation is not effective
   Power in negotiation comes from preparation
   Preparation is necessary prior to any interaction
    with the other party
   Ninety percent of the negotiation process is done
    before the first meeting
   Listening is probably your most important skill to
    develop
The Art of Effective Negotiation

 “in good deal making, 90% of the real
 negotiation happens before you sit down
 to negotiate’”

 “effective negotiation is 90% attitude
 and 10% technique”

    Know yourself
    Know your own organization
    Know the opposite party
Definitions and Guidelines
   Negotiation facilitates agreement when some of
    your interests are shared and some are opposed
   Negotiation is the process of evolving
    communication to get from opposition to
    consensus, manage conflict and reach agreement
   Negotiation principles apply as much to your
    internal team as they do to an outside party
Definitions and Guidelines

   Negotiation and influencing skills are critical to
    getting the best deal, facilitating problem solving,
    gaining support and building co-operative
    relationships
   Negotiation is central to gaining agreement and
    exercising influence
       The ability to influence others and resolve conflict is at the
        core of successful business
Definitions and Guidelines
   Negotiation is an integrated process requiring:
       Effective communication
       Development of consensus (internal & external)
       Process Management
       Influence building and relationship development
   Success in negotiation depends on confidence
       Confidence enables and arises from a) careful advance planning to
        maximize options and b) working creatively during the negotiations to
        optimize the outcome

   Success is ultimately measured by the potential
    contribution of a deal to the bottom line of your portfolio
   Sometimes the best deals are the ones not done!
Preparation: The Elevator Pitch
     Your first assignment as a BD person
     Template:
           We provide (state the nature of your product/service)…
           …for (who is the target audience)…
           … who want (what does this audience need)…
           …and are looking for (what audience values).
           Most people aren’t even aware that (what should they know
            but might not know to ask).
           We always offer (case building, foundation for differentiation)
           To help our audience make the best decisions possible, we
            offer _______________ which contains (evidence)

Negotiation Style
We All Have an Individual Style
   Style is a consistent pattern of behaviors emanating from an
    individual and recognised by others
   Distinct negotiating styles
       Warm
       Tough
       Numbers
       Dealer
   The role of style in negotiation enables us to understand and
    manage
           Ourselves
           Our internal team
           The opposite party
    Character as the Basis of Negotiation Style

   Style is influenced by innate character traits

   Style can be fine-tuned to adapt to different negotiation
    scenarios - your fundamental character does not change

   Complementary styles make a successful negotiating team
       Adapting style can enhance and improve intra-team co-operation
Where Does Our Style Come From?
   Genetics
   Upbringing
   Social background
   Education and training
   National culture
   Reaction and response to other people
   Professional experience

No one fits exactly into one style, but most of us have a 60-
80% fit with one
To recognize your style, you need to look inside and find out
how others see you

Objectives
   Define strategic purpose of partnering
       Cash
       Pipeline gap
       Experience in pre-clinical or clinical development
       Meet commercialization goals

   Define the market opportunity
       Elaborate commercial potential - be realistic, consult experts
       Understand competition, potential differentiators
       Develop financial model and understand sensitivity of key parameters;
        e.g. how changing the numbers changes the proportion of profit share
        between licensor and licensee
       Prepare strategic options as a decision tree and the financial
        implications of partnering at different development time-points
       Prepare a product life cycle plan
Align Objectives to Potential Partners
   Is there one ideal partner for the opportunity?
       Based on e.g. Strategy, capabilities, industry reputation,
        therapeutic focus, deal-making history
       Synergies with your organization obvious
       Candidate for ‘Proactive Review’
       Approach to negotiation can be more targeted and customized to
        the ideal partner in question

   Or are there potentially many contenders?
       e.g. Earlier stage assets requiring initial exploratory research
        phase
       More effort required in initial ‘finder’ phase, to identify partner
        with ideal strategic fit
       Candidate for ‘Reactive Review’
       Approach to negotiation initially more general (one size fits all)
        then customized once probable partner identified
Maintaining Alignment to Internal Corporate
Objectives
   Create a communication plan within your company so the
    message is always the same
   Establish and communicate criteria for identifying
    potential partners and their fit to your organization
   Begin to define and structure the type of deal your
    organization is seeking
       Understand your Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement
        (BATNA)
       Create a rough outline of a term sheet including ballpark figures
        for financial terms and trigger events for payments
       Analyze comparable deals
       Reaffirm your BATNA in the context of your draft term sheet
   Ensure the broad definition of the deal is communicated
    effectively internally
       Secure buy-in as early as possible in the process
Visualize the Opportunity



         BATNA            TARGET    OPENING POSITION




                     Bargaining
  Their Needs          Zone                Your Needs




                 TARGET            BATNA
Planning Tools
   Create a map of the issues – note what a change in one
    issue will do to another
   Set your limits
       What is your BATNA? This will be the low end of your limit
       What is their BATNA? Difficult to estimate, but very important
       What is your target? Your target should be ambitious without
        being ludicrous. It should be near their BATNA
   Set your first offer and ensure this is communicated to
    your key stakeholders internally
       Even if the other party offers the first term sheet, you must keep
        your first offer in mind
Examples of Negotiation Issues

    Planning Tools
   Make a chart of what issues or terms you will give up, what you
    must keep, what you want to get, and what could be a surprise.
   Create a chart of information that you will disclose to the other
    party, keep from the other party, want to get from the other party,
    and what would surprise you if they gave it to you.
   Remember, information is power in a negotiation

                        Give            Get




                        Keep           Surprise
    Preparation for Initial Contact
   Establish the objective for the initial contact
   Have all your planning tools together and completed
       Information needs, possible scenarios, etc.
   Prepare your introduction statement
       Envisaged relationship
       Balance of power
       Possible outcomes and probability of success
   Determine who should be contacted and who should make the contacts.
    Agree on “one voice”
   Make initial contact; assess and establish interest
   Discuss and agree next steps
       Transfer of non-confidential materials: have all relevant publications,
        patents, posters, etc ready in pdf form to send out upon request
       Define and agree time frame for review and follow-up period to enable you
        to meet internal expectations
    Building the Scientific Contact
   Define what your organization requires to build the foundation of a full
    binding agreement with the party
       Transfer of proprietary materials under an MTA?
       More collaborative involvement in a predefined Feasibility Study?
   Secure the necessary co-operation and buy in from your scientific and
    technical specialists
       Ensure your key individuals know their counterparts in the partner
        organization
       Keep technical achievability aligned to strategic intent, even at this early
        stage
   Work with your internal specialists to outline the workplan for this stage
    of the interaction
       Bear in mind that all provisions (e.g. obligations, ownership of inventions,
        confidentiality, consequences of termination) must align with the intended
        terms of the eventual full agreement
    Guiding Principles

   Openly discuss needs and expectations of your
    organization

   Invite other party to describe their needs and expectations

   Establish agreement on scope & Key Success Factors
    which will guide decision-making in the project

   Codify into statement(s) that define the spirit as well as the
    intent of the desired relationship
    Overall Goal of Negotiation: to become the
    Preferred Partner
   Partnership is a social as well as a legal contract
       Anticipate balance between explicit terms and operational flexibility.
        Be pragmatic
   Get beyond the other party’s positions; understand their
    interests and priorities and balance with yours
   Proactively seek solutions which balance needs
   Use objective criteria to support decision-making whenever
    possible
       Individuals move on; minimize need for subjective interpretations
   Keep personalities out of the negotiations
   Remember: Preferred Partner is not necessarily Exclusive
    Partner
       Licensor may be using this deal to rank you against other opportunities
Positive Attributes of the Negotiator
   Good listening skills
   Clear, consistent vision of their goals
   Maintains a long-term vision for the partnership
   Blunt and candid about their wants and needs
   Honest and upfront regarding value and limitations of
    their offering
   Good market awareness
   Trustworthy and professional
   Values integrity: keeps (most) of their promises
   Fair and consistent
   Discrete and considerate
   Good sense of humor

            Research and
            Development
Preparation
   Negotiate a bilateral CDA
     Do this quickly and efficiently

   Have your confidential information package ready
     Products: detail of pre-clinical studies (ADME, tox, in
      vivo) as pdf files
     Products and technology: include protocols

     Customize materials for the party in question, aiming
      to anticipate their questions
First Confidential Interaction

   Create agenda jointly with the other party
   Deliver messages effectively; stipulate timelines, constraints,
    expectations
   Probe how the other party views the opportunity, their needs and
    their priorities. Refer to your information chart… ask the
    questions! Gather as much information as you can now
   Establish open dialog enabling flexible problem solving for
    mutual gain
   Identify areas of agreement and disagreement to the satisfaction
    of both parties
   Identify action points; follow up promptly and definitively
Due Diligence
   Due diligence underpins the entire negotiation process
      Shows willingness of both parties to prepare and be professional
      Cooperation in fielding relevant specialists is essential
      Key issues identified, addressed and resolved early
   Performed through electronic data rooms and site visits
       Compound (materials)
       Scientific / technical
       Intellectual property
   Due diligence = effective communication in action
      Be open and swift to respond
      Do not become defensive
      Learn from the experience
Due Diligence – Electronic Data Rooms
   Convenient for many types of diligence
       Scientific – pre-clinical reports, animal toxicity studies,
        manufacturing information (SOPs, QA), clinical study
        reports
       Intellectual property
       Financial documents
   Organization of information is critical
   Control of access is key
       Access can be staged, printing can be restricted
   Some things still stay out of data rooms
   Complemented by on-site visits
    Due Diligence & Site Visits:
    Managing your Team
   YOU are in charge
   Select and convene your team well in advance
       Agree each person’s assignment
       Agree any “off-limit” topics
       Agree to answer only questions asked by the other party
       Ensure all disclosures can be substantiated
       Assure your team that “I don’t know” is an acceptable response
   Ensure that everyone looks and behaves professionally
   Regroup with your team afterwards to discover what has
    been learned
    Due Diligence & Site Visits:
    Managing the Other Party

   Give your visitors privacy
   Establish and communicate your policy on copies of
    documents being removed from the building
   Clean white-boards, clear meeting room of irelevant
    materials
   Make sure labs are clean and offices are organized
   Provide refreshments; arrange hotels and transportation
   Check on progress, but don‘t hover
   On completion, invite them to dinner with your team
Due Diligence: Science and Materials
   Obtain questions in advance
   Organize all reports and protocols – provide in meeting
    room if possible
   Have all manufacturing information (including information
    or approvals from manufacturer / regulators) to hand
   Ensure that key specialists are available where required
    and are fully briefed
    Due Diligence: Intellectual Property
    Prepare document room (electronic or physical) with all
     relevant files
    Compile applications / patents and their status and
     prosecution history in spread sheet format
    Have invention disclosure system ready
    Assist other party in understanding specific requirements
     for inventor law
    Exclude FTO opinion and other recommendations of
     counsel
    Beyond Due Diligence: Final Term Sheet
    Pressure-test your organization’s interests and priorities as
     negotiations proceed
        Negotiations may have created new opportunities
        Conflicting priorities may drive compromise… yet compromise
         may not always be the best solution
    Define the scientific/technical scope in detail
        Continue to build and manage contact between yours and their
         specialists
        Finalize workplans
        Agree go/no go decision points, especially early in the
         collaboration
        Stay on top of IP created through these interactions
    Due diligence may not be complete before the term sheet is finalized
Communication

Summary of Best Practice
   Plan ahead
       Preparation builds confidence
   First impressions are critical – make yours a good one
   Manage communication channels, internally and with the other
    party
   Commit agreed points and open issues to writing – share
    freely
   Take note of recurring contentious issues
       Keep your introduction statement in mind - but convene with your
        team afterwards to ensure your position is reasonable
   Never postpone resolution of critical issues until legal drafting
   CASE STUDY BREAK HERE
From Agreed Terms to Binding Contract



       A Nuts and Bolts Approach
Setting the Scene
   Establish what your agreed term sheet represents
       Overall opportunity
       Responsibilities
       Value creation opportunities
       Strategic priority for your organization
   Refer back to your term sheet negotiations and any key
    issues identified with the other party
       Don’t forget the agreed timetable to reach closure
   Identify who will be involved in the legal drafting process
    on your side
       Establish contact with equivalents in other party
   Brief your transaction team on all of the above
    Building Strategic Agreements for the Long
    Term
   Most deals fail to realize their full potential due to early
    termination
   Impact of premature termination is far greater than failure to
    deliver downstream milestone and royalty payments
       Opportunity cost
       Disillusionment among collaborating scientists
       Failure to meet board/senior management/investor expectations
       Exacerbation of internal communication challenges
       Damage to external reputation
   Aim to immunize your deal against common partnership
    pitfalls
   Mitigate the risk of exposure to factors beyond your control
    Define the Deal Components
   Work with your internal team to ensure that all phases of
    the deal (research, development, commercialization) have
    been thoroughly thought through
   Construct decision trees for each deal phase (not to be
    shared with the other party) to give you maximum
    negotiation flexibility through each phase
   Identify deal breaker issues within each phase with key
    internal stakeholders and address them objectively and fully
       You will be in a more commanding negotiation position if you are
        aware of your own issues before they are raised as such by the
        other party
    Deal Components - Research


    Research                Development          Commercial


   Research issues include
       Research term, options to extend, research plan, sponsored vs.
        self-funded, where is the hand off
       Roles and responsibilities
       FTE commitment – fixed or not?
       Resource allocation and cost allocation
       Governance
       Intellectual property – who owns or controls?
    Deal Components - Development


    Research                 Development          Commercial


   Development issues include
       Definition of product profile, development plans, resource
        commitment, manufacturing responsibilities for clinical supply,
        regulatory affairs, roles and responsibilities, cost sharing or
        reimbursement procedures
       Selection criteria for development candidate (and back-up?)
       Opt out provisions, rights to initial development compound vs. next
        generation / back-up compounds
    Deal Components - Commercialization


    Research                 Development          Commercial


   Commercial issues include
       Commercialization plan
       Manufacturing responsibilities for commercial supply
       Resources
       Roles and responsibilities
       Cost sharing and reimbursement
       Trade-offs for retained rights
       Royalty vs. profit sharing
    Commencement of Legal Drafting
   As licensor, you and your transaction team should aim to
    produce the first draft
   By going first, you establish an anchor point for the evolving
    discussions and deliberations – representing a good
    psychological advantage
   Ensure that your legal counsel is fully aware of tangible and
    intangible factors pertinent to the deal
       Maintain close contact with counsel at all times
       Any specific issues that need to be carefully drafted – license
        grants, IP control, etc.
       Be aware of any scheduling conflicts arising and communicate
        these to the other party in a timely fashion
   Do not lose touch with your key stakeholders internally
       No need to brief executive management every step of the way – but
        keep your specialists on your side throughout
    Behavior Management: Principles
   Listen
   Question
   Summarize
   Build on common ground
   Build on the other party‘s ideas
   Summarize
   Emphasize agreement
   Describe your feelings
   Summarize


                        Communicate!
    Behavior during Legal Drafting Negotiations
   Explain and back up your position
       Identify points of agreement with the other party – don’t place too
        much emphasis on areas of disagreement at this stage
   Consider the response you will make to their best and worst
    reaction
       “You’ll have to do better than that”. Your response “Exactly how
        much better than that do I have to do?”
   Avoid contradiction
       it creates confrontation and eventually leads to stalemate
   When the other party sets out their position forcefully, do
    not accept or reject it immediately
       Probe for the interests underlying their position and explore how to
        address those interests
   “If we can do that for you, what can you do for us?”
    Behavior during Legal Drafting Negotiations
   Ignore threats and ultimatums
       These may appear to symbolize strength, but they are more often
        symptoms of weakness
       In these situations, use delays or silences to counter their position
   Use “I feel”, “I felt”, “I found” to turn hostility around
   Be aware of body language at all times
       Ensure your own team is attentive and interested
       Make note of sudden responses from the other party (smiles,
        frowns, snorts)
   Maintain an atmosphere of co-operation and willingness to
    be reasonable
    Making Concessions
   Start high, concede slowly, and taper them
   Resist slipping into dividing the pie (distributive bargaining);
    strive for “integrative bargaining” to trade off between
    issues and make the pie bigger
   Be aware of your big and little issues. Make big moves on
    little issues, and little moves on big issues
   Continue to visualize your issues as a map
       Deal with the entire package: no issue is closed until all associated
        issues have been decided
       Seek compromise – “If you agree our requested FTE rate, we could
        consider rescheduling the first milestone”
   Focus on interests, not positions
       Positions you will hear, underlying interests you’ll have dig hard to
        discover
Keep your BATNA in Sight!

            BATNA          TARGET        multidimensional

  Remember: “We most prefer to say yes to the
     requests of someone we know and like”
    Use of Tactics in Negotiations

   Negotiations naturally and inevitably involve tactics
   Make sure you can distinguish a tactic from a “Dirty Trick”
       A dirty trick is a tactic deliberately designed to mislead and/or break
        down the other party, leaving it with no options and/or preserving
        broader self-interests
   Everyone uses dirty tricks to some extent (sometimes even
    subconsciously!)
   You may call the intention of a dirty trick into question but
    focus instead on the behavior
   If used on you (e.g. included in the package), declare your
    disappointment using “I feel”, “I felt”, “I found” statements
Examples of Tactics
   Many tactics can influence negotiation outcome
       Anchoring – influence opinion by dropping a number as a
        reference point
       Nudging – direct choices subconsciously, without
        forbidding any options
       Authority – cite key opinion leaders, experts, boards of
        directors, etc. Can be a form of nudge
       Risk aversion to loss
Anchoring
   Anchoring on the offense
       Set high goals prior to negotiation
       Open with the best deal for you (highest or lowest number)
        to give a framework of reference
   Anchoring on the defense
       Use a de-biasing strategy – think about the opposite
        perspective when a number is given
       Ignore the details of the case at hand; seek market
        comparables
   Experience and information is the key to anchoring…
    how good is yours? How good is theirs?
Nudging
   A nudge in the real world is easy to find… fruit at eye
    level and junk food hidden away, making something an
    active choice to achieve the non-ideal result (subscribing
    to a newsletter as the default).
   Setting up the milestones in a deal that you want so the
    other side only thinks to change the number - not the
    event that causes it
   Keep in mind that small and apparently insignificant
    details can have major impacts on people’s behavior
Authority
   An influence tactic that is used all the time
       Citing or engaging an expert and referencing their
        qualifications
         Though an expert can define what is fair and what isn’t

       Having reams of paper with data from key opinion leaders
       Using the board of directors or the CEO as a smokescreen
        for refusing to compromise or delivering an ultimatum
       Can lead the other side to neglect competitor information
Risk of Loss
   Studies have shown that people are more risk-averse
    when they are contemplating gains
       They will go for the higher chance of a gain
       Or if they are told they have a high chance of losing a
        larger amount of money, they choose the 100% chance of
        losing the smaller amount of money rather than a small
        chance of losing nothing
       They prefer surety for loss
   Result: give good news in chunks and bad news all at
    once
   Frame choices in terms of losses rather than gains
    Dealing with Derailed Negotiations
   Is the delay a one-off hitch in communication? Chronic
    slowness? Indication of a wider issue in the partner
    organization? Maneuvering for an advantage?
   An emerging pattern requires decisive action and an
    escalating response
       If there is clear evidence of a cultural disconnect or pattern of “dirty
        tricks” emanating from the other side, broach the subject with the
        lead negotiator(s), preferably alone and definitely in private
   Determine whether the party is serious about doing a deal
       Does the pattern of behavior in negotiations portend problems in a
        future partnership?
   Resume negotiations with mutually agreed provisos or
    “walk”, depending on the severity of the impasse, your
    response to it and your options
    “Walking Away” Is More Than a Tactic

   The primary objective of a negotiation is not to do a deal –
    it’s to advance one’s business through doing a deal
   Define internally the point at which a deal structure and/or
    partnership becomes a net, long-term loss
   Be clear throughout the negotiation about which terms are
    absolute “must haves” or “deal-breakers”
   If the negotiation fails, examine the extent to which the
    failure resulted from that specific partner
       Or was there a weakness in the technology which needed to be
        overcome? Or were your objectives unrealistic at the outset?
   Sometimes a deal not done is the appropriate outcome
    Gaining Commitment

   When agreement has finally been reached, do not gloat
    over your victories nor brood over your defeats
   Continue to work cooperatively with the other party to build
    trust and manage the relationship
   Remain responsive to the timely identification of problems
    and negotiation of solutions
   Keep sight of the goal: to secure commitment. Signing the
    agreement is just a symbol of that commitment
   Closing: When? How?
When
  All remaining gaps have narrowed
  Their concessions or yours have dried up
  You are at your target or limit
  Implementation questions start taking over
  Body language... Everyone is interested
How
  Summarize and agree (eye contact, firm language)
  One last concession (if we agree to this then we have a deal)
  Make final offer – confer with your team, package it, firm delivery, pack
   up your papers, close your pen, and shut up after you say so
       If they don’t accept it and you still want to continue, break out with
        your team to discuss further options. Or sleep on it!
       If they give it, did they leave a way out? Ignore the finality, break out
        with your team to discuss further options
The Softer Side of Negotiation

        Culture and Communication
    The Global BD Environment
   Business opportunity does not exist in a vacuum
       Organizations that accept and manage cross-cultural aspects
        of business are more likely to succeed
   Opportunity is colored by the unique combination of culture,
    beliefs, values, behavior and approach of the other party
       As it relates to its business
       As it relates to how that business is negotiated
   Accepting and aiming to understand the other party’s
    differences is key to effective negotiation
  Universal Indicators of Influence
  1. Reciprocity – You, then me, then you, then me…
     • Be the first to give (information, concession) during
           negotiation
  2.   Liking – Making friends to influence people
  3.   Consensus – People follow the lead of similar or like-minded
       people
  4.   Consistency - People fulfill written, public, voluntary
       commitments
  5.   Authority – People defer to experts who provide shortcuts to
       decisions
  6.   Scarcity – People value what is scarce

Visualizing Cultural Understanding
                        Observable behavior
                            Can learn overall tendencies, but likely to
                             identify do’s and don’ts
                            May lead to superficial understanding



                        Shared values
                            Requires inferences from observed
                             behavior and learning about a culture
                            More powerful, because values drive
                             (partially) behavior


                        Shared assumptions
                            Highly abstract – drive values, but are
                             hard to determine
                            Very powerful; enable true understanding
                             of a culture
Awareness of Cultural Differences
   Applies equally to sectors, companies, countries, and
    within teams
       Language, values, expectations, philosophies
   Cultural understanding and fit is relevant to the nature of
    the deal being negotiated
       e.g. Arms length license vs. merger
  Impact of Culture on Negotiation

  Goal                 Contract     Relationship
  Agreement Building   Bottom Up    Top Down
  Agreement Form       Specific     General

Team-related
  Team Organization    One Leader   Consensus
  Communications       Direct       Indirect
  Time Sensitivity     High         Low

Non-verbal Communication
   Be conscious of your own body language during negotiations
   Basic observations
       Leaning away or arms crossed – unconvinced, not
        interested
       Hands steepled – confidence
       Hands together with thumbs up – positive thoughts
       Crossed legs with jiggling feet – impatience, discomfort
       Fiddling with objects – doubt, insecurity
   Remember that your emotions show on your face
   Be aware that some body language may simply reflect a lack
    of understanding
Do As the Romans Do?
   Good advice when negotiating across cultural differences

   BUT…
       Not all negotiators adapt effectively
       Other party may be adapting at the same time!
       Negotiation style may vary for internal and external communications

   SO…
       Acknowledge cultural differences, agree to work through them
       Moderate adaptation can be effective
       “Brokers” to manage major cultural / language barriers
     Top Nine for Negotiating Across Cultures
1.   Prepare, prepare, prepare
     Don‘t be derailed by problems arising from things you should have known
2.   Avoid jargon, idioms and slang
3.   A picture is worth a thousand words
     Support your case with instructive visuals
4.   Patience, patience, patience
     Especially where cultures do not see time as money
5.   Retain cultural neutrality
     Do not judge
6.   Think long-term
     Written agreement may be seen as just the start of the relationship
7.   Know thyself
     Recognise where your own preferences may lead to cultural stereotypes / prejudice
8.   Thou shalt not…..
     Comment on the other party’s approach to and ethics of doing business, way of life, laws,
     religion, race, etc.
9.   Be prepared to say No
Remember:




       It all depends on you
