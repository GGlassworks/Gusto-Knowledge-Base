 DEVELOPMENT EXERCISE 1.
 THE SALES MANAGEMENT ROLE
 A look at how you currently approach to your job

 For each aspect of the Sales Management Role, listed below, mark your current performance against
 3 criteria.

 1. Your effective use of time
 2. Your understanding of this aspect of the job
 3. Your need for development

 SCORING SYSTEM

 1. For effective use of time, score marks out of 10, where 10 is fully effective and 0 is totally
    ineffective
 2. For understanding of the job function, score marks out of 10, where 10 is full understanding of
    how to perform the job function and 0 is lack of understanding
 3. For development needs rank each as being either (a) no need for further development, (b) needs
    further development, or (c), needs development as a priority

 INTERPRETING THE RESULTS

 When you have completed the exercise you will be aware of your current use of time, understanding
 of the job and future development needs

 Go to the action plan at the end of the book and write down 2 ways in which you currently approach
 your job, where you need to spend more time, and 2 ways where you need to spend less time. For
 example you might identify you are spending too much time selling and not enough time with
 members of your team.

 Pick out 2 aspects of the job where you need help in carrying out your day-to-day work. Discuss these
 with your manager

 Rank your development needs in order of importance. The majority of these will be covered during
 this programme; however, your company may provide other training opportunities that could help
 with developing your skills.

 The exercise may leave you feeling dissatisfied with where you are currently, in terms of your
 development. Don’t worry. Skills development takes a lifetime. The important thing is that you have
 begun the process of self-development that will, in the long term, make you a more effective
 manager

 MANAGEMENT STYLES
 How management styles change and how to identify your preferred style

 When we use the phrase management style we are normally referring to the ways in which different
 people carry out the role of manager. Given the same job, it is likely that no two managers would
 probably manage the job in exactly the same way. The two central aspects of management behaviour
 that have been identified are task and relationship. Task being the emphasis placed on achieving
 work results and relationship the emphasis placed on the well-being of people in work teams, their
 morale and general development.

 In extremes we can observe ineffective management styles:

 COMPLETELY TASK ORIENTATED

 The work being completed is everything to this manager, irrespective of the feelings or well-being of
 the people in the team. In the short term and in crisis this style can produce results, but longer term,
 focusing on nothing but the task can be counter productive. Team members fail to develop and
 gradually become frustrated and bored. Can you think of a manager you have known who displayed
 these characteristics? What was that person like to work for and how successful was this style of
 management?

 COMPLETELY RELATIONSHIP ORIENTED

 Taken in the extreme, this manager is less concerned with the job getting done, than with morale,
 team spirit and inter-team relationships. In the short term it can be fun to work for this type of
 manager but longer term, people need to feel successful and achievement of the task is a
 prerequisite for success. Have you worked with a manager who has displayed these characteristics?
 What was it like to work with him, or her, and how successful was this style of management?

 There is no right or wrong management style. Different styles will be more or less effective
 depending on:

 • The maturity of the work team
 • The situation

 An immature work team, that is a new team that has recently been brought together, or one that is
 not successful, will tend to respond better initially to a high task \ low relationship kind of style. The
 manager tells the team what to do, when and how to do it and keeps a close eye on the team at
 work.

 As the team matures and gets to understand its role and the various tasks it needs to perform it does
 not need such strong hands-on management and the manager can concentrate more on relationships
 within the team, put less emphasis on overseeing the task and more on developing the skills of
 individual team members.

MTD Sales Training                                          The Sales Manager’s Guidebook – Module 1


 Gradually as the team becomes more ‘mature’ the manager can spend progressively less time
 managing the task and the relationship, and can begin to delegate more and give the team more
 decision making authority, confident in its ability, to a large extent, to manage itself. This is a mature
 work team.

 However, even in mature teams the situation can change. The company, for example, could have a
 severe financial crisis in which case the manager may need to become more task oriented and less
 relationship oriented, making unpopular but necessary decisions.

 The lessons for new managers to learn is that:

      Most managers have a style of management they prefer

      Management styles should change to suit the situation and the maturity of the team.

 DEVELOPMENT EXERCISE 2. MANAGEMENT STYLES
 Read the following case study, and then answer the questions on the following 2 pages

 Graham Jackson has been appointed Regional Sales Manager for Scotland for the Britannia House
 Insurance Group based in Edinburgh. He has a team of 30 people working for him that includes a
 direct salesforce of eight people, a telesales team of five, administrative back-up, an assistant sales
 manager and a secretary.

 He has come into the region at the worst time in its history. There has not been a permanent
 manager on-site for 18 months and the team is lying bottom in the league table for both direct and
 telesales. The quality of administration is woefully inadequate and morale within the team is rock
 bottom.

 He has a very strong authoritarian style and he is convinced that, given the strengths and weaknesses
 of the existing team, he can bring them success. He begins the process by imposing high standards in
 every area of the business including discipline, dress, quality of written work, activity levels etc and
 motivates the team leading from the front. Slowly but surely the teams’ results begin to improve.

 The team begins to regain its self confidence, there is real enthusiasm and the working environment
 becomes much more lively and positive, with Graham very much the hands-on leader involved in
 decisions at all levels.

 Graham continues to monitor every aspect of the team’s performance in detail demanding higher
 standards all the time. The team continues to do well and is very soon out-performing other more
 traditionally successful teams in other parts of the UK. Within 12 months they are lying third from the
 top of the league table in direct sales and second in telesales. They have also won an inter-company
 award for good customer service.

 A few months later Graham is in his office reading through the activity reports for that week when his
 assistant comes to him and says he has the chance to negotiate a contract with a major new
 customer in the area. If it comes off it will be a major coup for the region. Graham says: "Don’t worry.
 Leave it with me and I’ll sort it out".

 An argument develops and his assistant offers his resignation. Graham is taken aback. The assistant
 tells him that morale in the team is back at rock bottom and that others have told him they are
 actively looking for alternative employment. Graham loses his temper and accuses his assistant of
 being disloyal.

 "When I came here" he says "this team was the worst in the country and I have made it one of the
 best. I work long hours for this team and all I get is complaints" His assistant leaves the room and
 Graham goes back to work checking final copies of all the office correspondence for grammatical
 errors and spelling mistakes. "Ungrateful" he says to himself, "that’s what they are, ungrateful".

 DEVELOPMENT EXERCISE 2. MANAGEMENT STYLES
 Here are some answers to Graham's problem.
 Compare them with your own.

 Graham is almost totally task oriented. He is an excellent crisis manager because he is highly skilled at
 setting standards and managing the task. He doesn’t worry if a few people get upset in the process as
 long as targets are beaten and the team is efficiently organised and run

 When he joined the region he was highly effective because he gave members of the team very clear
 objectives and set high personal standards of behaviour. After spending so long without success
 Graham’s approach was a breath of fresh air and morale within the team was restored

 However, as the team achieved more success there was less need for him to check things in such
 detail, although every need to maintain high standards. His inability to delegate effectively meant
 that people became frustrated in their jobs and the quality of their work began to suffer, along with
 deterioration in team morale

 His problem now, is letting go. This does not mean abdicating responsibility, but recognising that the
 skill of a manager lies in achieving results through people. It is possible that he lacks confidence and
 needs to recognise that if the team is going to continue developing he will have to give members of
 the team more responsibility and more of the credit for its success

 There are several steps he could take to move things on. Firstly he could meet with his managers and
 supervisors, as a group, and review progress to date and put together a plan for the future. He could
 carry out appraisals to review the individual performance of team members and begin the process of
 delegation in a structured way. He could also thank the team for their efforts and ask for ideas from
 within the whole team to improve future performance. There are many things he could do, but will
 he?

 His manager would benefit from spending time with Graham, seeing what he is doing on a day to day
 basis, carrying out an appraisal with him, that will help Graham to recognise his strengths and
 weaknesses and hopefully help him realise he has a problem. Graham needs to understand that by
 letting go a little bit he will have more time to look after the development of the team and recognise
 future opportunities to make his team even more successful.

 DEVELOPMENT EXERCISE 3. THE NEW MANAGER
 This case study relates to a new manager taking over a sales team

 Ann Watson has recently been promoted to Sales Manager, with a sales team based in the North East
 of England. She has previously worked in several parts of the country in sales and this is her first Sales
 Management role. She is excited about the challenge of her new job and is anxious to achieve results
 as quickly as possible.

 Her predecessor was Tim Hartley, a longtime employee of the company, who had been in charge of
 the North East team for eight years. Tim Hartley was liked by his team despite being a hard
 taskmaster. He had particular ideas about managing people, which basically meant that if you were
 doing well he left you alone and if you were failing to achieve adequate sales results he would, in his
 own words, "Come down on you like a ton of bricks".

 When Ann was interviewed for the post she was told that three members of the sales team had also
 applied for the manager’s job. One of these people is a close personal friend of Ann’s family and
 there is a strong possibility that Ann’s appointment might affect the relationship.

 Of the two others, one has rung Ann wishing her success and offering any help that Ann may need in
 her new role. Ann has heard on the grapevine that the other unsuccessful candidate for the job is
 making known his dislike for Ann and telling people that Ann is too inexperienced to follow in Tim’s
 footsteps.

 Ann has spent three days in the job getting to know everyone in the office and the systems that are in
 place. As yet, although she has spoken informally to members of the sales team, she has not met
 with them formally. A sales meeting has been planned for five days’ time.

 Ann's Divisional Manager has told her that he feels that the North East team has become complacent
 and lazy. Results in the last six months have been poor and if they don’t improve there may need to
 be a cost cutting exercise, that may involve staff reductions, both with administration and possibly
 within the sales team itself.

 DEVELOPMENT EXERCISE 3. THE NEW MANAGER
 Here are some answers to Ann's problem.
 Compare them with your own:

 Ann should be careful not to make the common mistakes that are made by new sales managers. She
 should first of all meet with her line manager and get her own objectives agreed

 She should find out what she is expected to achieve and in what timescale. She should work with her
 manager and prioritise her various objectives and negotiate how they will work together, what the
 manager’s information requirements are and what support might be available to her

 She will then be best advised to spend time, as she has started to do, in looking at how the team
 works as a team, the systems that are in place and getting to know the people. At this stage it is often
 a good idea to listen rather than tell and to avoid the temptation of reorganising all the systems until
 she is settled in the job

 She has called the team together for a meeting and this will begin the process of her getting
 established as the manager. She should be careful not to try and win everyone over at the first
 meeting, as it is likely some team members will need time to adjust to her leadership style

 One good tactic for the meeting is to get team members to make presentations on their progress to
 date and give information on your overall objectives and plans for the future; being careful not to
 knock the previous regime. She can then give the team her overall objectives for the next few months
 and begin the process of defining and setting standards of performance

 If there are team members who are unhappy with her appointment, she should be careful not to
 attack them publicly at the first meeting. She might end up by uniting the team against her. Far
 better to meet with them individually and let them air their frustrations in private. She can get a very
 strong message across at this stage that while she understands their frustration, everyone has a job
 to do and targets to meet

 If at a later stage they continue to cause problems, this then becomes a disciplinary problem that she
 will have to deal with. She must, however, set high standards and keep to them. In the long term this
 will earn her the respect of the majority of the team and bring improved results

 Over the next 3 months, Ann can begin to implement change and work on developing the individuals
 who make up her team. In the early stages she should be task oriented and once the team begins to
 achieve better results, she can focus more on relationship issues

 She also needs to keep her manager informed of her progress and keep the team informed as to how
 they are performing. Her style will be very much hands on and this will probably remain the same
 until the team begins to really perform and achieve results

 The overall message to Ann is to take her time and not be forced into taking action without thinking
 through her overall strategy. There is a Latin phrase that says festina lente, which means hurry slowly
 and this represents good advice to anyone in
 the position of taking over a new work team

 TAKING OVER NEW SALES TEAMS
 When taking over a new sales team that you have not managed before, here are 20 ground rules that
 can help to improve your likelihood of success

 1. Take your time
 All new managers want to be successful and will quickly see changes that need to be made. However,
 success does not come overnight, so make a mental note to take your time before making changes or
 expressing opinions.

 2. Understand why you were promoted
 You were promoted because people felt you had the ability to be successful. It is natural to feel
 nervous when taking on a new challenge, however, be aware that most people will want you to do
 well and help will be available both from inside and outside your sales team.

 3. Find out your objectives and timescales
 Don't forget you have a manager who should be aware of what you are expected to achieve and how
 much time it should realistically take. You need a clear idea of objectives and priorities before taking
 on the role as sales manager.

 4. Manage the relationship with your manager
 The ability to manage ‘upwards’ is equally important as the ability to manage downwards. Make best
 use of the knowledge and experience of your manager and don’t be afraid to ask for help if you need
 it.

 5. Get to know the team
 Management is about achieving results through people. Take time to get to know the team and avoid
 making snap judgments about people’s abilities. Avoid the temptation of making quick changes or
 expressing opinions until you have had time to analyse the true situation. Be aware that the team will
 need time to get used to you and your unique style.

 6. Find out how the team works
 Take time to find out the systems and procedures used by the team. Again, avoid making comments
 or changes until you have had time to study the whole situation.

 7. Analyse the teams results
 Look at what the team has achieved in the past. What does it tell you about the teams’ strengths and
 weaknesses? Are there areas of individual performance that may cause concern?

 8. Analyse how the team works as a team
 Observe what goes on when the team is at work. How good is team spirit and morale? Does the team
 have common understanding of its goals? How much support does the team give itself? How can you
 influence the team as its new leader?

 9. Set high standards for yourself and the team
 People respond well to high standards of performance in their manager and will perform much better
 if they have a clear idea of what is expected of them. If you set high standards for yourself make sure
 they are attainable by others and that team members can see the benefits from having high
 standards within the team.

 10. Explain what you want to achieve
 Tell the team what you see as your vision for them and yourself. No matter where the team is now, if
 it has a common view of where it is going there is a greater likelihood of the vision becoming a
 reality. Ask for the team's views and ideas. The team is more likely to ‘buy’ your vision if it has a
 chance to contribute its own ideas.

 11. Lead by example
 This is a powerful way of influencing team behaviour. If you insist on good timekeeping for example,
 make sure you practice what you preach.

 12. Support Senior Management
 You can enhance your credibility within the team by supporting the company and its decisions even
 though, at times, you may feel they have got it wrong. You are the main contact between the team
 and senior management. An important part of your role is to ensure each knows how the other feels
 and the team understands the reasons for decisions by senior management.

 13. Meet with the team individually
 Once you have settled in to your new role take time to meet with individual team members. Find out
 their goals and aspirations. Communicate your vision to them and get their commitment to you and
 the rest of the team.

 14. Encourage success
 This can be done by praising positive behaviour within the team, but also by reprimanding team
 members who behave in a negative way. Praise in itself is not enough as a motivator. Lack of
 discipline and failure to reprimand for negative behaviour can demotivate others in the team.

 15. Maintain high standards
 Having set standards for the team these should be maintained so that everyone in the team knows
 the ‘rules’ and sticks to them. If you set high standards there is a good chance they will be achieved.
 (This is equally true of low standards!)

 16. Be sensitive to the needs of the team
 Part of a competent manager’s job is to be aware of how the team is feeling at any particular time
 and to understand that the team is made up of people, not machines. There may be conflict between
 supporting senior management and looking after the interests of the team. This makes the manager’s
 role challenging and worthwhile, but never easy.

 17. Manage inter-team relationships
 Teams do not work in isolation. They need the support of other teams in the organisation to be
 successful. Develop your network of managers and others and encourage the team to do likewise.

 18. Pay attention to detail
 Successful managers know what is going on in their teams and pay particular attention to detail. This
 improves the overall quality of their work and keeps the team on its toes.

 19. Involve the team in goal setting
 Wherever possible give team members the opportunity to contribute to the goal setting process. This
 increases the commitment of the team to its own success and helps build team spirit and morale.

 20. Give regular feedback to the team
 Tell the team, as a whole, and individual team members how they are doing. This is a positive aid to
 motivation and helps to encourage repeat behaviour. Also, get some feedback about how you are
 doing. It can feel uncomfortable at first, but is a powerful tool for your own self-development.

 DEVELOPMENT EXERCISE 4. THE SALES CONFERENCE
 The following activity can be used at team meetings to improve inter team
 relationships and communication skills

 To carry out this team exercise break the team into groups of 3, or 4 people, plus an observer and
 announce that you have a problem for them to solve and the team that gets the first correct answer
 wins.

 Here is the problem:

 John Smith is a Sales Manager and he has 5 people in his sales team:

 Alan Jones
 Mary Baker
 Judith Armer
 Harry Lonfield
 Keith McShane

 They all attended a conference recently and were allocated 6 seats, in the front row.

 They were given numbers 3 to 8.

 You have 20 minutes to work out, from the4 pieces of information supplied, who sat next to who.
 There is only one possible solution.

 1. Alan sat next to Judith in a higher numbered seat.
 2. Keith was not in seats 3 or 8.
 3. John’s seat was 2 numbers higher than Harry.
 4. Mary’s seat number was odd and Judith’s even.

 DEVELOPMENT EXERCISE 4. THE SALES CONFERENCE
 In your group, answer the following questions about the previous exercise:

 1. How did your group go about solving the problem?




 2. What actions, within the group, helped to solve the problem?




 3. What actions made problem solving difficult?




 4. If you were given the problem again how would you go about solving it?

 DEVELOPMENT EXERCISE 4. THE SALES CONFERENCE
 SOLUTION

 The problem cannot be solved just with the basic information, so some lateral thinking is required to
 find a solution. Instead of trying to work out who is sitting where, the trick is to work out who isn’t
 sitting where. The key piece of information says that ...there is only one possible solution

 Taking seat 3 as an example, seat 3 must contain either Harry or Mary. As there is only one correct
 solution to the problem we can assume for the sake of argument that seat 3 contains Harry.

 This puts John in seat 5, which means that Judith cannot be in seat 4 as she is sitting next to Alan.
 Harry is in seat 3 so the only other person who could be in seat 4 is Keith. Because John is not in seat
 8 seat 8 must contain Judith and therefore seat 7 must contain Alan. This puts Harry in 3, John in 5
 and Alan in 7, but this cannot be the solution because Mary is not sitting in one of the odd seat
 numbers, as it says in the brief.

 This means our initial assumption was wrong, Harry was not in seat 3 and therefore seat 3 must
 contain Mary.

 By using the same process of deduction with the rest of the clues we find the only solution to be:
 Seat No.                                       Team member
 3                                              Mary
 4                                              Judith
 5                                              Alan
 6                                              Harry
 7                                              Keith
 8                                              John

 When the team has solved the problem, ask them to complete the team review sheet and lead a
 discussion based on their answers

 The most common outcome is that, eventually, the groups will solve the problem.

 The learning points are that with better communication and planning, the achievement of the task
 would have been made much easier

 SALES PLANNING AND TARGETING
 A look at the basics

 Most of us in sales are set sales targets. These are clear objective measures of what we need to
 achieve to be successful. In order to achieve our targets we need to translate them from module
 targets, expressed in units of products or services, or Financial targets expressed in revenue or profit
 terms, into levels of sales activity It can be daunting to receive an annual or a quarterly target and
 we need therefore to break this down into daily sales activity

 The overriding principles that we need to understand when looking at sales targeting are:

 1. Key Ratios
 2. The Pareto principle applies: i.e. 80% of our business comes from 20% of our customers
 3. Lead times

 KEY RATIOS

 The amount you sell, in the medium to long term, is directly related to the number of customers, or
 potential customers that you contact. Sales techniques help us to become more proficient in sales;
 however, ratios exist that can help us predict how much sales activity (input) is required to achieve a
 certain level of sales (output). Of course we can never be totally sure if the next telephone call we
 make will result in an appointment being made, or that the next sales call will result in an order. Over
 the medium to long term, however, we will see ratios begin to emerge that will be fairly constant
 over time.

 Two examples of key ratios that could influence your sales success:

      Telephone Calls: Appointments made
      Appointments made: Sales Agreed

 THE PARETO PRINCIPLE

 This principle says that 80% of our business is likely to be generated by 20% of our customers. We
 need therefore to devote a greater proportion of our time to our ‘key’ accounts in order that we can
 make best use of their sales potential.




   Web: www.mtdsalestraining.com | Tel: 0333 320 2883 | Email: enquiries@mtdsalestraining.com        24
MTD Sales Training                                          The Sales Manager’s Guidebook – Module 1


 Let us look at a simple example of how key ratios can help us to break down targets into sales
 activity. Let us assume, for the example that follows, that there is no repeat business involved:

 Example
 Annual target                                                           £630,000
 Average sales value                                                      £14,000
 Number of sales required                                              45 per annum
 Number of weeks                                                            45
 Average sales per week                                                      1
 Appointments : Sales                                                       5:1
 Appointments per week                                                       5
 Telephone calls : Appointments made                                        6:1
 Sales leads required per week                                              30

 So, we are saying, on average, we need to make six telephone calls in order to book an appointment.
 Of the appointments we carry out, on average, one sale results from five appointments.

 Therefore, we need to make:

 225 appointments in order to make 45 sales (ratio 5:1) and in order to book those appointments we
 need to carry out 1,350 telephone calls during the year (ratio 6:1). This then has implications for our
 marketing efforts in that we need to find over 1,000 potential customers to contact if we are going to
 achieve our target.

 LEAD TIMES
 Another important aspect of sales planning of which we need to be aware is lead times; that is, the
 gap between our initial contact with a customer and the final agreement being reached and the sale
 closed.

 Lead times will vary between industries and can be anything between 1 week and 2 years. What they
 do mean is that there will be a time lag between activity and results.

 If you work to long lead times the results you achieve today may have been earned in previous
 months, or even years.

 Sales techniques can help reduce lead times by making the decision to purchase more urgent and
 increasing potential customers’ general awareness of the benefits of our products.

 The main learning point for us all in sales is to keep our activity levels, that is the number of
 customers we see, as high as possible, and to measure and understand our lead times so that we can
 anticipate and programme into our activity sales that will occur, not just this week, but also in the
 future.

 We can also avoid the temptation of slowing down when our results are good. Lead times mean that,
 by doing this, our results will suffer in the future. One of the secrets to sales success is to achieve
 consistent levels of activity over the long term. If we do this, key ratios and lead times will ensure our
 success.

 SALES TARGETING
 Planning the efforts of others

 One key role of a sales manager is the targeting of the Sales Team. Targeting is an integral part of a
 salesperson’s job and the effective use of sales targets is a vital skill for sales managers to master.

 Most salespeople are targeted on the results they achieve. As we have seen, these outputs can be
 measured in financial terms or in module terms. An example of this could be sales turnover for the
 period, or number of units of each product sold.

 However, there are problems in targeting outputs alone. Targeting outputs:

      • Does not always promote ‘positive behaviour’ in salespeople
      • Can demotivate the salesperson
      • Is difficult to ‘manage’

 Salespeople who are only targeted on outputs are potentially able to manipulate the system and may
 act in ways, which don’t benefit the delivery of profitable sales. They may take short cuts and
 concentrate on activity that produces short-term results. They may feel unwilling or unable to
 concentrate on activity that produces benefits in the medium to long term.

 Targeting outputs only can demotivate in two ways. Firstly, if the target is set too high and the
 salesperson feels it is unachievable there is every possibility that he or she will feel it is not worth
 trying to achieve the impossible. Similarly, if the target is too low, the salesperson may achieve target
 quickly then stop trying to achieve more, because he or she has no incentive to do so.

 Targeting outputs can be difficult to manage because of the lead times between the initial sales
 activity and the completion of the sale. This means the manager cannot link today’s results with
 today’s activity and is therefore left with no choice other than to try and influence the salesperson by
 giving general advice on the whole spectrum of sales and organisational skills. As a motivational
 technique this is ineffective.

 The most efficient way to target salespeople is with a combination of ‘inputs and outputs’ that follow
 the whole sales process from beginning to end. This works on the premise that salesforce activity i.e.
 the number of sales calls made, directly influences results.

MTD Sales Training                                       The Sales Manager’s Guidebook – Module 1


 If we break down our sales process it may look something like this:


                                    Salesperson telephones
                                        prospective client


                                         Client agrees to
                                          appointment



                                Salesperson meets customer
                                  and produces a proposal



                                     Salesperson presents
                                     proposal to customer



                                Customer agrees to proposal
                                  and purchases product

 Also, there may be several processes that apply to different products, or customer types.

 As sales managers, we need to measure the outputs, such as the £ value of sales generated, and their
 profitability, as well as the mix of products sold, against plan. However, we also need to measure how
 effectively the salesperson managed their time in achieving those sales and how effective they were
 at the various aspects of their job.

 This means tracking the sales process and measuring inputs:

          How many telephone calls were made in the period?

          How many were converted into appointments?

          How many appointments produced proposals?

          How many proposals were converted into sales?

          What was the average value of each sale?

          What was the average cost of each sale?


 This process helps the sales manager to keep track of how well the team and individuals are
 performing and historical data can be used to forecast future business.

 SALES PLANNING
 A guide to preparing sales plans

 All of us in sales, if we are to be truly successful, must recognise the need for sales planning and be
 able to produce a sales plan for ourselves whether as salesperson, or sales manager.

 The sales planning cycle can be described as follows:

      1. Set objectives
      2. Identify resources
      3. Produce plan
      4. Implement plan
      5. Review results and amend plan

 Objectives need to be:

 Achievable but challenging
 Realistic
 Understood by everyone
 Measurable
 Time bound

 A simple example could be the objective to sell £100,000 worth of Product X in the twelve months
 commencing 1 April. Other objectives could relate to market share, market penetration, the
 proportion of turnover in relation to key accounts, sales activity levels, profitability targets etc.

 Resources need to be included in the sales plan, as it may be necessary to recruit or bring in
 additional resources for particular targets to be met. Also production capacity will need to be taken
 into consideration.

 The plan itself needs to be flexible and to take into account any likely changes in the market,
 unforeseen factors (such as staff turnover and recruitment) that reoccur and any other external
 factors that could affect achievement of the overall objectives.

 Once the plan begins to be implemented it needs to be reviewed on a regular basis and changes
 made to the original plan as circumstances dictate. Remember, sales plans cannot be written in stone
 and need to be flexible enough to deal with those unforeseen circumstances that affect all
 businesses.

 A typical sales plan should include the following sections:

 SECTION                     DESCRIPTION

 Sales Objectives            Short, medium and long term objectives that relate to the objectives of
                             the overall business. Analysis of sales strategy.

                             equipment etc.

 Market Analysis             A review of the market which looks at the market now and in the future.
                             This can include analysis of competitor activity and an analysis of existing
                             Accounts.

 Product Range               The range of products or services available for sale, new products to be

 RECRUITING AND SELECTING SALES STAFF
 Beginning the process

 When a vacancy occurs within a team or department, it is a good opportunity to review your
 selection strategy. One of the first questions to ask is "Do we need to recruit a replacement at all?" If
 you do need to recruit, a second question could be "How will this vacancy be filled and how much will
 it cost?"

 Potential vacancies occur because of advances in technology, promotion, people leaving, expansion,
 or structural changes within the organisation

 * Alternatives to recruitment could be:
        – ignore the problem
        – reorganise the work
        – use overtime
        – increase use of new technology
        – stagger the hours of existing staff
        – train staff to be more efficient
        – employ someone part-time
        – sub-contract the work
        – use an agency

 There are advantages and disadvantages to each of these options, which could have consequences in
 the longer term to the strategy of the organisation. Having decided to recruit a new member of staff
 there is a choice of methods of recruitment available to us as managers. Here are some of the most
 popular methods of finding suitable recruits:

        • The Internet
        • Advertising in professional or trade journals
        • Advertising internally
        • Advertising in National Newspaper
        • Advertising in Local Newspaper
        • Recruitment Consultants

 JOB ANALYSIS
 Having decided to recruit a new member of staff it is important to prepare a thorough analysis of the
 job vacancy you wish to fill. Job analysis is the process of collecting and analysing information about
 the job itself and the person who would be best suited to do that job. It is interesting to note that the
 personality of the job applicant is an important part of this process. Most people are hired for their
 technical skills and fired for their behavioural skills.

 For the purposes of recruitment and selection you need to prepare a Job Specification and a Person
 Specification.

 JOB SPECIFICATION

 This document contains information about the job itself, why the job exists, what the job is, what
 standards of performance are required and what authority is given to the holder of the job.

 The standard format used for this seminar can be adapted to suit the particular needs of your
 organisation, however the information it contains is:

      1. The job title.
      2. The history and development of the job.
      3. The reporting structure (above and below the job holder).
      4. The objectives of the job.
      5. Key activities.
      6. Standards of performance.
      7. Authority
              - to act
              - to report
              - to recommend
              - to delegate.
      8. Job difficulties.
      9. Training available to job holder.
      10. Decision to hire (by whom).
      11. Physical/social environment.

 PERSON SPECIFICATION

 The person specification looks at the kind of person that would be best suited for a particular job.
 Perfect candidates rarely apply for vacant positions, however by analysing the person specification
 we can minimise the likelihood of making the mistake of giving the right job to the wrong person, or
 vice versa.

 The information contained in the person specification is broken down into those qualities that are
 essential and those that are useful. The form also asks the question ‘why’ in order to help the
 manager minimise the likelihood of his own prejudices influencing the person specification.

 So, for example, if you are recruiting a copy typist it is unlikely that mobility will be an essential
 prerequisite of the potential candidate.

 The information contained in the person specification is:

      1. Age range.*
      2. Qualifications.
      3. Experience.
      4. Skills.
      5. Knowledge.
      6. Personal Qualities.
      7. Special Features.

 Essential qualities must be measurable while useful qualities can be either measurable or qualitative.
 The manager should be constantly asking himself why a quality or competency is essential or useful.

 Legislation currently states that when specifying age restrictions they must be justifiable for reasons
 other than gender.

 DEVELOPMENT EXERCISE 6. JOB ANALYSIS
 The purpose of this exercise is for you to prepare a job specification and person specification using
 the forms provided. To do this, select a current job held by one member of your sales team, and use
 this as your example

 Ensure the Person and Job Specification forms are completed as fully as possible. Standard answers
 have been provided, for your reference, using a job description that we have provided for a medical
 sales representative

 You will need a job description, for the sales job you are working with. If you don’t have one, you can
 produce your own, using the format for the medical sales representative, below.

 The examples we have given will form the basis of an exercise in preparing a set of questions, for the
 subsequent job interview, later in this chapter.

 NOTES:

 The person specification allows us to focus on the most likely candidate to succeed. It also imposes a
 discipline on the interviewer, to ask the question why, on various issues

 The age range, for example, where it has been found that managers will often hire people younger
 than they are, due either to prejudice, or lack of confidence in managing someone older

 In this example, while the overall age range is 22 to 50, we would prefer someone in the 25 to 50 age
 group, which is more likely to include someone with work experience

 Some skills and qualities are non-negotiable, as these are pre-requisites for the job In other cases,
 extra experience and knowledge will help the successful candidate to get assimilated into the new
 job role quicker than someone with less experience and knowledge

 The next stage enables us to look at the job itself, in more depth, prior to preparing for the actual
 interviews

 THE JOB INTERVIEW
 If you are holding job interviews one of the most important phases is the planning and preparation.
 As with most managerial skills the more planning you do the more successful will be the interview.
 Research has shown the following problems occur with job interviews.

 Speed of decision-making:

 Most decisions to hire are made in the first few minutes of the interview. Once these decisions are
 made they are rarely changed. Beware of subjective decision making.

 Experience:

 Most interviewers don’t get better with experience. Regular training on interviewing skills and
 feedback from colleagues is required to keep the interviewer ‘up to scratch’.

 Pressure to fill the job:

 Where there is pressure to fill the job the interviewer tends to rate people higher than he otherwise
 would. Beware of solving short-term recruitment problems while creating long-term people
 problems.

 Memory:

 Most interviewers rely on memory and those who don’t take notes tend to rate candidates higher,
 overall, than those who do. Note taking should be required for all interviews.

 Structure:

 Those interviewers who prepare and carry out a structured interview are better able to evaluate and
 compare different candidates.

MTD Sales Training                                         The Sales Manager’s Guidebook – Module 1



 PREPARING FOR THE INTERVIEW
 A structured method for preparation will ensure that both the interviewer and interviewee get the
 most from the time available.

 The recommended structure is:

      1. Review the job and person specifications.
      2. Prepare a list of questions relating to the person, his work history, his education history, and
         his interests outside work.
      3. Structure the interviews to give you 30 minutes between each one. This gives you time to
         review and discuss each candidate and keeps you fresh for interviews later in the day.
      4. Plan for someone to meet the interviewees and arrange expenses, tea or coffee etc.
      5. Arrange to use a room that is free of noise and distractions and suits your needs.
      6. Review each applicant’s details before each interview.

 AGENDA FOR THE INTERVIEW

 It is important to understand that the interviewee will be nervous and the first thing to do is to put
 the candidate at his ease in order to get the best for him (and you) from the interview.

 The structure recommended for the interview is:

     1.   Welcome the candidate: Introduce yourself, tell the candidate who you are and what you
          do. Try to get them to relax
     2.   Set the agenda: Say what will happen at the interview and how long it should take
     3.   Brief review of the job: A brief summary can help to focus the interviewee and ensure he, or
          she understands the nature of the position being applied for
     4.   Ask for questions: Give the interviewee the chance to ask any questions he, or she may wish
          to ask at this point. Avoid answering them at the appropriate time
     5.   Ask questions: Begin by asking questions about their work history. Spend 50% of the time
          concentrating on their current job then ask questions about previous jobs. Question other
          areas after work history. Ask specific questions to gather factual information on previous
          successes. Don’t accept bland answers and ask follow-up questions to ensure you get the full
          facts.
     6.   Describe the job in detail: Be honest in describing the job. Give some of the minus factors as
          well as the pluses. Answer any questions relating to the job they may have asked earlier.
     7.   Ask for questions: Give the interviewee the opportunity to ask any questions about the job,
          the company etc.
     8.   Summarise: End the interview by summarising which will happen next and thank the
          interviewee for attending.

 OTHER POINTS TO REMEMBER WHEN CONDUCTING JOB INTERVIEWS:

 •     Start and finish on time
 •     Take notes during the interview
 •     Concentrate on the applicant and his point of view. Avoid wasting time telling of your views and
       experiences
 •     Use follow-up questions if the first answer you get is unclear
 •     Use open questions (what, where, why, when, how) to establish rapport and get the candidate
       talking
 •     Ensure the candidate keeps to relevant points
 •     Keep to your structure for the interview
 •     Concentrate on the candidates’ career details and ask questions relating to the person
       specification
 •     Ensure the candidate gives examples of previous success. Ask questions that begin "Can you give
       me an example of when ...".
 •     Be as objective as possible in your final choice of candidate

 REFERENCES

 References are a poor predictor of suitable candidates. They are often biased in favour of, or against
 the candidate and should be obtained only to confirm the decision to hire, or give evidence of
 previous deviant or criminal behaviour.

 Telephone references can be useful. Some questions to ask:

       1. In what capacity did you know Mr Smith?
       2. When did he join your company?
       3. When did he leave?
       4. How well did he fit into your organisation?
       5. How good a salesperson was he?
       6. Why did he leave?
       7. Would you re-employ him?
       8. In your opinion, for what sort of position would he be best suited?

 DEVELOPMENT EXERCISE 7.
 PREPARING FOR THE INTERVIEW
 Based on the Job Description, Person and Job Specification, on the previous pages, produce a list of
 questions to ask the candidate, designed to find out their relevant job experience, in relation to 3 key
 areas:

 1. The achievement of sales targets
 2. Managing their territory without close supervision
 3. Identifying new business opportunities

 Try to construct the questions so that the candidate is talking about past events that happened,
 rather than theoretical future events. For example:

 It is very important that you achieve your targets in this job. Think of the last time you were behind
 with your target and having problems. What did you do to solve them?

 If, at some time in the future you were not hitting target, what would you do?

 The first of these questions is the most effective, because it encourages the candidate to talk about
 real events and it is a better measure of character to see how people respond to failure than to
 success

 Avoid questions like What do you feel makes a good salesperson, or Describe yourself in 3 words.
 Questions like these are regularly asked during interviews. What do they tell us, other than the
 person can think on their feet, or have the knack of being able to give a plausible answer at short
 notice?

 What they do not do, is to give us evidence that the candidate can do the job, based on previous
 experience.

 Because we are looking for evidence of previous achievement, it is possible to produce a list of
 questions prior to seeing the Curriculum Vitae of the individual candidates

 This is good practice. Once you have prepared your basic list of questions, they can be modified to
 suit each candidate. Producing the questions in this way, gives the interviewing process more
 objectivity and focus.
