                       What is Sales Training?



It sounds self-explanatory. Sales training is the act of training your sales team.
The definition gets complex when you consider how many types of sales there
are. A sales rep trained in telemarketing might not do well in field sales.



                                           Not to mention the techniques, product
                                           knowledge, and mindset that create the
                                           core of a successful salesperson.

                                           Sales training that works is an
                                           investment that reinvigorates your team
                                           and revenue. It will be suited toward
                                           your industry and personalized for your
                                           business.

                                            The training itself can be a motivational
seminar or an in-depth workshop. Sales reps can be trained one-on-one or in a
group. Your reps can even use sales exercises to train each other for practically
nothing.

      Why Should You
       Consider Sales
            Training?



A lot of sales reps start their career
without any training at all. The sink-
or-swim nature of sales creates the
idea that good performance is
intuitive. You either swim (and sell)
or sink (and fail).

It’s true, sales is a difficult career.
That being said, you don’t need natural talent to succeed. Like all difficult things,
salesmanship can be learned - even mastered - with the right training.

Considering the fact that is costs an average of $114,957 to replace a sales rep,
throwing your sales team a life preserver can benefit your entire organization.

Investing in sales training sends a positive message to your sales team. It shows
interest in their performance, results, and careers. It also happens to be the
perfect recipe to bring out the top-performers on your team.

Before we dive into the fundamentals of proper sales training, we need to cover

how to choose the right program for your team. Defining your sales process is
the best way to understand how to improve it.

                      Benefits of Sales Training



Sales Training has numerous benefits, both for your sales team and company-
wide. The importance of sales training is well-documented. Recent statistics
show how essential a well-trained sales team can be for the bottom-line of your
                                                       organization.


                                                       50% of reps give up the
                                                       1st time a prospect

                                                       66% of all salespeople

Over half of all salespeople close at less than 40%


40% of salespeople don’t understand their customer needs.

Continuous training gives 50% higher net sales per employee


77% of executive buyers claim salespeople don’t understand their issues and
where they can help, and 78% claim salespeople do not have relevant examples
or case studies to share with them.


A well-trained sales team has a dramatic impact on company performance, not to
mention the individual benefits. After receiving sales training, the sales activity of
a rep increases drastically.


Sales training inspires and motivates your team, making them eager to practice
their new skills and engage customers. Increased customer engagement equals
more overall sales, an effect that compounds over time.


Sales training has the added benefit of improving confidence, especially when
reps are trained by an authority-figure in sales. Confident reps will naturally sell
more. Combining the increased confidence of sales training with the strategies
your sales team learns is a definite recipe for success.

    How to Cut Your Sales Team’s Training Time By
                                          Half


Sales training is only half the battle. Your reps need to be efficient and productive
as quickly as possible. Maintaining your sales team’s focus throughout the sales
cycle can be a balancing act in itself.


So much time and money is invested into
hiring and onboarding sales reps that any
decrease in the amount of time spent
selling will eat into your company’s profit.


Unfortunately, only 39% of a sales rep’s
time is spent selling or interacting with
prospects and customers.


The time sales reps spend on pre-sale
and post-sale activities has increased
15%. Time spent on non-sales
administrative work is up 21% as well.


This paints an unfortunate picture for
productivity. Why invest time and money




↑                                                                                11
into sales training when your team spends so much time not selling?


L’Oreal asked a similar question when they examined their onboarding process.
Their solution was to find a way to reduce training time while maintaining scale
and sales efficiency.


The L’Oreal sales team adopted Badger Maps as their solution, reducing their
training time for new reps by 50%.


L’Oreal reps were taking an average of 1 year to reach full productivity. Badger
reduced total training time to 6 months. Badger acts as L’Oreal’s training
program by educating new reps on territory, customers, and best practices.


Badger Maps allows new reps to learn sales essentials at a much faster rate.
Customer information, routes, and new leads are provided directly through
Badger. This process saves L’Oreal valuable time that can be invested into a
greater ROI for the sales team.


The key to efficient sales training is overcoming problem areas. Whether reps
need guidance in product knowledge, methodology, technique, or improving
performance in the field - facing these obstacles head-on is the best way to
develop a master sales team.

            Choosing your Sales Training Program



Choosing the sales training program
that’s right for your company depends
entirely on your sales process. Your
sales process is the customer-facing
side of your business. Everything
leading up to (and resulting in) a sale is
considered part of the process.

What type of business are you? The
sales process for a b2b company is
different than that of a consumer-facing
business. Leads are gathered
differently, there are more decision
makers, and a distinct form of product
knowledge is required.

Choosing a sales training program
that isn’t the right fit for your business is
like throwing money away. Here’s a
brief overview on how to define your
sales process to make sure your
training investment is well-spent.

                            Types of Sales


                          There are generally two types of sales. Your sales
                          process might involve a bit of both. Narrowing down
                          the elements you rely on from each will show you
                          what your sales training should focus on.

                          Transactional
                          A transactional sale is simple and short-term. These
                          types of sales require less trust from the consumer.
                          The buying decision is heavily influenced by impulse.
                          The elements of a transactional sale to keep in mind:

                          -Sale based on price, features, and availability
                          -Buyer’s enjoy comparing and negotiating, price
shopping
-Sell in high volume at low price
-Requires customers ready to buy now

Transactional sales are less complex. They involve commodities and impulse
buys. Salespeople who thrive in transactional sales are able to quickly recall
product knowledge and competitor pricing while maintaining an upbeat attitude.

Consultative
These are complex and long-term sales. They are often service or solution based
and require trust between buyer and seller.

-Sale based on value and benefits
-Buyer’s often afraid of making the      wrong choice

-Sell in low volume at high price.
-Requires educated customers

Consultative sales are high pressure. They require reps who can understand and
educate consumers while building a strong sales relationship.

    Defining Your Sales
          Process


Defining your sales process with
the above sales knowledge in
mind is essential. Any one area of
your sales process might be
based in transactional or
consultative sales. Examining
what’s working and what isn’t
shows you on the type of sales
training you’ll need.

Look for improvements that can be made in these areas of your sales process:

Lead Generation
Finding your customers, or helping them find you. This might be accomplished
through cold calling, advertisements, inbound marketing, or other forms of lead
generation.

Lead generation is the most essential part of the sales process. If you don’t have
customers coming in you’ll have a tough time selling anything.

There are two types of leads:

Cold
These are people you’ve either cold       called, emailed, or approached blindly.



↑                                                                              16
These are leads who haven’t shown any interest in what you sell.

Warm
These are prospects that have shown interest. They might find you your
company naturally or be a cold lead that you’ve built a relationship with.

Your sales team needs to interact with leads with a strategy based on how
they’re collected.

Qualifying
Reaching out to the list you’ve created. This is the part of your process where
your leads are contacted.

Qualifying your customers is just confirming their interest. You’re making sure
that your business fits their needs so that neither of you wastes any time. Some
transactional sales might end here.

Demonstrating Value
Communicating the value of your product to your buyer. Value demonstration
becomes more effective as your sales rep learns about your buyer.

This is where sales skills come into play. Your buyer needs to be educated on
how your product will improve their life. Communicating the value of the product
is a sales reps primary job.

Convincing
Getting a decision from your buyer. Conquering objections is a key part of the
convince phase.

Your prospect will have doubts or fears about their decision. Convincing your
buyer requires building trust and communicating value to them.

Closing
The actual sale. This will vary depending on the complexity of your sale.
Contracts might be finalized or new terms agreed on.



↑                                                                                 17
A sale doesn’t end when it’s closed. Relationship management is an important
part of keeping your customers happy and coming back.

                       Types of Sales Training




Public vs Private Sales Training
Public sales training programs are events or seminars that involve a presenter
and an audience. They can be motivational or cover a general sales system
focused on improving revenue. A presentation can be a great motivational tool
for transactional salespeople.

Private sales training is much more in-depth. Your team will receive personal
instruction on the sales skills and methodology suited to your industry. Private
training is a good idea if long-term       core improvement is needed.

Product Sales Training
Product sales training is your sales team’s knowledge of the product they sell
and how it fits into the lives of your customers. Any sales rep can benefit from
greater product knowledge.

Sales Methodology Training
Sales methodology training improves the approach your sales team is taking
throughout the process.

Your methodology is how you collect, handle, and retain customers.

Sales Skill Training
Sales skills can be thought of as how well your team is carrying out their sales
methodology.

Sales skill training focuses on the nitty-gritty of sales. Communication skills and
selling techniques are personally taught and usually supported by live practice.

Sales Automation Training
Sales automation training involves making your reps more knowledgeable about
the tools they use. Lead generation and CRM software are necessary
components of any sales process.

Learning how to use them effectively is an important part of sales training that is
often passed over.

Each type of sales training is catered toward a specific stage of your sales
process. If you’ve analyzed your sales operations you probably have a good idea
about which area could use improvement.

The rest of this guide will cover the types of sales training in detail; including
fundamentals, popular programs, and strategies of each.

                       Product Sales Training



Product sales training educates your
sales team on what you sell and how it
helps your market. It might seem like
common sense, but you shouldn’t
underestimate the power of product
knowledge.


A strong understanding of product
knowledge benefits a consultative team
and enables sales efforts.


This section will cover various
strategies that use product knowledge
to close deals.


Product Sales Training
Overview


Product sales training is an all-around
study of what you sell and how it fits into the marketplace. Generally, product




↑                                                                                 21
sales training covers:


Your Customer’s Needs


Your customer isn’t buying your product out of the kindness of their heart.
Product training covers why your customer buys from you - including their
problems and frustrations.


Your Product as a Solution


Your product is solving a problem for your buyer. Connecting your sales team to
this reality sets the tone for customer interactions, making them beneficial for the
rep and the customer.


Industry Regulations


Each rep has to act in accordance with industry standards and regulations. This
material is often dry and overlooked, making it all the more important.


Your Marketplace


Understanding the ecosystem your product lives in gives your sales team a
broader perspective. Your product is one of many your customer might use in
their daily life.


Your Value Proposition


What is your company's mission? Why do you exist and interact with customers?
Answering these questions will provide your value proposition, the leading benefit

of what you sell.




Your Competition (and how you win)


Your competitive advantage relative to your competition. This is the unique
selling point you have in your market. Your customer service, support, or the
superior quality of your product are all potential advantages.


Common Challenges of Product Sales Training


Product sales training is obviously important, why isn’t it more common? When it
does occur, why isn’t it more effective?


There are 3 common problems with product sales training:


Information Overload:


Information overload describes situations where there's a massive amount to
learn without the proper time to learn it.


Product sales training is filled with information that’s only applicable in unique
situations.


The sad truth is product knowledge without context isn't remembered as well as
relevant information with a basis in daily life. Overwhelming your sales team with
information that doesn’t have immediate relevance results in very little of it being

retained


Sales Effectiveness:


Customer needs are varied and complex. A sales team’s effectiveness is based
on their ability to understand these needs without relying on scripts. Balancing
product knowledge with real-world application is necessary for sales
effectiveness, but also very difficult.


Time Crunch:


Sales teams must remain competitive and reach full-productivity as quickly as
possible. That means sales team training is becoming an increasingly time-
sensitive investment.


There’s constant pressure for reps to become competent quickly. That often
leaves little time for the sales team to understand as much product knowledge as
they should.




Product Sales Training Solution Strategies


The common problems of product sales training can be avoided altogether.
Incorporate these strategies into your training program to ensure your team
absorbs the information.

actually encounter. Creating relevant scenarios for your reps to learn from will
avoid information overload.


How to create case-based Product Sales Training:


1. Get your most experienced reps, managers, and training developers to create
the training material using as much product knowledge as possible.


2. Use their knowledge to define the most commonly encountered sales
situations. Categorize them by types that are relevant to your business (high
value sale, cold call, consultative appointment, transactional sale, etc)


3.Work through these sales situations to discover the thought process behind
each. Really digging into each type of sales situation will let you know what kind
of product knowledge is required for each situation.


4. Any non-essential product information can be compiled into a reference guide
for less-common situations.


5. Incorporate the sales methodology and skills your top reps use in each
scenario.


6. Now that your sales scenarios involve relevant product knowledge you’ll
always have engaging product sales training material.


Point-of-Need Information:


Point-Of-Need Information is product knowledge that can be accessed at critical
moments of the sales process. Providing your sales reps with all of the material a

customer may require is a cornerstone of efficient sales enablement.


Paper manuals for the field or an online knowledge base that reps can refer
customers to are excellent examples of quality point-of-need information.


Knowledge Sharing:


Knowledge sharing involves encouraging your reps to learn from each other.
Meetings that encourage reps to express their victories, losses, and methods of
improvement are engaging and beneficial team-wide.


A strategic approach to sales product training will improve team-efficiency
immediately. It's a great investment that can (and should) be done in-house.
Product knowledge has the added benefit of making sales methodology and skill
training more relevant and effective.

                   Sales Methodology Training




Sales Methodology is the approach your team takes during the sales process. It
focuses on the systematic side of your sales activities; call preparation, sales
meeting format, improving overall sales effectiveness, finding high-quality leads,
and managing customer relationships.


Sales methodology training supports all of your sales efforts. It can bring massive

improvements to your sales process overnight if implemented effectively.


Sales methodology goes hand-in-hand with sales strategy. A good strategy
creates an environment for both your sales rep and customer that leads to closed
deals much more often.


Sales Methodology Training Strategies


There are a variety of methodologies designed for different aspects of the sales
process.


Studying each one individually is valuable, implementing the one that best fits
your business is ideal.


Conceptual Selling


Conceptual selling was developed by Miller Heiman of MHI Global. It focuses on
the idea that the consumer does not buy a product, they buy the results of that
product.


This is similar to focusing on the benefits of your product over the features it
contains. People are looking for a solution, understanding how you provide that
to them makes your product more appealing.


Conceptual selling uncovers the decision-making process of the customer
instead of leading with a pitch. Being customer-focused is an idea that occurs
often in sales training, and for good reason. Buyers have a lot of options,
understanding their needs and wants is essential to earning their loyalty.
Conceptual selling breaks the sale          down into 3 stages:




↑                                                                                  28
Getting information


Ask questions to determine the making decision-making process of your
customer.


    1. Who are they?
    2. What are the problems they’re facing?
    3. Why do they need your product?
This has the added benefit of qualifying your prospect. Questions like these
validate the buyer’s need for your product.


Giving Information


Giving information involves tailoring your solution to the needs of your prospect.
This stage is about connecting their problem to your solution.


    ● How your solution fits their concept
    ● How your solution is a better fit than competitive solutions
    ● The unique strength of your offer, custom-fit to your prospect's concept
The information you give should be only what your customer needs. Don’t waste
time by focusing on irrelevant details.


Getting commitment


Getting commitment from your prospect is extremely important. You want them to
commit to another interaction at the very least, and an agreement to purchase as
the relationship progresses.


    ● Get a commitment of further engagement after every interaction
    ● Get greater commitments as             the sales relationship progresses


↑                                                                                29
    ● If your customer refuses a commitment they are doubting your solution.
       Discover the reason behind their hesitation and provide more information
       on how your solution solves their specific problem
Your entire interaction with your customer should be based around their concept
of the solution they need. That means listening is more important than speaking.
If you can understand their problem you'll be the best fit for their solution.


SPIN Selling


Spin Selling is a sales model and book by Neil Rackham. He and his company,
Huthwaite, analyzed 35,000 sales calls to dissect the essentials of closing sales.


Rackham learned that asking questions was much more efficient than making
statements.


There were 4 types of commonly asked questions:


Situation questions:


Understanding buyer’s reasoning for purchase


Problem questions:


Involving the buyer's challenges and pain points. Keeps the conversation focused
on the need they have for what you're selling.


Implication questions:


Concerning the negative effects of the problem. These questions put the results
of the problem (and your solution)        at the forefront of the customer's mind.



↑                                                                                30
Need-Payoff questions:


What your solution does for the buyer. “How much money would this solution
save you a year?” Getting the buyer to explain the value of your product is more
effective than explaining it yourself.


The SPIN selling methodology focuses on problem-based questions to increase
the chance of success. Planning the exact questions you'll ask in advance is
even more effective.


Challenger Sales Approach


The Challenger Sale is an extremely popular sales book by Matt Dixson and
Brent Adamson. The Challenger model takes a different approach than others. It
suggests that customers are tired of answering questions and want more value
from their sales reps.


The challenger approach categorizes every sales rep as one of five types:


The Hard Worker: Persistent, interested in self-development


The Lone Wolf: Delivers results, difficult to manage


The Relationship Builder: Creates relationships, classic consultative rep


The Problem Solver: Detail-oriented, ensures all problems are solved


The Challenger: Loves to debate, pushes the customer. Strong understanding




↑                                                                              31
of the customer's business


The relationship builder, a classic methodology, was the least efficient model for
sales reps.


The Challenger model was the most successful in every study done. 40% of top-
performers use a challenger approach instead of the other four.


In complex sales, that number rises to 50%. Customers making complex
decisions appreciate a sales rep who understand their business and can simplify
the decision by being sure of their solution.

                             Sales Skill Training


Sales skill training increases the
efficiency of sales skills and
techniques. It covers the "how" of
sales, the nitty-gritty and personal
aspects of closing deals. Sales
skill training is typically in-person
and physical.


Sales skill training depends on
regular practice. The training program will generally provide a regimen for each
rep to follow designed to improve selling skills. Live coaching, practice calls, and
peer-review of technique are essential aspect of sales skill training.


The sales skills your team requires depends on your sales process. An inside
sales team should focus on tonality more than body language, for example.


That being said, there are fundamental sales skills that every salesperson should
know. These skills are basic aspects of communication and persuasion and
should be covered by any sales skill training program you invest in.




↑                                                                                33
  Sales Skill Training Fundamentals


  The most fundamental sales skills are also useful in everyday life. Suprise,
  communication and persuasion are daily activities. This section is written directly
  to your sales rep to help convey all of the different skills that go into sales.


  Conversation


  Conversation creates sales. Communication has been the basis of every sale
  since the dawn of time. How well the value of your solution is communicated
  decides if it’s sold or not. That’s not changing anytime soon.


  Conversational skill is a priority in any sales skill training program. Time
  magazine studied “The Art of Conversation” and found 5 fundamental rules:


      1. Put others at ease
      2. Put yourself at ease
      3. Weave in all parties
      4. Establish shared interests
      5. Actively pursue your own
In sales, the conversation is between you and your (potential) customer, which

creates a unique dynamic. Both of you are trying to get something from the

conversation. You want a sale and your customer wants a solution, both of you want

the best deal possible.

With that in mind, let’s look at the rules of conversation from a sales perspective:

   ● Put yourself at ease – Be calm, cool, and collected. If you seem nervous you’ll
       make your customer nervous.             Speak slowly and with intent to show



  ↑                                                                                  34
      confidence in the situation and your solution. The success of the conversation
      (and ultimately, the sale) is completely based on trust. By appearing at ease in
      the conversation you’re making your customer feel equally confident.
   ● Put others at ease – Make your buyer feel comfortable. Don’t control the
      conversation. Listen and make sure they understand they’re being heard. Their
      time is as valuable as yours, respecting their side of the conversation ensures
      they’ll respect yours.
   ● Weave in all parties – Don’t leave anyone out of the conversation. You can
      never be completely sure about who has influence in a group. Leaving a key
      decision maker out of the conversation, or ignoring their concerns, is a surefire
      way to lose the sale.
   ● Establish shared interests – Connect the conversation to the life of your buyer.
      They are looking for a solution to their specific problem. You can make your
      offering much more relevant by connecting it to their life. This also shows that
      you’re listening, and that you care about more than just the sale.
   ● Actively pursue your own – Don’t be afraid to actually sell. You aren’t doing
      anyone any favors by ignoring the purpose of the conversation. Balancing the
      sale with genuine interest in your customer will help you stand out as an
      excellent salesperson.


These rules help ensure that the sales conversation develops in a mutually beneficial
way for your rep and your buyer. Make your sales team memorize them and watch
the revenue flow. The following skills are based in conversational ability. Improving
them should be daily practice for your sales team.



Presentation

Presentation skills help you get your message across. You never know when you'll
need to present your product to one person or when a group will need a
demonstration.



 ↑                                                                                35
Present confidently with appropriate body language. Speak slowly to help your
audience absorb the information.


Your presentation (along with your sales pitch) should actively guide your
prospect into being a customer, not ignore them so that you can get your
message across.


Active Listening


Listening to your prospect is the most effective way of getting the sale. Active
listening involves hearing what your customer is saying while also understanding
what they mean.


The questions you ask your prospect should be based on the details they give
you. Your job, as a sales rep, is to weave together your prospect’s problems and
the solution you’re selling.


Storytelling


What better way to weave ideas together than storytelling? Salespeople must be
good storytellers. You need to communicate the value of your solution to your
customer’s life, telling a story to your prospect about how your product helped
someone just like them is the best way to do that.


Practice speaking with a narrative structure. Provide a setting, characters, and
conflict with a satisfying resolution (involving your product!) and you’ll capture
your prospects attention and close the sale.




↑                                                                                    36
Building Rapport


Rapport creates relationships. Relationships make sales. Your prospect needs to
like you, or at least tolerate you, before they'll buy from you.


Establishing rapport involves connecting with your prospect. Trade opinions,
share stories, and bond over common ground. Don’t rush into the sale while
ignoring that your prospect is a person, just like you.


Assertiveness


Being assertive doesn’t mean being rude. You can be assertive in a friendly, and
even passive, manner.


Direct the conversation towards the goal of the meeting. Both you and your
prospect know why you're meeting, there’s no shame in bringing the goal of the
meeting into focus at the appropriate time.


Conquering Objections


Overcoming objections is one of the most uncomfortable aspects of sales. You
have to disagree with someone, a scary idea for salespeople and non-reps alike.


It helps to understand that you’re not disagreeing with the person, only their idea.
If you’re sure that your solution will make their life better than you’re doing them a
favor by bringing them to your point of view. People are naturally unsure, it’s your
job to give them all of the facts they need to make a decision.




↑                                                                                 37
The basic process of overcoming objections is to:


Understand - “What’s preventing you from making a decision today?”


Empathize - “I understand why that might be an issue”


Overcome - “Will this fix ____? If not, what will?”


A good sales skill training program teaches your team to overcome common
objections in your industry. Specificity is key when addressing customer
concerns.


Closing


Closing a deal is getting a decision from your prospect, hopefully turning them
into a customer.


There are a variety of ways to improve close rate, but there’s one fundamental
thing you’ll need to do:


Ask with confidence - Consider asking for the sale mandatory. If you’ve used
your sales skills effectively your prospect will be ready to buy, if not, they would
have left already.


Still, a decision is a scary thing for prospects. By asking for the sale (with
confidence) you’re taking the pressure off of your customer and placing it on
yourself. This is usually appreciated and prevents any delay on the part of your
prospect.




↑                                                                                 38
Cross-Selling & Up-Selling


Cross-selling and up-selling are advanced skills. They involve selling to your
customer even more, either a related product or a more expensive version of
what they’re buying.


Getting more from each sale is a hallmark characteristic of a good salesperson.


Cross-selling involves selling related products that your customer can use in
addition to the one they've bought. A good way to introduce a cross-sale is to
connect the related product with another need of your customer.


Up-selling involves pitching a more expensive version of your product after your
prospect has decided to buy the regular version.


A good way to think about up-selling is that you’re giving your customer more
options. As long as you know they’ll value the upgraded version more than the
regular you’re doing them a favor by mentioning it.


Both cross-selling and up-selling require a deep understanding of your
customer's business. Before you ask them for a greater investment of time and
money, you need to know how that investment will benefit them.


Cross-selling and up-selling are both best for when a relationship has already
been established. That is, when you've already closed a sale with this customer.


Sales Skill Training Exercises


Sales skill training exercises can be performed in-house at very little cost. The
benefits of even informal sales            training more than justify the expense.


↑                                                                                39
Regular training will keep your sales team sharp and focused.


Here’s an overview of the types of exercises that will improve sales skills.


Create Call Plans:


Call plans are detailed descriptions of your customer, along with their goals,
challenges, and any questions you’d like to ask them.


Do this before every call. Compare notes with colleagues. Find the type of plan
that works best and make it standard.


Practice Questions:


Practice asking questions that get to the heart of your customer’s buying
decision.


Create a list of questions that find customer’s state, pain commitment, and
budget.


Practice Story Sharing


Story sharing is the process of sharing how your solution has helped others.
Putting the value of your solution into stories makes it relatable for the listener.


Stories are also excellent ways to pass along information. It’s easier to explain
the benefits of your offer by explaining how someone else has already benefitted




↑                                                                                  40
Practice Sales Calls & Conversation


This is a fun one. Partner with a team member and go over different sales
scenarios. Practice selling to different customer types in different situations, then
trade places. Throw your partner some curveball objections to see how well they
can recover.


Sales Skill Training Programs

skills. There are a variety of training programs catered toward different industries,
products, and styles.

leads in your industry and send them cold emails. It also offers Salesforce
integration so that new customers           can go straight into your CRM.

Salesloft offers three pricing structures: group, professional, and enterprise -
making it an appropriate solution for any-size company.

Growbots
Growbots works by scraping LinkedIn to find qualified leads in the industry you
want to target. Like Salesloft, you can cold email leads after you gather them.
Pricing starts at $500 per month, which is a justifiable expense for a small
company looking to grow.

Toofr
Toofr is helpful if you know the first name, last name, and company of your
prospect. All of this information can be found via LinkedIn, but the process can
be a burden on team operations. This is a great tool for individual sales reps
looking to make specific contacts. Pricing starts at just $29 per month, a
worthwhile investment for quality leads.

Zoominfo
Zoominfo is a service that supplies lists of employee email addresses from large
companies. This may be more appealing than lead generation software
depending on your needs.

Finding the right sales automation tool is a valuable process. A tool that is a good
fit for your team will greatly improve productivity.

Understanding the best strategies to use for sales automation training will help
speed up the learning process.

Best Strategies for Sales Automation Training

Pilot the tool
Let a couple of your more tech-savvy employees learn to love the tool before you
roll it out to your whole team. This way, your employees can learn from their
coworkers who they know and trust. Many software companies will offer free
trials, so have a couple of employees sign up and test the tool.

Let the company do it for you
There are many software                     companies that will offer demos in


↑                                                                                  48
either group or one-on-one once you sign up for the software. This is especially
true for startups where they will pay you the most attention because your
business is just as important to them as their software is to you.

Create Internal Training Materials

Regardless of the solution you use, create a best practices guide around it. This
can be distributed internally to cut down training time for new reps. Developing
internal training systems is the best way to optimize the learning process.

Sales Automation Training Courses
Training courses are a good investment if you’re looking to get your sales team
up-to-speed on a new tool quickly. The right course will cover basic and
advanced applications for your sales team, quickly turning your team into
experts.

1. How long have you been in sales? What industry?
I’ve been both a sales person and a sales trainer in many capacities over
the years. I started out as a kid selling my old toys and comic books from a
table in my front yard, then selling various products and services door-to-
door. As a young adult I sold cars, mutual funds, life insurance and
business services. Once I got into the field of Training & Development I
sold Earl Nightingale’s training materials and then my own. I started in this
field in 1974 and went full time on my own in 1977. My clients have been in
hundreds of industries and professions. I started in Financial Services:
Banking, Life Insurance and Investment Products.


2. What do you incorporate in your sales training? Can you describe
the process?
I’m the original author and champion of the concept known as “Relationship
Selling™”. I wrote the first book by that title and worked through the
resistance in the market when I first introduced the phrase. People used to
say, “Jim you have to choose; it’s either a relationship or a sale!”
My belief is that Relationships are either Assets or Liabilities depending on
how you manage them. In Relationship Selling™ we approach connections
as Assets and track and manage them accordingly.
In Sales Training topics must include: Sales Philosophy (What is selling
and why does it matter?), Sales Process, Sales Techniques, Self-
Management and Self-Motivation, Interpersonal Communication,
Understanding Buyer Differences: Values, Thinking Style, Personality
Type, Velocity differences, and cultivating Trust.


3. How does technology shape your sales process? What tools do
you use/recommend to use?
I don’t specify a particular approach to technology in sales because
companies and markets vary as to which is the best tool. Clearly we must
optimize our selling with the media, instruments and strategies that
generate the most trust and credibility as well as the best outcomes. Life is
much easier with the right technology.

4. What is the key component of your sales training?
Mindset. It shows up in each phase of the sale. I teach Relationship
Selling™ with a structure that I call “The Eight Competencies” structured
around the skill sets needed for each phase of selling: Preparation,
Targeting the right buyers, Connecting with them to gain trust, Assessing
their needs and wants, Solving their problem, Confirming their commitment
to buy, Assuring satisfaction and Managing Sales and Self.
I continually reinforce the Mindset that: Selling is an act of friendship, not a
process of simple persuasion. The purpose of Selling is: To Make Life
Better For The Buyer.


5. What are the best results you’ve seen from your sales training
process?
I spent 6 years working with a life insurance agency and they went from
nearly out of business to winning the President’s Trophy twice in a 5 year
period with a fifteen fold increase in production ($17 million to $231 million)
and a minimal increase in their sales force (19 agents).


6. What are the most important skills you can have as a sales trainer?
Self Awareness, Self Motivation and Self Management. If you can
understand and control yourself effectively then you will also understand
others better and be able to reach more of them. Self Motivation means
getting yourself to do what needs to be done even when you don’t feel like
it.


7. Why should companies invest in sales training?
Because if they don’t, they won’t make as many sales. If you don’t train
sales people then you cannot control your outcomes. It should be tracked
and “valued” constantly. If you can’t prove the value of the training then you
should switch to a different training program.


8. What was your most important learning experience?
When Doug Macdonald told me to stop selling and start helping. He said,




↑                                                                                  53
“Jim you know all the right words and you can manipulate people into
saying Yes but that’s not your job. Your job as a sales person is to help
them and earn a profit by doing so. When you cannot help someone then
you shouldn’t be selling to them. There are plenty of other prospects. Make
what you do count.


9. How do you connect with your team?
The question is too broad for me to provide a useful answer.
The way I connect with my clients is a combination of in person, by phone,
email, text, social media, webinars, podcasts, video training, executive
coaching, staff training, and providing some of my 17 books and other
recorded programs. I especially want everyone to get a copy of
Relationship Selling™ and The Self Motivation Handbook.


10. What advice would you give a new sales trainer?
Be sure you focus on Outcomes! Don’t get stuck in processes unless those
processes lead to desirable outcomes. It is the helping that matters, the
selling is just a way to get there. All sales people should get better each
month for their entire career. The way you know it’s working is that they
need you less and less in order to produce sales increases.

Bio: Barb Giamanco heads up Social Centered Selling. She’s the co-author of
The New Handshake: Sales Meets Social Media and authored the Harvard
Business Review article Tweet Me, Friend Me, Make Me Buy.




Known internationally as a thought
leader in Social Selling, Barb is a
sought after Sales and Social Media
Advisor and Speaker.

With successful C-level background
in Sales, Technology and
Leadership Development, Barb’s
experience speaks for itself. She
capped her corporate career at
Microsoft, where she led sales teams and coached executives. Through the
years she has sold $1B in sales.




1. How long have you been in sales? What industry?

25+ years. While still in corporate America, I sold for four tech companies with
the last being Microsoft. Now that I own my own business, I primarily sell
services into the technology and telecommunications markets.

2. What do you incorporate in your sales training? Can you describe the
process?

When we design programs, we start          by helping the customer create a


↑                                                                              55
strategy for what they want to accomplish. The actual training is done both
virtually and in-person, depending on the customers circumstances. For
example, if they have a large sales force spread out across the United States or
internationally, we often do virtual training that is recorded and broken down into
specific segments making it easier to digest. After every program, we also
incorporate ongoing coaching for 6-8 months and help the clients leadership
team carry that training reinforcement and training forward.

3. How does technology shape your sales process? What tools do you
use/recommend to use?

Our primary focus is helping salespeople integrate the use of social media into
their selling process. This is also known as social selling. Common platforms are
LinkedIn, Twitter, InsideView (business intelligence), Feedly, Paper.li and other
social channels that may be applicable for the customer.

4. What is the key component of your sales training?

The why and the how to integrate social selling strategies to attract and engage
buyers in new ways. The primary purpose is to improve prospecting and lead
generation results.

5. What are the best results you’ve seen from your sales training process?

The salespeople we’ve worked with (over 30,000) have seen results such as
expanded networks with the right line of business buyers and executives, an
increase in inbound sales inquiries, an increase in net/new sales meetings and
more.

6. What are the most important skills you can have as a sales trainer?

I’ve walked in the shoes of every salesperson and sales manager that we work
with. For that reason, I know what life as a seller is all about. I can relate to their
world and their challenges. Someone with no sales background will find that hard
to do. I’m also quite skilled in how to use technology and social channels
effectively to achieve specific sales results.




↑                                                                                  56
7. Why should companies invest in sales training?

Buyer expectations are higher than ever. What worked back in the day, is
outdated now. Buyers do not want the feature dump and your demo isn’t that
important (at least in the beginning). The Harvard Business Review reported that
more than 70% of executive buyers said that the ability for a salesperson to
demonstrate that they can solve business problems is key to their decision
making process. It is a new world and it is costly for a business to let their
salespeople figure it out as they go. They need to be training in how to be good
consultative sellers and that training should happen on an ongoing and
consistent basis. The problem is that often companies think of training as an
event and not a process, which is a big mistake.

8. What was your most important learning experience?

That learning never ends. Every day I make it my business to learn something
new. That keeps you relevant. No matter how much experience you have, you
never can know it all. Salespeople who think they already know it all are definitely
setting themselves up for failure. That is more true today than ever. With new
technologies popping up daily, salespeople have to keep up. And, because
buyers expect more than your dog and pony show, you need to keep your
communication, presentation, problem solving, consultative selling skills sharp.

9. How do you connect with your team?

We stay in touch using multiple methods – email, phone, Ryver for ideas
collaboration and document sharing and we use Office 365 to edit and update
our training documents. For large files that we need to send to customers, we
typically use Dropbox.

10. What advice would you give a new sales trainer?

Do your homework. Preparation is key. I spend time really getting to know the
company who hired me. Part of the upfront design of any training program we
deliver includes personally interviewing sales managers and salespeople to really
understand why a day in their life is like. We also do an anonymous survey to
learn as much as we can. It is also important to learn about the customers

you establish credibility.

1. How long have you been in sales? What industry?

Although my title is not sales, anyone whose job requires communication with
current and potential clients is in sales. In that regard, I have worked with over



↑                                                                                59
750 companies worldwide since 2002 as a member of the Human Resources
industry.

2. What do you incorporate in your sales assessment? Can you describe
the process?

Regarding the assessment process, the DriveTest® is taken online. Each
question uses a forced-choice format, designed to eliminate faking. For each
question, the candidate reviews three statements, all of which sound positive.

For example:
   - I consider myself a leader.
   - I have great relationship skills.
   - I am very organized.

The candidate must choose which of the statements is most like them and which
is least like them. This question format forces the candidate to make some very
difficult distinctions, but it gives us a much better sense of their real priorities.

3. How does technology shape your sales process? What tools do you
use/recommend to use?

Technology is critical to our sales process. Some of the tools we have found
most effective for managing relationships include Salesforce.com, iContact (for
managing our email list), and Formstack (for managing payment information).

4. What is the key component of your sales assessment?

The DriveTest’s key component is measuring the three non-teachable
characteristics our research have found to be critical for high-performing “hunter”
salespeople: Need for Achievement, Competitiveness, and Optimism, collectively
known as Drive. We also measure the more teachable core skills important for
just about every sales position, including Confidence, Persuasiveness, and
Relationship skills.

5. What are the best results you’ve seen from your sales
assessment/training process?



↑                                                                                60
The key benefit to expect from using the DriveTest is identifying higher-potential
sales candidates to move to the interview process, rather than spending time
with candidates who simply tell you what you want to hear. The DriveTest was
validated with salespeople in a variety of industries. Our research found that
those who were scoring a 4 or 5 on Drive (the highest levels), were almost twice
as likely to be identified as a sales leader by their manager than those scoring a
1 or 2.

6. What are the most important skills you can have as a sales trainer?

One of the most important skills for a sales trainer is targeting training to a
salesperson’s specific needs, rather than a “one size fits all” approach. After we
have identified each person’s unique training needs, listening is also critical to
understand his or her personal vision and goals. Finally, holding the salesperson
accountable with regular follow-up is essential.

7. Why should companies invest in sales assessment?

Unfortunately, many sales managers end up feeling burned by candidates who
talked a good game in the interview, but did not perform well thereafter, costing
hundreds of thousands of dollars in missed targets, lost customers, and
salary/benefits. Beyond the age of 21-22, we cannot increase Drive, which is the
easiest thing for a candidate to fake in the interview and the hardest thing to
accurately rate. Sales candidates can be especially skilled at figuring out what
you want to hear . . . and that may be the only sale you get out of them. Using a
well-constructed, validated assessment saves time and allows you to focus on
candidates who are much more likely to perform well for you.

8. What was your most important learning experience?

As discussed in our book, one of my most important learning experiences came
when we were first developing our Drive model over a decade ago. We had a
candidate who scored strong on both Need for Achievement and
Competitiveness who performed poorly attempting to sell a product new to his
market with a long sales cycle. As we learned, this type of product requires an
evangelist with unwavering Optimism. Unfortunately, this salesperson’s was



↑                                                                              61
pessimistic, and he had trouble overcoming objections. He parted ways with the
company after 6 months, offering to pay back every dollar of salary he received.
This caused us to research Optimism in depth, recognizing that without it, even a
highly motivated salesperson can lack the certainty and perseverance necessary
to succeed.

9. How do you connect with your team?

As mentioned above, the most important strategy for connecting with your team
is to get to know them as individuals, learning about each team member’s most
important personal aspirations and goals. Listen carefully to understand what is
most important to that person and provide them with resources (e.g. coaching,
books, training) tailored to their individual needs.

10. What advice would you give a new sales trainer?

Focus on developing skills that are teachable (e.g. persuasiveness, relationship
skills, time management), rather than trying to instill traits that we cannot teach,
such as Drive. Use assessments up front to determine each salesperson’s
innate level of Drive and their scores on the teachable skills, make sure they are
in a role that fits their level of Drive (i.e. Hunter vs. Farmer), and develop the
teachable skills thereafter.

1. How long have you been in sales? What industry?

43 years, and in multiple industries but the last 31 years in the sales consulting
industry.

process?

Sales Training is about creating a lasting change to the thinking, approach,
behavior, strategy, tactics, skills,        process, methodology and


↑                                                                               63
competencies required for sustained sales success. The process is to coach up
the sales management team so that they can provide skilled sales coaching to
their salespeople, in the context of the sales process and the content being
provided; We follow that up with a live one-day kick-off, bring the sales process
to life and demonstrate how to execute the process through role play. Then we
reinforce that with between 8-16 live, one-hour, online follow-up training sessions
to go wider and deeper on each of the milestones of the sales process with an
emphasis on role-playing.

3. How does technology shape your sales process? What tools do you
use/recommend to use?

The sales process must be integrated into the company’s CRM application. We
use and recommend Membrain.

4. What is the key component of your sales training?

The key component is the consultative approach to selling which requires active
listening and great questioning.

5. What are the best results you’ve seen from your sales training process?

While we’ve seen isolated incidents of great salespeople tripling their business,
it’s more typical to increase sales by somewhere between 30% - 100%.

6. What are the most important skills you can have as a sales trainer?

We must be able to engage our audience, keep them engaged and motivate
them to change. The training must entertain and motivate while sharing and
demonstrating the various required sales conversations through role-play.

7. Why should companies invest in sales training?

That’s the point. They should invest in training if they wish to improve sales
excellence and grow revenue and profit. They should spend money for sales
training if they are providing it for the sake of providing sales training. Invest for
change, spend to check it off the list out of obligation.

8. What was your most important learning experience?

Everyone is different and you can’t judge someone’s intentions or their eventual
decisions by looking at them or listening to them. While first impressions are
important, it’s more important to make sure that you make a good first impression
than it is that you develop a first impression of your prospect.

9. How do you connect with your team?

Daily huddles by phone, weekly live meetings.

10. What advice would you give a new sales trainer?

(1) Master the content so that when you deliver it you don’t have to think about it
and instead you can pay attention to the people you are training and their
reactions and responses to the material you are sharing.

(2) Live it – don’t teach anything that you haven’t actually done yourself –
successfully.

1. How long have you been in sales? What industry?
I have been in sales for about 30 years primarily in business services.

2. What do you incorporate in your sales training? Can you describe the
process?
Years ago I wrote a sales management and sales training program for a well-
known company so a lot of what we use comes from that. However, we
incorporate bits and pieces from       other sales methodologies including


↑                                                                               66
SPIN, Miller Heiman Blue-sheeting, Solution Selling and more recently tips from
Mike Weinberg’s “New Sales. Simplified.” The process includes about 50%
classroom and 50% roleplay.

3. How does technology shape your sales process? What tools do you
use/recommend to use?
We have our own proprietary solution built on SQL called PinPoint. It handles all
data capture and workflow (list segmentation, touch cycles, segmentation) plus is
the source for extensive reporting.

4. What is the key component of your sales training process?
The objective of each stage in the sales process. The opening – create interest.
Transition – give the call back to the prospect – let them feel they are in control.
Dialog – establish need. Close – satisfy the need.

5. What are the best results you’ve seen from your sales training process?
I love to see sales reps hit an “ah ha” moment – the moment when they can see
the process come together and they recognize that they can benefit from
following it.

6. What are the most important skills you can have as a sales trainer?
Empathy, confidence, pace, selflessness and of course, great communication
skills.

7. Why should companies invest in sales training?
When there is no process then it is like a football team sending everyone out for
a pass. It is likely that the QB is going to end up on the turf. Sales training should
provide the basis for more accurate forecasting and a common method for
evaluating results.

8. What was your most important learning experience?
You can’t put in what God left out.

9. How do you connect with your team?
Of course, face-to-face is best, but most of my contact is by telephone.

10. What advice would you give a new sales trainer?

Bio: “DISCOVER Questions® Get
You Connected” author, Top 50
Sales Influencer, UC-Berkeley
instructor. Deb leads the Stop
Selling & Start Leading movement
and offers sales training, coaching
and leadership development
programs. Deb is certified as an
executive and sales coach and is a
Certified Master of The Leadership
Challenge®. She has been training
sales trainers and coaches for more
than 15 years.


1. How long have you been in
sales? What industry?
I've been selling something all my life. Vegetables from the garden, door-to-door,
out of my little red wagon when I was 5... Camp Fire candy... and eventually
newspaper advertising where I worked for 18 years before starting my own
company People First Productivity Solutions where I now sell training and
coaching services.

2. What do you incorporate in your sales training? Can you describe the
process?
I believe that every sale starts with a connection. Our training focuses heavily on
interacting with buyers in ways that buyers prefer. We conduct ongoing research
with B2B buyers to remain relevant and current in our training. We also
customize our workshops by                  industry and company to ensure



↑                                                                               68
immediate application. This starts with us "practicing what we preach" by
surveying training participants and then delivering on their unique needs.

3. How does technology shape your sales process? What tools do you
use/recommend to use?
It depends on the audience. I offer "sales hacks" round-ups once a year and
incorporate those in training where it makes sense. In the UC-Berkeley sales
training course I teach, we have a high number of SDRs from start ups. They
tend to have very particular tech and tools needs that complement their own.

4. What is the key component of your sales training?
Connecting with buyers. DISCOVER Questions® Get You Connected reports on
the foundation of how to connect. The companion workbook is customized for
each group and gives participants their own blueprint for opening more sales and
advancing more sales more quickly. They can do this because we teach them to
respond the way buyers want sellers to.

5. What are the best results you’ve seen from your sales training process?
Increased sales! There are no other results that I'd celebrate unless there were
also measured increases in sales productivity. A recent story from a Client is the
kind that makes me smile -- a new hire went through our program and
immediately, in her first 3 months, outperformed all but two of the veteran sellers
on their team. Others in the course were in the top 10, too. This year, the
veterans were clamoring to get into the course, too.

6. What are the most important skills you can have as a sales trainer?
An ability and willingness to be oriented to others. Really, truly listening and
remembering and empathizing with participants makes a big difference in your
delivery. A lot of trainers get this backwards. They focus on their own delivery
and worry about saying the right thing, looking smart, being right, etc. They get
so caught up in the content or in their own presentation that they miss the needs
of the individuals in the training group. This can be learned, but it takes a certain
kind of humility and vulnerability to be this sort of sales trainer.

7. Why should companies invest in sales training?
Trick question! Not all companies should invest in sales training. The companies
who will benefit from sales training are the ones who:



↑                                                                                 69
- want their sellers to develop new skills and understand that will require
investing TIME and money for more than a workshop.
- have sales managers who will also attend training so they can reinforce the
skills and extend the learning.
- recognize that there's a difference between product training and training for
sales skills.
- are more interested in long-term success than in making this month's numbers.
- have other sales productivity systems in place and don't think sales training is
some kind of magic bullet.

For companies that are capable of handling it, they should invest in quality
training because it will improve top line revenue, retain and attract top sales
talent, improve customer satisfaction and protect their brand. I can't imagine why
any company would want untrained sellers haphazardly representing their brand
and hurting their image.

8. What was your most important learning experience?
I'm pretty hard-headed, so my most important learning experiences have usually
involved some kind of failure. Being called out for being a horrible Sales Manager
in my first job was humbling and made me really take stock of who I was and
how I was coming across to others. Fortunately, I was able to abandon my
stubbornness and try some new things. Being surrounded by really smart, caring
people helped me see alternatives and gave me the positive feedback I needed
to sustain that change.

9. How do you connect with your team?
Much of my team is scattered worldwide. We have 1-to-1 Skype meetings every
Sunday night to talk about work for the coming week. We stay in close
communication daily via email and rely heavily on Google Drive for collaborating.
We use Time Doctor, too, for tracking work projects. Communication is key

10. What advice would you give a new sales trainer?
Get trained as a sales trainer. Don't make the mistake so many do of thinking it's
about standing in front of room and telling entertaining stories about what worked
for you. Study instructional design, facilitation skills, adult learning principles,
coaching and listening. In my corporate Fortune 500 role, I trained new sales



↑                                                                               70
trainers in 12 markets. The ones who took this advice seriously and sought
professional credentialing and ongoing learning are the ones that have made the
biggest impact and enjoyed the most success in the ten years since then.

1. How long have you been in sales? What industry?

In sales professionally 20 years in the high tech sector, consulting for 19 years.

2. What do you incorporate in your sales training? Can you describe the
process?

We believe in deep discovery to building trust and confidence and fully
understanding the clients long term strategic objectives and then completing a
“Acumen Flightplan map” showing how the products/services meet those
objectives. It takes a lot of role play and case studies.

3. How does technology shape your sales process? What tools do you
use/recommend to use?

We believe is the use of interactive web sites for the prospect to use, making
your website a sales tool not just a marketing tool.

4. What is the key component of your sales training?

It has to be the focus on fully understanding the prospects customers; why do
people buy from the prospect? And knowing the industry issues your prospect
face. Most important is our Sales Management Training sessions where we
teach individuals how to recruit/hire, lead/manage and develop their teams.

5. What are the best results you’ve seen from your sales training process?

Huge adoption within industries or channels, our focus on selling within a channel
or independent distribution is huge.

6. What are the most important skills you can have as a sales trainer?

Keeping the training fun, interactive but also supportive.




↑                                                                                72
7. Why should companies invest in sales training?

We believe that the first investment is in Sales Management training to ensure
we have the right people hired and the internal systems are in place for success.
This will reduce the turnover factor and therefore reduce Cost of Sales.

8. What was your most important learning experience?

Understanding the emotional factor of sales vs pure skills building. People need
to have fun in selling and fully believe in the product/service, company and
impact of their sales on the prospects organization.

9. How do you connect with your team?

I build an emotional relationship that they know I am here to help them succeed,
with one on one coaching, follow up and personal awareness.

10. What advice would you give a new sales trainer?

Focus on an industry, know how your training can impact the salesperson’s life,
but also the industry they sell into.

1. How long have you been in sales? What industry?

Sales pedigree: I’ve spent almost 20 years in the business to business sales
industry. In that time I fulfilled a variety of sales functions at both the individual
contributor and sales manager levels including: Inside Sales | Direct Sales |
Channel Sales and CEO

Industry: IT Software


↑                                                                                    74
2. What do you incorporate in your sales training? Can you describe the
process?

The element which my company Trinity incorporates into our Sales training which
is unique, is direct and unfiltered feedback from customers and prospects. This
takes the guesswork out of the training process and ensures we’re focusing on
precisely those areas most in need of additional support.

The key failing with so much sales training is it tends to be generic and isn’t
tailored to the specific needs of the sales reps or sales teams who are
undertaking it. At Trinity, we spend a considerable amount of time talking directly
to end customers and key decision makers, asking them specific questions about
their interactions with your sales team and then we use these insights to guide
the focus of your sales training activities.

3. How does technology shape your sales process? What tools do you
use/recommend to use?

I believe that technology has some significant advantages and also some major
disadvantages.
    - It allows you to reach a broader or more geographically diverse group of
       people
    - It makes it easier to conduct embedding activities at the conclusion of a
       training process
    - It can allow students to consume content at their own pace or convenience

    -   The downside is that it often lacks immediacy, where students don’t get to
        interact in the same way with each other or the presenter
    -   It can make it harder to share relevant stories and anecdotes and answer
        questions which crop up along the way
    -   It’s not representative of the sales process and therefore often doesn’t
        allow people to practice real world skills (active listening, presenting,
        discovery & needs analysis) which they require in a day to day selling
        environment

I tend to use tools like Go-To Meeting & Go-To Webinar for one to many training



↑                                                                              75
activities. Skype is a useful tool for remote coaching and advisory meetings.
Tools like Survey Monkey can be useful for conducting research or surveys and
tools like Mail Chimp for communicating regularly with students, after a course
has concluded.

4. What is the key component of your sales training?

Real world sales lessons:

In many experience, way too much sales training is theoretical in its approach. It
doesn’t reflect the commercial or interpersonal situations which salespeople find
themselves in on a daily basis. All of our Sales Training is based in the real world
of B2B sales and we don’t shirk the difficult topics or the tough conversations.

Ultimately I see my role as preparing our students for any sales eventuality that
may occur and giving them the tools and knowledge to confidently overcome the
challenges that are thrown at them. By harnessing the power of real Customer
feedback, in some ways our students gain an ‘unfair advantage’ over their
competitors.

5. What are the best results you’ve seen from your sales training process?

I always look at 2 key sets of metrics, to determine success:

    1. Hard metrics such as increase deal conversion rates and deal values.
       Improved competitive win rates, earlier decisions to qualify out of
       opportunities, reducing the cost of sale and opportunity costs.
    2. Softer metrics include lower sales rep turnover, a higher number of reps
       attaining quota, higher levels of customer satisfaction, greater numbers of
       referrals and customer case studies.

6. What are the most important skills you can have as a sales trainer?

I think first and foremost you need to have spent time in the trenches. If you
haven’t carried a sales quota, conducted forecast calls, managed sales people,
interacted with customers on a daily basis, then what you are presenting is only
theory to you and that doesn’t fill most sales training groups with much



↑                                                                               76
confidence.

In addition to time in the trenches, I think it’s important to be a strong
communicator, a great listener, humble enough to learn and be challenged along
the way. A sense of humour and a thick skin are two quite important traits to
have also!

7. Why should companies invest in sales training?

The key word in this question is ‘invest’. So often sales training is seen either as
a necessary evil or as something to do because we have some sales enablement
budget. The reality is the best sales training is an investment, not just in the
growth of your team, but in the likelihood that they will continue to meet or
exceed the targets which you have set for them.

The world of B2B sales is rapidly evolving, as the balance of power shifts from
vendors to customers. Those vendors who invest wisely in the right type of
training and development for their sales teams, will ensure they remain relevant
and value adding to the customers they serve.

8. What was your most important learning experience?

Learning the expression “I don’t know, but I’ll find out for you”. As a young sales
professional, I didn’t want to display my ignorance, so instead I would try to come
up with an answer to any and every question. Eventually I learned that no-one
expects you to know everything, they are just as happy if you go away and find
the right answer and then come back to them.

Also learning the importance of strong qualification and discovery conversations
early in my interactions with any new customer/prospect was an important
lesson.

9. How do you connect with your team?

Our team is made up of full time employees, contractors and freelancers, so we
use a variety of mechanisms to stay in regular contact, including phone, email,
skype, dropbox and face to face catch-ups. Over communicating with people is



↑                                                                               77
important early on, until both parties develop a comfortable working rhythm.

10. What advice would you give a new sales trainer?

Don’t feel the need to know everything. There is usually a huge amount of
knowledge, experience and war stories within any group you are training, so tap
into that.
Don’t leave your personality in the chair when you stand up to present. People
will respond to you much more, if you are authentic, honest and engaging.

1. How long have you been in sales? What industry?

I had my own company for close to 40 years selling advertising to small
businesses. I retired almost 7 years ago and wrote a book called Selling
Fearlessly, which has done very well. The book led to a website,
www.sellingfearlessly.com, which led to people calling me from all over the world
seeking help. I’ve done some professional coaching as well, although I didn’t
want to do it at first. But it turned out I actually enjoy it, so I continued to train
people in sales and try to help as              many as I can.

2. What do you incorporate in your sales training? Can you describe the
process?

It’s so individual that it’s hard to describe a general process. It really depends on
who the person is and what he or she is seeking. For example, I was working
with a client who was sending out Emails to get business and he was giving too
much information in those Emails. So I advised him to use the telephone, as well
as limit the amount of information he was giving. He needed to interest them
instead of trying to give a presentation in an Email. His mind just opened up to
this and he realized what he’d been doing was wrong. So he changed it and
started to get business left and right. It really depends on the individual and what
he or she needs.

3. What is the key component in your sales training?

In the book, I wrote about the sales triangle, which is also the key component of
every sales training. I teach salespeople the 3 sides of the triangle, which they
need to internalize, in order to be successful.

The first side of the sales triangle is mental attitude. As a salesperson, you have
to have a strong mental attitude and can’t approach people from a position of
subservience. You need to believe in what you’re doing and you have to know
that you’re bringing value to the people.

The second side of the triangle is work habits. You just need to do the work and
work hard. Give 8 to 12 presentations a week instead of just 4. You can’t get
away from not doing the work if you want to be successful.

The third side of the triangle is knowledge/salesmanship. You have to know sales
backwards, forwards and sideways. You must know your own business and
every aspect of it. You also have to know your competition, so you can outsell
them and bring more value than they can.

4. What are the best results you’ve seen from your sales training process?

One client I was working with was running into the same objection 8 times out of



↑                                                                                80
10 calls. So, I told him that the best way to overcome this objection is by making
it part of the presentation and in this way neutralize it. Bring it up instead of
waiting for the client to bring it up. Once he implemented this, he created an
enormous sale from it and became much more successful. It’s wonderful to get
feedback like this.

5. What are the most important skills you can have as a sales trainer?

You also need to internalize the three sides of the triangle I mentioned earlier:
have a strong mental attitude, work hard and be knowledgeable so you can bring
value to your clients.

Besides, you have to be able to approach people from a position of equality
because this is what gets people to respect you and do business with you. You
must demand that respect by being knowledgeable, by putting them first and by
making it your mission to bring them value.

6. Why should companies invest in sales training?

I was working with a women who had been hired by a company that just sent her
out there without any training. So she wasn’t successful and got frustrated. It’s
obvious to me that you need to train your salespeople in order to be successful. If
a company isn’t smart enough to provide sales training, sales people should get
training on their own. It’s worth it for a company to pay for it because sales
trainers can perform miracles. Sometimes companies are already very
successful and don’t think they need the training, but they don’t realize how much
more successful they could be if they invested in it.

7. What was your most important learning experience?

The most important learning experience is the sales triangle I mentioned above,
the 3 attributes you need to be successful. But also, you need to believe in the
product you’re selling because your job isn’t to sell people, it’s to bring value to
them. If you bring them great value, the selling will come naturally.

8. What advice would you give to salespeople as a Trainer?




↑                                                                                81
Sell value and care about the customer instead of focusing on your numbers. Put
the customer first, understand their problems and help them find the best solution
to it. Also, be knowledgeable, educate yourself with all the content and books
that are out there, so you can educate your customers. Never stop learning.

                                        Business School. His book, Aligning
                                        Strategy and Sales: The Choices,
                                        Systems, and Behaviors that Drive
                                        Effective Selling (Harvard Business
                                        Review Press) has been called “the best
                                        sales book of the year” (Strategy +
                                        Business), “a must read” (Gartner Group),
                                        and “perhaps the best sales book ever”
                                        (Forbes).




                                        1.How did you get interested in the
                                        topic of sales?

                                           My academic research always focused on
                                           go-to-market elements of business,
                                           including channels and sales
                                           management. Then, when I left academia
and ran a business for 12 years, I had to meet payroll and sell. Then, after
getting lucky in business and returning to academia, I taught Strategy and found
there is remarkably little research about how to link strategy with field execution
and especially with sales efforts. Yet, U.S. companies alone spend about $900
billion annually on sales efforts. That’s 3x what they spend on ALL ad media,
more than 10x what they spend on all digital media, and more than 20x what they
spend on social media. Selling is, by far, the most expensive part of strategy
execution for most companies.

2. As you see it, why should              companies invest in sales training?


↑                                                                              82
Someone once told me that many companies maintain their equipment better
than their people. If so, they ultimately get what they don’t maintain. This is
especially risky and short-sighted in sales. Research indicates that, across
industries, turnover in sales averages about 25-30% annually. This means that,
at many firms, the equivalent of the entire sales force must be replaced and
trained every four years or so. Any talk about “talent management” which ignores
a talent requirement of that magnitude is just talk.

Despite what you often read in many blogs these days, selling is not a science
reducible to a few timeless rules. Many variables affect market performance and
selling effectiveness besides the sales person. But as the phrase implies, “sales
reps” represent the organization and its capabilities to the market. They need
reinforcement, periodic upgrading and adaptation of skills to new market
circumstances, and the positive motivation that is a by-product of any good
developmental process. Stated more bluntly, you must invest in training
salespeople (and other professionals who deal with a range of changing
situations) because of what the U.S. Air Force calls the “8 P’s” in its training of
pilots: “Proper Prior Planning and Preparation Prevents Piss-Poor Performance.”

3. What are the key components of effective sales training?

Build Your Team, Not another Firm’s Team. There is no such thing as effective
selling if it’s not linked to your firm’s strategy and business objectives. So first
focus on identifying the selling behaviors required by that strategy and the target
customers inherent in those strategic choices.

Develop the Fundamentals. Train and develop salespeople in a consistent and
measurable way with attention to actual behaviors (not only attitudes) that can be
practiced and taught, not just preached.

Do Experiential Learning. Selling is a performance art. Acquiring behavioral skills
(versus concepts) requires repetition. People must try a new behavior multiple
times before it becomes comfortable and effective. This means that on-the-job
learning is crucial. But in many organizations, “on-the-job” training is a
euphemism for no real training at all. It’s a random process dependent on a
particular sales manager’s calendar, temperament, and ability. That’s a mistake.



↑                                                                                83
Given the amount of money spent on sales by companies (an average of 10% of
revenue across industries, and often more in B2B companies), senior executives
have a responsibility to manage and measure that investment more rigorously.

Follow-Up. The greatest impact from training, according to many studies, is what
happens after training sessions: follow-up aimed at ensuring that people apply
the relevant behaviors. Too often, however, nothing happens after training
initiatives. Effective sales training must be linked to subsequent performance
reviews, ride-alongs, win-loss analyses, and other core performance
management practices.

4. How is technology shaping sales processes and training requirements
and goals?

First, let’s be clear about what technology is NOT doing: it’s not
disintermediating, or replacing, sales people with ecommerce. According to U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of people in sales occupations in 2015
was the same as in 1992—before the commercialization of the internet. And this
almost certainly understates the real numbers: in an increasingly service
economy, business developers in more firms are called Associates, Partners,
Managing Directors, or Vice Presidents, not listed in a “sales” category for
reporting purposes.

But technology is realigning sales tasks as buyers conduct online research about
products and prices before meeting with a salesperson. As a result, there is more
pressure for salespeople to add value during the customer encounter and, due to
online technologies, customers can more easily interact with other customers
and with others at the selling company besides the sales person. Sales training
must focus more precisely on key tasks so that reps are more than walking-and-
talking direct-mail vehicles and, in many companies, sales training needs more
emphasis on how other functions in the firm affect, and are affected by, selling
behaviors.

Also, digital technologies are available to sellers, with positive training
implications if companies use the tools properly. Badger, Showpad, and many
other sales enablement providers are just the tip of what is increasingly available
to firms for better, more customized, and real-time training and performance



↑                                                                               84
improvement in sales.

5. What advice would you give to a new sales trainer?

Focus on Buying Behavior. Selling is always more about the buyer than the
seller. What’s important in sales training should be determined by up-to-date
knowledge about who buys, why, and how. Training should reflect how buying,
and therefore required sales tasks, work today and tomorrow, not yesterday.

Beware of One-Size-Fits-All Methodologies. Selling is the most contextually
determined set of skills in a firm: what works at that company does not
necessarily work here, because sales effectiveness is a function of a company’s
strategy, target customers, and the relevant sales tasks for those buyers.
Sometimes an off-the-shelf training tool can address the desired outcome. But
more often, customization is required.

Get Out There, Regularly. It’s not the market’s responsibility to be nice to your
company’s strategy and sales process. It’s your responsibility to understand the
changing market and adapt. You must stay in on-going touch with actual
customers. As Sam Walton repeatedly told his leadership team, “There ain’t
many customers at headquarters.”

1. How long have you been in sales? What industry?
I have been in sales ever since I was a little girl, helping my grandmother with
rummage sales and craft shows throughout my whole life since I could talk really.
As for corporate America, I have 23 years of sales experience under my belt. I
have been in many industries throughout the years ranging from my first job as a
cashier at McDonald’s “would you like fries with that”, to selling commercial office
furniture, window treatments, and landing myself into the medical equipment field
currently.

2. What do you incorporate in your sales training? Can you describe the
process?
All sales positions I have held have always included sales training developed and
presented by that entity. Typically speaking classroom style lecturing and a small



↑                                                                               86
amount of group activities. However, as a sales trainer myself for my company, I
believe a more hands on approach is more desired. I will have the new employee
job shadow me for 2 days in the field showing them “how” the job is truly done.
Then, I will spend 2 days in their area watching how they interact and speak and
critique as needed. After my training with my new employees I stay closely
connected to them reaching out periodically, asking how things are going, telling
them tips and tricks I have picked up in the field and so forth.

3. How does technology shape your sales process? What tools do you
use?
Technology has made MY approach in my sales process key. I typically rely
solely on my mobile device. I use it mostly by making phone calls, texting, and
sometimes have certain apps I lean on for support if I am uncertain of an answer.
I also do carry a laptop with me at all times, but find I typically do not use it as I
am unable to connect to wifi.

4. How do you separate managing and training?
Luckily for me I am an Account Executive as well as trainer, so I am only
responsible for managing myself.

5. What are the best results you’ve seen from your sales training process?
When able to say, show, and help guide that will always show the best results.

6. What are the most important skills you can have as a sales trainer?
Listening, Self Confidence, great at motivating others, giving beneficial feedback,
coaching, superior customer service, selling customer needs, presentation and
speaking skills, natural leader, works great under pressure, self-starter, sense of
ownership, excellent creative and conceptual thinking abilities, incredible work
ethic, and I am not afraid of rejection.

7. Why should companies invest in sales training?
Any company can have a sellable product, but at the end of the day it is who is
selling the product that typically decides whether or not the prospect becomes a
customer. If companies see value and make the investment into properly and
effectively training their sales team, everyone wins.

8. What was your most important learning experience?



↑                                                                                 87
This is a difficult question to answer, my most important learning experience
probably has been realizing that I have to rely on myself and no one else. I can
have all the training manuals at my fingertips but if I do not push myself no one
can.

9. How do you connect with your team?
When meeting with my team I will make it interactive, making everyone feel and
become part of my team. I tend to talk through challenges with my team to create
solutions together instead of deciding to run with my sole idea on my own.

10. What advice would you give a new sales trainer?
The biggest advice I would recommend is knowing that, you the trainer, know
more than your students. Preparation is key, however, you will probably forget
something along the way and instead of noting the mistake continue with your
presentation and include the missing information at a different time. The students
do not know how you plan to present or in what order.

Sales automation training is very dependent on the needs of the company. The
size, industry, and budget of the company are all factors when deciding which
software to use for the business. Any sales automation software will pay for itself
if used correctly.
