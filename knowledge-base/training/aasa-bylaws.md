develops to the maximum the potential of individuals is a fundamental right of citizenship in our

instruments in fulfilling this right. It believes that the quality of administration of the schools has an
overriding effect on the ability of the schools to deliver the required programs.

and public interest in improved schools; to work particularly for improvement to the process of
educational administration; to improve the preparatory and in-service training of educational
personnel; to strive continuously to upgrade teaching and learning and to improve the curriculum; to
implement the principle of equal rights for all, including the elimination of prejudice, bigotry, and
discrimination; to assist in solving problems of organization and planning which arise as the school
systems are improved; and generally to do all other things appropriate to achievement of its
educational and charitable objectives.

The activities in furtherance of these objectives shall be limited to those consistent with the historic

company that sells products or services to schools. A candidate cannot be a retiree; however, he or
she could continue to serve, if retirement commenced during his or her term of office as a regional
executive committee member, as long as she or he is not an employee or representative of a company

from that region, notwithstanding other provisions of these bylaws.

If a vacancy occurs in the position of regional Executive Committee member, including a vacancy
created by a regional executive committee member moving out of the region (resulting in the
automatic resignation of his or her position), the region shall conduct a special election to select a
new regional Executive Committee member, as soon as practical, to complete the unexpired term.

If an Executive Committee member misses two meetings without a legitimate excuse, he or she can
be removed from their position. Legitimate excuses are illness or emergency situations of either a
personal or professional nature. Once someone has missed two meetings without a legitimate excuse,
a letter will go out from the President to the Executive Committee member that they will be removed
from their position, followed by notification to the Executive Committee, Governing Board members
within the region, and the state executives within the region.

SECTION 5        Prior to assuming the position of President-elect on July 1, the President-elect shall
