Coaching and mentoring ensure the continual and faster transfer of

supervisors and those who teach and guide their people in performing their
jobs with effective coaching and mentoring skills.

and S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound)
models or processes for planning, goal setting and problem solving, how to
develop trust among employees, the effective way of monitoring and giving
feedback and much more.
This comprehensive training course is now available across the U.S., including
Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Birmingham, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas,
Houston, Jackson, Los Angeles, Manhattan, Miami, Orlando, New York,
Philadelphia, San Antonio and Seattle.




What You’ll Gain:
In today’s environment of changing technology and evolving organizations, coaching can
create a strong competitive advantage. It provides continuous learning and develops people
to meet current and future needs. Business mentoring and coaching is an investment that
you make in developing your key resource people for the long-term benefit of the
organization.
About 6 out of 10 (59%) organizations currently offer coaching or other developmental
counseling to their managers and executives, according to a nationwide survey of more than
300 companies conducted by Manchester, a human capital consulting firm. Another 20% of
organizations said they plan to offer such coaching within the next year.
Productivity happens when managers can develop strong relationships with their employees.
Executive coaching builds the capability of managers to help their employees with the
intangible elements of human relationships. This Coaching and Mentoring Training program
will help you turn performance management into a collaborative process that benefits
everyone.
