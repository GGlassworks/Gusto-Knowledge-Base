Code of Ethics


AASA's Statement of Ethics for Educational Leaders

An educational leader’s professional conduct must conform to an ethical code of
behavior, and the code must set high standards for all educational leaders. The
educational leader provides professional leadership across the district and also across
the community. This responsibility requires the leader to maintain standards of
exemplary professional conduct while recognizing that his or her actions will be
viewed and appraised by the community, professional associates and students.

The educational leader acknowledges that he or she serves the schools and
community by providing equal educational opportunities to each and every child. The
work of the leader must emphasize accountability and results, increased student
achievement, and high expectations for each and every student.

To these ends, the educational leader subscribes to the following statements of
standards.

The educational leader:
   1. Makes the education and well-being of students the fundamental value of all
      decision making
   2. Fulfills all professional duties with honesty and integrity and always acts in a
      trustworthy and responsible manner.
   3. Supports the principle of due process and protects the civil and human rights
      of all individuals.
   4. Implements local, state and national laws.
   5. Advises the school board and implements the board's policies and
      administrative rules and regulations.
   6. Pursues appropriate measures to correct those laws, policies, and regulations
      that are not consistent with sound educational goals or that are not in the
      best interest of children.
   7. Avoids using his/her position for personal gain through political, social,
      religious, economic or other influences.
   8. Accepts academic degrees or professional certification only from accredited
      institutions.
   9. Maintains the standards and seeks to improve the effectiveness of the
      profession through research and continuing professional development.
   10. Honors all contracts until fulfillment, release or dissolution mutually agreed
       upon by all parties.
