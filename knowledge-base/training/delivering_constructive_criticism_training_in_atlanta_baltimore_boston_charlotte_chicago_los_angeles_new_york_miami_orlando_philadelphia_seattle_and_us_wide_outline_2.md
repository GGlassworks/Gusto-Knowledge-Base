and deliver constructive criticism that will motivate the recipient to cooperate
and work to achieve the desired improvement.
The Delivering Constructive Criticism Training course teaches you: how to
determine the right place, time and occasion for giving criticism, planning and
preparing the constructive criticism, how to control emotions and outbursts,
body language and its effect on the delivery of constructive criticism, how to
measure results and much more.

What You’ll Gain:
Constructive Criticism must be provided correctly to maximize its impact and benefits.
During this training course in delivering constructive criticism, participants receive training in
choosing the right place, time and occasion for giving criticism; setting goals; preparing and
planning a healthy criticism; and understanding the role of emotions and reactions in
delivering constructive criticism.
Effective criticism helps in the management of human resources. It reduces/eliminates
problematic behaviors and conflicts that negatively impact an organization. When an
employee commits an action that requires feedback or criticism, it needs to be handled
skillfully.
