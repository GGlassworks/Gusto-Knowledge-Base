What You’ll Gain:
Research and conventional wisdom both suggest that employees get about 90 days to prove
themselves in a new job. Every organization has its own version of the complex process new
employees go through to learn skills, knowledge, attitudes and behaviors required to
function effectively. The bottom line is, the faster the new employees feel welcome and
prepared for their jobs, the faster they will be able to successfully contribute to the firm’s
strategic and operational plans.
