                  SALARY & BENEFITS STUDY

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The 2021–22 AASA Superintendent Salary & Benefits Study marks the ninth consecutive edition of
this study. The 2021–2022 version employed a slightly revised and updated survey instrument. The
survey tracks the demographics, salary, benefits, and other elements of the employment agreements
of school superintendents throughout the country.

This year’s study results are based on 1,776 complete responses—an increase of 258 over the previous
year. The survey was distributed online and relied on superintendents responding to 69 items with the
understanding that the report of findings would contain no personally identifiable information.
Therefore, readers must consider the data descriptive and not necessarily representative of all
superintendents. The study is intended to provide superintendents with actionable information needed
to negotiate and manage their compensation and benefits.

Prior to the AASA efforts to study this topic, most school superintendents relied on the annual salary
study sponsored by the Education Research Service (ERS) to benchmark their compensation and
benefits. The closure of ERS nearly a decade ago created a void in data about superintendent salary
and benefits.

AASA responded to the need for data by developing a comprehensive study of the salary and benefits
of school superintendents that far exceeded previous studies undertaken on this topic. AASA is
particularly well suited for this task because it represents the vast majority of school superintendents
in the country and has been most active in collecting and disseminating to its members critical data
needed to inform superintendent decision making about a host of topics.

AASA is committed to refining this work over time, thus maximizing the benefit to superintendents.
The earlier editions of this study are available on the AASA website and provide valuable retrospective
data (http://www.aasa.org/research.aspx).

This work complements The American School Superintendent: 2020 Decennial Study edited by Professor
Christopher H. Tienken, the AASA Research Professor in Residence and Associate Professor of
Education Leadership, Management, and Policy from Seton Hall University, sponsored by AASA in
conjunction with Phi Delta Kappa. The official press release for the 2020 Decennial Study can found

METHODOLOGY

The research team was comprised of Tara Thomas, AASA legislative analyst; Dr. Christopher H.
Tienken, AASA Research Professor in Residence and Associate Professor of Education Leadership,
Management, and Policy; Li Kang, doctoral graduate assistant, Seton Hall University; and Dr. George
J. Petersen, Professor and Founding Dean of the College of Education at Clemson University.
Assistance was also provided by Dr. Robert S. McCord, AASA research consultant. The research was
conducted under the direct supervision of Noelle Ellerson Ng, AASA Associate Executive Director,
Policy and Advocacy.

An extensive survey instrument was originally developed in 2012 with the assistance of Professors
Theodore J. Kowalski (University of Dayton), I. Phillip Young (University of South Carolina), Terry
Orr (Bank Street College), and Christopher C. Stream (University of Nevada, Las Vegas). The survey
instrument was revised in July, August, and September 2021 by the research team for the current
edition of the study. The research team sent the revised instrument for peer review by nine
superintendents:
    • Dr. Sharon L. Contreras, Superintendent, Guilford County Schools, Greensboro, NC.
    • Dr. Burke Royster, Superintendent, Greenville County Schools, Greenville, SC.
    • Dr. Lee D’Andrea, Superintendent (Retired), Anderson School District Four and Pickens
        County School District, SC.
    • Dr. Holly Edds, Superintendent, Orcutt Union School District, Orcutt, CA.
    • Dr. Anne Hubbard, Superintendent, Hope Elementary School District, Santa Barbara, CA.
    • Mrs. Susan Salucci, Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources, Orcutt Union School
        District, Orcutt, CA.
    • Dr. Gregory C. Hutchings, Jr., Superintendent, Alexandria City Public Schools, Alexandria,
        VA.
    • Dr. Michael Lubelfeld, Superintendent of Schools, North Shore School District 112, Highland
        Park, IL.
    • Dr. Angelica M. Ramsey, Superintendent of Schools, Midland Independent School District,
        Midland, TX.

Additional questions were added (n=5), and further revisions were made to the survey instrument for
clarity and to aid readability based on the feedback from the peer review.

Using a commercially prepared mailing list of American public school superintendents, 6,974 email
invitations to participate were distributed during the months of October and November 2021. State
association executive directors were contacted to encourage their members to respond to the online
survey.

REPORT OF FINDINGS

This report of findings is divided into 11 sections with 101 tables, and relies solely on measures of
central tendency for this analysis of the data collected. In some cases, the data are generally
disaggregated by gender, district enrollment, and racial/cultural group.



                                                                                                   2
As noted in previous reports, there are limitations on the proper use of the data:
    • When the responses for certain items are disaggregated by racial/cultural group, the number
       of responses may be insufficient to support decision making.
    • Care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences on this data element.
    • In addition, some survey fatigue is commonly reported by superintendents and could have
       impacted the return rate, although it should be noted that the number of valid responses
       exceeded the 2020–2021 study by 258+ and this study had the highest number of completed
       surveys since at least 2012.

After each data display in the report, authors offer general statements of findings. It is the intent of
the authors to allow the readers the opportunity to disaggregate the data in a manner they find useful
in working with their board of education.

There were 1,785 responses to the survey. After carefully checking the data, responses from nine
participants were omitted as the research team found them to be invalid because of issues related to
missing salary and other entries. The final sample size was 1,776. The nine omitted participant
responses equated to 0.5% of the total responses; 99.5% of the total responses were retained.

Readers will note that respondents omitted responses to some questions. Therefore, the n-value will
be less than 1,776 in some cases. The questions with the highest percentages of omitted responses
centered on salary information for assistant/associate/deputy superintendent (n=858, 48%), middle
school principal (n=417, 23%), and race/ethnicity (n=44, 2.5%).

The highest percentage of omitted data occurred for the assistant/associate/deputy superintendent
(48%%). Some school districts do not have such a position because of enrollment size or budget
constraints. The second largest amount of data omitted by respondents was salary figures for middle
school principals (23%). Again, this could be due to the configuration of some school districts, such
as grades PreK–8 or PreK–6. In addition, some percentages in the tables presented may total between
99.4% and 100.3% due to rounding.

Having clearly identified the limitations inherent in a study of this magnitude, the report that follows
is replete with important information that can prove very useful to superintendents.

*** Care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences from the very small numbers of
respondents in some of the racial/cultural groups, other than the fact that White (not Hispanic)
superintendents are the largest group represented in the study. Other racial/cultural groups appear to be
underrepresented in the superintendent ranks, especially when compared to the racial/cultural profile of
American public-school enrollment.

Findings: Where sufficient numbers exist, there are differences by race/cultural group and
enrollment. There are larger percentages of superintendents who identify as White in districts with
enrollments ranging from fewer than 300 students to 2,999 students, whereas districts with 3,000–
24,999 students are led by higher percentages of superintendents identifying as Black or African
American and Hispanic or Latino.

Findings: Almost half—46%—of respondents have five years or less experience as a superintendent.
Where numbers were sufficient, there was little difference in most cases based on race/cultural group
and years of experience. However, differences were noted for superintendents with 11–15 years of
experience. In this category, there were higher percentages of superintendents who identified as White
(13.83%) and Hispanic or Latino (11.84%) compared to those who identified as Black or African
American (5.66%).

Findings: The findings for this year’s investigation suggest that a smaller percentage (26.8%) of
superintendents believe their districts are in declining economic conditions compared to the 2020–21
report in which 35.5% of superintendents described their districts as having declining economic. Less
than 20% believe their districts are currently in growing economic conditions.

Findings: Where numbers are sufficient, differences exist by race/cultural group. Higher percentages
of superintendents who identify as Black or African American (61.8%) hold an EdD compared to
those who identify as White (42.3%). Conversely, only 13.2% of superintendents who identify as Black
or African American hold a master’s degree compared to 38.9% of superintendents who identify as
White.

Note: As indicated in the introduction, care should be exercised in drawing conclusions or inferences
from the very small numbers of respondents in some of the racial/cultural groups, other than the fact
that White (not Hispanic) superintendents are the largest group represented in the study. Other
racial/cultural groups appear to be underrepresented in the superintendent ranks, especially when
compared to the racial/cultural profile of American public-school enrollment.

Findings: Consistent with previous years, salaries increase as district enrollment increases. It should
be noted that sample sizes for enrollments beyond 49,999 were small and not useful for statistical
purposes. The overall median salary for the entire sample was $147,000 and the mean was $158,670.

Findings: When base salary is considered by racial/cultural group, some variation is noted, although
the small number of respondents in some groups makes definitive analysis difficult, if not
inappropriate.

Findings: Consistent with findings in previous editions of the study, the larger the student enrollment
of the district, the higher the mean base salary for assistant/associate superintendents when sample
sizes exceed ten responses. It is noted that in districts with lower enrollments, these positions often
do not exist. A modest but consistent increase in median salaries is seen over previous editions of this
study.

Findings: Similar to their high school counterparts, middle school principal base median salaries are
loosely related to district enrollment and generally increase as district enrollment increases.

Findings: Elementary school principals generally follow the same trend as their high school and
middle school counterparts; median salary increases as enrollment increases. In addition, for the third
year in a row, their 2021 median base salary in districts with enrollments of 10,000 or more has crossed
the $100,000 line.

Findings: There appears to be a slight relationship between district enrollment and beginning teacher
salary. Where there are a sufficient number of responses, the highest median base salaries appear to
be found in districts with 5,000–9,999 students.

*= sample size less than 40
Findings: A metric of importance in the private sector is the ratio of the entry level worker
compensation with the base salary (without incentives) of the CEO. The median entry-level base salary
of teachers is presented compared with the median base salary of superintendents arrayed by district
size for 2021–2022 and 2020–2021.
This year’s data suggest that the ratio between median superintendent salary and median salary for a
starting teacher narrowed in almost all enrollment categories. Furthermore, the 2021–2022 ratios of
median superintendent salary by enrollment to median starting teacher salary by enrollment are now
less than those from 2015–2016.
Where numbers were sufficient, the ratios between the median base salary for a superintendent and
the median base salary for a starting teacher ranged from 1:2.6 to 1:5.
The Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance reported in 2018 that the ratio of CEO
base salary to entry level employee base salary for the 3000 small and mid-cap corporations that
comprise the Russell 3000 (excluding the 500 largest corporations in the United States) was 1:166. The
AFL-CIO reported that the 2020 ratio of CEO base salary to entry level employee base salary for the
500 largest corporations in the United States was 1:299.

Findings: Male and female superintendents were equally likely to have their contracts specify the
process, measures, and indicators to be used in formal evaluations. About 44% of superintendents
had this provision in their contract regardless of gender, whereas 56% did not. This marks a change
for females compared to one year ago (2020–2021) in which 39.2% had the provision. There was no
change for males compared to one year ago.

Findings: Where numbers were sufficient, there was a difference between racial/cultural groups
concerning the inclusion of directions or objectives from the previous year’s assessment in the
superintendents’ performance assessment. Black or African American (64.5%) and Hispanic or Latino
(64%) superintendents were more likely to have such a clause in their contract, compared to White
superintendents, but care should be taken to interpret the findings in light of a small sample size (Black
or African American n=76 and Hispanic or Latino n=53).

Findings: About 41% of superintendents had evaluations linked to student outcomes/performance
in some way—about 2% less than last year. Since 2015, percentages have fluctuated between 34.1%
and almost 43% (42.8%; 41.2%; 36.7%; 35.1%; 34.1%).

Findings: Almost 40% of superintendents had the outcomes of their formal evaluation released to
the public—no change from the previous year, but 6% higher than 2019. Only approximately 10%
have this clause as part of their negotiated contract, whereas 29% are required by state law. When
considered by gender, there was little difference in the percentage of female superintendents whose
employment agreement requires the formal evaluation to be made public (8.4%) compared to male
superintendents (9.6%).

Findings: Superintendents in districts with enrollments of 300–999 students are least likely (6.62%)
to have a negotiated clause in their contract that requires the outcome of their performance evaluation,

whereas superintendents in districts with enrollments of 5,000–9,999 are most likely (12.5%) to have
such a contract. However, such a negotiated clause remains rare.

Findings: Approximately 48% of all superintendents have a detailed agreement regarding duties and
responsibilities in their employment contract. A higher percentage of male superintendents (50.5)%
than female superintendents (40.7%) have this provision. This year’s finding is in contrast to last year
in which female superintendents were slightly more likely to have such a listing of duties and
responsibilities.

Findings: Where a sufficient number of respondents exist, there is a strong relationship between
enrollment and the formal performance evaluation being linked to student outcomes/performance.
The percentage of superintendents whose formal evaluation is linked to student outcomes increases
as enrollment increases and ranges from 18.71% for enrollments of fewer than 300 students to 80%
for enrollments of 100,000 students or more. Caution should be used when interpreting the results
for enrollments of 50,000–99,999 and 100,000 or more students due to small sample sizes.

Findings: Where numbers were sufficient, there was a difference between racial/cultural groups
concerning the inclusion of directions or objectives from the previous year’s assessment of the
superintendents’ performance assessment. Black or African American (64.5%) and Hispanic or Latino
(64%) superintendents were more likely to have such a clause in their contract compared to White
superintendents, but care should be taken to interpret the findings in light of a small sample size (Black
or African American n=76 and Hispanic or Latino n=53).

Findings: Where a sufficient number of respondents exist, there is a difference by racial/cultural
group in the percentage of superintendents whose performance evaluation is linked to student
outcomes/performance with 68% of Black or African American superintendents and 54% of Hispanic
or Latino superintendents having clauses that require their performance evaluations to be linked to
student outcomes/performances compared to 39% of White superintendents. Caution should be
taken when interpreting the results due to the smaller sample sizes for Black or African American
(n=76) and Hispanic or Latino superintendents (n=53).

Findings: Although not a common provision, where a sufficient number of respondents exist, Black
or African American superintendents are more likely (18.42%) to have their performance evaluation
made public than White (9%) and Hispanic or Latino superintendents (9.43%). However, readers
should interpret this finding with caution given the small sample size of Black or African American
superintendents (n=76) and Hispanic or Latino superintendents (n=53).

Findings: Only 8.9% of all respondents have a contract provision that allows the board to reassign
them to another role in the district. There is little difference, when considered by gender, in the
percentage of superintendents who have such a contract provision.

Findings: Approximately 46% of superintendents have a provision in their contract that includes a
contribution to an annuity by the district. The percentage of superintendents with this benefit
increased 2% compared to last year’s results and 13% since 2016 when only 33% received such a
benefit. The most common contribution is $1,000–$5,000 (15.88%) following by more than $10,000

Findings: Where a sufficient number of respondents exist, there is a relationship, by enrollment, in
the percentage of superintendents whose districts contribute to an annuity. As enrollment increases,
the percentage of superintendents with this provision increases. The percentage ranges from
approximately 24% in districts with enrollments of fewer than 300 students to approximately 62% in
districts with 10,000 to 24,999 students. Gender was not associated with enrollment in this study.

Findings: Almost 53% of superintendents receive a district contribution to life insurance apart from
the insurance benefits provided for all employees. There is a slight difference, based on gender, in the
percentage of superintendents who received a contribution to life insurance. Males are somewhat more
likely (54.4%) to have such a provision compared to females (49%). Overall, approximately 53% have
such a provision in their contract.

Findings: Where a sufficient number of respondents exist, there is a relationship between enrollment
and having a provision for post-retirement contributions to health insurance from the district. Other
than the enrollment category of 10,000–24,999, the percentage of superintendents who receive post-
retirement contributions to health insurance increases as enrollment increases.

Findings: Where a sufficient number of respondents exist, there is a relationship between enrollment
and district use of legal counsel or other outside agents in superintendent contract negotiations. In
general, the percentage of districts using legal counsel increases as enrollment increases, except in
districts with enrollments of 1,000–2,999 students.
