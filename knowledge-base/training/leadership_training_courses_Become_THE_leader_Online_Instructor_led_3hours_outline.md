The PD Training Leadership Development Training Program has been highly praised by our
business clients as the essential skills required to be a talented leader are presented in a
format that is both informative and empowering at the same time.
Through patience, persistence and hard work, anyone can become a highly effective leader.
The responsibility is on you to implement the strategies taught in this course, and to identify
and correct changes in certain behaviours which may be quite difficult. The skills required to
be a great team player are not always the same skills required to effectively lead the team.
This is why Executive Leadership Development is so highly sought after by most successful
companies.
The primary role of a leader also requires a thorough understanding of the team’s needs,
aspirations and concerns, so it is important to have excellent listening and facilitation skills
as well as highly developed abilities to coach and mentor others. This Leadership and
Development Training Program will teach you that effective leadership starts with a thorough
understanding of oneself, which then allows you to support and lead others towards
stated organisational goals.
