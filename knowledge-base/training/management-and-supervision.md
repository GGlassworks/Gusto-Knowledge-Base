                          Change Management Training Course Outline
Foreword:
Change is a constant in many of our lives. All around us, technologies, processes, people, ideas, and methods often
change, affecting the way we perform daily tasks and live our lives. This Change Management workshop will give any
leader tools to implement changes more smoothly and to have those changes better accepted. This workshop will also
give all participants an understanding of how change is implemented and some tools for managing their reactions to
change.
Change Management Training is important in today’s professional world as organisational change is more the norm
rather than the exception. More than ever, work roles and organisations are in a state of flux with changes in structure,
re-deployment, return to work, redundancy and personal crisis. Hence it is important to understand the change
management process and learn some important change management tools.
Change takes place on three different levels:

      the Individual
      the Team
      the Organisation

Organisational change management has to happen at all three levels, as they are interrelated.
This Change Management Training Program is geared toward teaching the change management process as well as
some change management tools and principles that can support managers, consultants and other change facilitators to
fulfil their mission: to initiate and sustain change processes.

                            Conflict Resolution Training Course Outline
Foreword:
Conflict is the result of people having differing needs, opinions, expectations and importantly different perspectives.
The reality of conflict is that in any human relationship it is inevitable, if handled well, conflict provides a powerful avenue
for significant growth.
Conflict resolution involves recognising and managing the particular conflict. This is an essential part of building
emotional intelligence, and nurturing relationships. Poorly handled conflict can affect both the employees and the clients
thereby impacting the company’s bottom-line. To maintain your competitive advantage, you need the entire organisation
to focus on developing conflict resolution strategies to quickly and effectively resolve conflict, while building trust and
commitment with clients and colleagues.
This Conflict Resolution Training Course provides techniques for individuals in an organisation to resolve workplace
conflict and build a common understanding and framework for working through challenging conflict situations. We have,
after much research, decided to focus on the Win-Win Approach using the three critical skills of conflict resolution –
Negotiation, Assertiveness and Persuasion. These skills will enable the participants to develop conflict resolution
strategies for quickly and effectively recognising, resolving and preventing conflict.

Outcomes:
In this course participants will:
    Gain a thorough understanding of the sources, causes and types of conflict
    Master all six phases of the conflict resolution process
    Understand the five main approaches to conflict resolution
    Learn to apply conflict resolution approaches

    Develop communication tools such as agreement frames and open questions

                         Leadership Training 2 day course Course Outline
Foreword:
Leadership Development Training has a place of great importance in today’s world as leaders are viewed as evolved
rather than born. Leaders have been traditionally viewed as “mythological creatures”, separate from the rest of humanity
and empowered by some mysterious quality that smoothes their path towards inevitable success. However, the modern
view is that through patience, persistence and hard work, therefore anyone can become a highly effective leader. The
onus is on oneself to believe and make it happen. That is the reason Executive Leadership Training is so highly sought
after by all successful companies.
Leadership development comes from within us, in the sense that deeply held values and principles provide the road map
for the way we lead, and the way other people respond. Hence it is important that a Leader must first understand and
then communicate one’s own value systems to other people. It is always the Leader’s personal value system that
sustains them in their quest, whether they are a person of impeccable morals, or quite disreputable. Hence this is an
integral part of management training as it is of critical importance to have self-awareness to lead and manage other
people.
The role of a leader starts with a thorough understanding of the team’s needs, aspirations and concerns, for which it is
important to have excellent listening and facilitation skills.
This Leadership and Influencing Skills Training Program will teach you that effective leadership starts with a thorough
understanding and congruence of the value systems of all parties.

  Be a leader with a vision, not just a manager
  Look beyond the leadership stereotypes

                           Meeting Management Course Course Outline
Foreword:
An Australian University study has shown that companies are wasting huge amounts of money on inefficient meetings.
The study conducted by the University of South Australia discovered that one in three workers admitted to falling asleep
in meetings while 87% said they daydream and 26% said they did other work.
Professor Terry Robbins-Jones, head of the University's School of Accounting and Information Systems says face-to-
face meetings are costing Australian businesses a whopping A$19bn a year. "People spend well over 50% of their time
working with other people - making it the single most expensive activity in the business world - and yet we know nothing
about it," he said.
"Bearing in mind that collaboration - including the time spent in face-to-face meetings - probably accounts for well over
half the total costs of any organisation, companies should be thinking about having a budget for it or monitoring how
effectively it operates," he added. The University of South Australia study found that 46% of executives felt meetings
were a good use of time, while 33% felt that - at best - they were fairly productive. These figures suggest that utilising a
"meeting auditor" or "collaborative advocate" could produce cost savings and increased productivity benefits.

                          Motivating Employees Course Course Outline
Foreword:
Employee Motivation is becoming ever more important in the workplace and everyone agrees that a motivated workforce
is far more likely to be a successful workforce. The happier and more professional an employee is, the better the results
they will deliver for you. Of course, every employer wants to make sure that they have a workforce who will do their best,
but this does not simply mean making the job easy for their employees. In fact, part of the problem of motivation is that
where the job is too easy, employees become complacent.
There is therefore a challenge for all employers and management in delivering the right balance between a confident,
motivated workforce and a workforce which is driven to attain goals. It can be described as a mix between the pleasure
of a comfortable working environment and the fear of failure, although in honesty it is more complicated than that
equation suggests. Regardless of how it is characterised, it is important to get the right balance in order to ensure that
you have a motivated workforce. This Employee Motivation course is designed to show participants the way to get the
best out of a confident, motivated set of employees, and to show them how to motivate that group.

Outcomes:
        Explain motivation
        Apply effective methods of staff motivation
        Interpret and discuss the psychological theories behind employee motivation
        Develop plans for more effective team motivation including making allowances for different personality types
        Set clear & defined goals as part of the motivation process
        Identify specific challenges of workplace motivation & learn how to address them

                           Supervising Others Training Course Outline
Foreword:
All too often great team members are promoted to a supervisory role without consideration that supervising requires a
completely different skill set as to that which made them stand out as part of the team. One of the hardest moves to

role is no longer on equal terms with their peers, has to earn their respect, show authority and leadership, and often has
to make unpopular decisions.
This Supervision Training Program will help supervisors become more efficient and proficient at delegating, managing
time, setting goals and expectations (for themselves and others), providing feedback, and resolving conflict. People in
supervisory roles will improve their skills, confidence and general management abilities.This supervision training will
benefit new supervisors and anyone that wants to improve their skills in supervising others to ensure productivity and
team cohesion.
This supervision training covers all the important requirements of a supervisor. Through exercises, case studies,
practical examples and clear guidelines you will develop the necessary skills and knowledge to achieve results through
the effective supervision of staff.

By the end of this course, participants will be able to:
   Set clear expectations for team members
   Set S.M.A.R.T. goals for team members that motivate and inspire dedication

                               Team Building Training Course Outline
Foreword:
An increasing number of organisations are relying on teams – project teams, product development teams, virtual teams,
and autonomous working teams to compete in a rapidly changing domestic and global market. The reason for this is the
ability of teams to perform at high levels and adapt quickly to escalating demands. Hence in today’s professional
environment, more than ever, there is great emphasis placed on team leadership skills, team communication skills and
team management styles.
Team effectiveness is enhanced by a team’s commitment to reflect and perform on-going evaluation. In addition to
evaluating accomplishments in terms of meeting specific goals, for teams to be high-performing it is essential for them to
understand their development as a team.
Hence team members need to constantly sharpen their skills as team initiatives often fail due to improper
implementation, conflict and competition. Team Leadership Skills are essential to maintain development and cohesion in
the group.
This Team Leadership Training Program will help arm Team Leaders with the skills to create and maintain successful
teams.

                   Highly Effective Management (2-days) Course Outline
Foreword:
Traditionally, middle managers make up the largest managerial layer in an organization. Middle managers are
responsible to those above them and those below them. They head a variety of departments and projects. In order for a
company to operate smoothly, it is essential that those in management be committed to the goals of the organization and
understand how to effectively execute these goals.
All managers need a framework in which to operate. Managers need to know the most effective techniques for guiding
teams, mentoring individuals, and validating the results. Without solid methods, managers will revert back to using a one-
size-fits-all approach to management that may impact on employee morale, productivity and retention.

opportunities to develop key skills that can be put into practice on a daily basis.

Although we all know that training can have many amazing benefits, sometimes it can be hard to prove those benefits

demonstrate the results that training brings.

readiness, improved communication and a more productive and engaged workforce.
This dynamic training course is available now throughout Australia, including Brisbane, Sydney, Parramatta, Melbourne,

Every organisation has its own version of the complex process new employees go through to learn skills, knowledge,

and prepared for their jobs, the faster they will be able to successfully contribute to the firm’s strategic and operational
plans.

  Define onboarding
  Know the benefits & purpose of onboarding
  Prepare for a successful onboarding program
  Identify ways to engage & follow up with employees
  Set operational expectations
