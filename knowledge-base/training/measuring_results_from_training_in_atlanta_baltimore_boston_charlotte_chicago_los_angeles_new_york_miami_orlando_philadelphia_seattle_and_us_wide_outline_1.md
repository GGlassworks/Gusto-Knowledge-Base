Training                                                                 1.0 DAY COURSE




Measuring results from professional development training is not always an
easy process, but it’s necessary to know if your company is implementing the
appropriate training programs and more importantly, getting a return from that
investment. This Measuring Results from Training course teaches you the
different ways to evaluate training outcomes and how to determine the
tangible and intangible benefits that a training program provides to your
employees.
This course includes the following: Kolb's learning styles & learning cycle,
Kirkpatrick's levels of evaluation, types and uses of various evaluation tools
(goal setting, tests, reactionary sheets & interviews), writing an evaluation
plan, how to perform a needs assessment, identifying costs, benefits & ROI on
training and much more.
This comprehensive training course is available across the U.S., including
Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Birmingham, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas,
Houston, Jackson, Los Angeles, Manhattan, Miami, New York, Orlando,
Philadelphia, San Antonio and Seattle.




What You’ll Gain:
Although we all know that training can have many amazing benefits, sometimes it can be
hard to prove those benefits and attach a dollar value to training. Some topics, like sales
training or time management, might have direct, tangible benefits. Other topics, like
communication or leadership, might have benefits that you can’t put a dollar value on.
In this course, we will learn about the different ways to evaluate training progress, and how
to use those results to demonstrate the results that training brings.
