What You’ll Gain:
Mentoring isn't what it used to be. In today's high-tech, global economy, the days of stiff
hierarchy and loyalty to the status quo are long gone.
Today's mentors understand that they have as much to gain from building close working
relationships and sharing their experience with others as they have to give. Whether you are
entering an informal arrangement or a formal training program, learn how to make mentoring
more meaningful for everyone.
