What You’ll Gain:
Do you know what motivates your staff? There are some employees who are seeking the
opportunity to be creative and innovative in their work, and other employees who prefer
routine and predictability.
The best way of finding out what motivates your staff is to simply ask them! As obvious as
this may seem, there are many managers who have overlooked having this type of
conversation with their employees, and end up making assumptions which sometimes prove
wrong - and subsequently sometimes resulting in loss of good staff.This program will help
supervisors and managers create a more dynamic, loyal, and energized workforce.
