           If your last distribution from this Coverdell ESA was before 2024, you must start with the basis in your account as of the end of
           the last year in which you took a distribution. For years before 2002, you can find that amount on the last line of the worksheet in
           the Instructions for Form 8606, Nondeductible IRAs, that you completed for that year. For years after 2001, you can find that
           amount by using the ending basis from the worksheet in Pub. 970 for that year. You can determine your basis in this Coverdell
           ESA as of December 31, 2023, by adding to the basis as of the end of that year any contributions made to that account after the
           year of the distribution and before 2024.


 Line 4.   Enter the total distributions received from this Coverdell ESA in 2024. Don't include amounts rolled over to another Coverdell
           ESA within 60 days (only one rollover is allowed during any 12-month period).
           Also, don't include excess contributions that were distributed with the related earnings (or less any loss) before the first day of
           the sixth month of the tax year following the year of the contributions.


 Line 7.   Enter the total value of this Coverdell ESA as of December 31, 2024, plus any outstanding rollovers contributed to the account
           after 2023, but before the end of the 60-day rollover period. A statement should be sent to you by January 31, 2025, for this
           Coverdell ESA showing the value on December 31, 2024.
           A rollover is a tax-free withdrawal from one Coverdell ESA that is contributed to another Coverdell ESA. An outstanding
           rollover is any amount withdrawn within 60 days before the end of 2024 (November 2 through December 31) that was rolled
           over after December 31, 2024, but within the 60-day rollover period.
