  Positional Negotiating


Both of these styles of negotiating focus
 on the positions taken by the opposing
 party. Each negotiator tries to gain
 concessions from the other party in
 order to move closer to an agreement.
 Concessions are done at the expense of
 the other party.

  negotiator to the position.

• Positional arguing engenders ill will.
            2. Build trust.
• Establish trust through preparation and
  predictability

• Show genuine concern.
• Develop rapport.
         3. Prepare to negotiate.

  strategy.
