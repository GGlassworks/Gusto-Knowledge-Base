About REACH Profiles
Whether we recognize it or not, we all take on leading roles. How we go about this can have a
tremendous impact on the lives of those we influence. Think for just a moment about the number of
people you influence in some manner, on any given day. Like it or not, for good or for ill, you have
tremendous influence! This Leading Profile report is designed to identify how you most likely influence
others, while guiding you in recognizing your distinct leading dimensions. What you do with that
recognition is up to you, but the fact that you are engaging in this self-assessment says a great deal
about your potential to be a constructive influence in the lives of those around you.
This Leading Profile report is based on your responses to the REACH Survey, a 95-question survey of
psychometric constructs designed to identify and promote key leading behaviors. While these
behaviors have been researched and practiced for generations, this report is based on a comparison
of your responses to the responses of over 30,000 participants involved in a comprehensive study of
Leading Intelligence - referred to as REACH. While some participants served in high-level Executive
positions, others were more informal organizers. Although some held positions of tremendous
responsibility and power, still others exercised authority behind the scenes in a more supportive role.
Regardless of their background, these participants had one thing in common – they exercised
influence over others and sought to do so more effectively. They represented a variety of
backgrounds, including private sector, military/government service, nonprofit and education/training as
well as geographical regions, including North America, Europe, Australia and Asia.
On the following pages, your primary Leading Profile will be described first with a high-level overview
and then with more in-depth information on the pages that follow. You will notice no mention of the
word “leadership” in this report, as it typically refers to a broad and often academic concept. Rather,
the intentional focus of this report is on the act of leading (with an emphasis on the “ing”) – meaning a
highly interactive and challenging process that engages people in moving to where the leader aims to
guide them. From the boardroom to the classroom, from the home to the headquarters, and from the
battlefield to the athletic field, the need for effective leaders is everywhere. It is a common need in
every event or activity where people gather toward a shared goal. As common as the need for leaders
is, effective leaders are far less common. With that realization, this report equips the leader with
intrapersonal awareness, to expand interpersonal influence, so that they may interactively engage with
their teams.

Leading Profile Matrix
When you completed the REACH Profile, you indicated preferences and tendencies for how you
approach common circumstances (such as at work, home, or in the community). Listed as ten specific
dimensions on subsequent pages, these preferences and tendencies combine to reveal four Leading
Profiles. Based on your responses to the REACH Survey, your primary Leading Profile (meaning the
one you tend to prefer in most situations) is best described as the: Advisor Profile.
The AdvisorProfile is most commonly recognized as being:

      more Thinking-oriented than Acting-oriented meaning that you may be more methodical and
       thoughtful about achieving your goals (this is your Achievement Drive).
      more Task-focused than People-focused meaning that you may be more objective and
       reserved in how you relate with others (this is your Relational Drive).

                    Rating: 3.69
                   (See Page 18)




Simply put, your profile suggests that you tend to be more focused on consistency and efficiency than
most people. Others may recognize you as a very rational person who is most comfortable in a
structured, organized environment. While achieving your goals, you are more likely to have a detailed
plan, while making adjustments only after careful reflection. When in a team setting, you may be most
concerned with maintaining efficiency and order.
Your REACH: The agility of your unique profile is graphically displayed as a circular zone around your
plot. This zone may be seen as the area of the matrix within which you feel most comfortable
interacting with others. The larger the “REACH”, the greater the agility with which you may adapt to
other profiles of influence when relating to people and achieving goals.
Important Note: The closer your plot is to any corner of the matrix, the more your profile will be similar
to the profile shown in the respective quadrant. The farther away your plot is from any corner, the less
likely your profile will reflect the profile indicated. The closer your plot is to the center of the matrix, the
more you may tend to exhibit characteristics of all four profiles. In reality, there will be occasions when
you may exhibit characteristics of each profile, depending on the situation.

Recognizing the Leading Profiles
While our responses may differ at times based on unique situations, most of us tend to leverage just
one of the four profiles in common situations. We can easily recognize a profile (in ourselves and
others) by observing specific markers. Identify the markers below for your primary Leading Profile
and then review how other profiles may differ in similar situations. Consider what situations might
require you to adapt your profile, especially when interacting with others who may have different
preferences and tendencies.

Influencing the Leading Profiles
Having recognized your primary Leading Profile, and learned the markers of all four profiles, the
following recommendations will equip you to interact with others most effectively. Whether building
rapport with strangers or discussing a challenging topic with an associate, communication can be
enhanced when you learn to adapt to or mirror the other profiles. Although difficult early on, practice
can make the interactions feel more natural – allowing you to recognize and collaborate with people
from all four profiles with ease.

Your 10 Leading Dimensions - the unique you
If the matrix you just reviewed provided a 30,000-foot view of your Leading Profile, these 10
dimensions are closer to the ground level.
Meaning, these dimensions shed light regarding how you tend to carry out your Leading Profile. While
you are familiar with your Advisor Profile and are most comfortable working with other Advisors (as we
are all mostly comfortable interacting within our own profile), it is important to recognize that no two
Advisors are exactly alike.
By applying these ten dimensions, you can explore and adjust how different behavior patterns can
emerge, even within a given profile.
By examining these dimensions in more detail, you can uncover ways in which your behaviors are
sources of strength, while also learning where you might benefit from further development. These ten
dimensions include five Achieving Dimensions and five Relating Dimensions.
Achieving Dimensions are the dimensions that shape your orientation towards thinking and acting as
you pursue goals:

      Intensity
      Assertiveness
      Risk Tolerance
      Adaptability
      Decision-making
Relating Dimensions are the dimensions that shape your focus on tasks and people as you pursue
goals:

      Status Motivation
      Affiliation
      Consideration
      Openness
      Self-protection

Leading Dimension: Intensity
 This dimension describes how you pursue goals, whether for personal or
 work initiatives. While some prefer to work at a steady, balanced pace,
 others show an intense, urgent pace. Most of us tend to fluctuate between
 a measured and intense focus at times.

                                                Profile tend to score in the 4-48 percentile


Leveraging Intensity

You approach most situations with focus and intensity. You push yourself to get things done, and you
are not bothered by the pressure that may rattle others. While others may slow down or retreat, you
can hold the team’s “feet to the fire” and keep focused on reaching objectives.

Developing Intensity

Although your focus allows you to thrive under pressure, your intensity level may contribute to stress
for those around you. You may need to “throttle back” at times in order to keep others engaged;
otherwise, you may out-run the group’s ability to keep up. You may find it helpful to stretch yourself by
practicing a more measured or even laid back approach during those times when a specific deadline is
not required or an urgent need is not apparent. You might also find an alternative outlet for your high
intensity (apart from your leading role) that satisfies your need to achieve.

Leading Dimension: Assertiveness
 This dimension describes how you assert your viewpoint. Some tend to be
 very quick to assert their opinions and may aspire to lead others. Others
 tend to be more reserved and defer opportunities to offer their opinion.
 Most of us seem to dislike public speaking but will assert ourselves when
 needed.

Leveraging Assertiveness

You are careful not to push your views on others. You are not likely to jump quickly into situations
without considering ramifications. Where others may constantly offer their opinions, you tend to
withhold comment until you have something meaningful to share.

Developing Assertiveness

Be mindful that your lower confidence level may cause you to appear timid at times, and you may fail
to take charge when the situation calls for your leading. When working in a collaborative setting, this
could prevent you from exercising influence over more confident individuals. You may find it helpful to
practice interjecting comments and insights in group conversations, especially around those with
whom you are most comfortable. Your reflective approach may cause others to talk over you or miss
out on your opinion. Don’t be afraid to jump into the conversation and share your perspective.

Leading Dimension: Risk Tolerance
 This dimension describes how you approach uncertain or risky situations.
 Some people seem to be natural risk takers, while others tend to be more
 cautious and careful. Most of us tend to fluctuate between avoiding and
 taking risks, depending on the situation.

Leveraging Risk Tolerance

You are cautious in the face of unfamiliar situations. You rarely act without understanding the risks
involved, and others can count on you as a voice of reason. Others may rely on you to ground their
ideas and to provide a counter point to potentially risky suggestions.

Developing Risk Tolerance

Your desire for stability and safety in the face of uncertainty allows you to act as a steadying influence
for the group. Still, your more daring team members may be concerned by what might appear to be a
hesitancy to act. In fact, there may be times when others view your cautious nature as a failure to
recognize opportunities. As you approach difficult or uncertain situations, allow others to see that your
restraint is accompanied by a willingness to act boldly when needed. Make sure your reluctance to act
amidst uncertainty does not cause you to avoid potentially rewarding opportunities.

Leading Dimension: Adaptability
 This dimension describes how you navigate change. While some prefer
 stability and a predictable environment, others enjoy frequent change and
 lots of variety. For the most part, we tend to display both reluctance and
 flexibility at times, depending on the significance of the change.

Leveraging Adaptability

You provide a steady and reliable perspective. You are not easily caught up in fads or hype, and you
require justification before an unproven concept is considered. You provide a stable and predictable
approach to issues that face the team. Others can count on you for consistency.

Developing Adaptability

Your preference for consistency and order offers stability for the group, and yet there may be times
when the status quo must be challenged by a leader. Deriving comfort from consistency may cause
you to miss out on the opportunity to experience something new. While your reliability can be
constructive, be careful not to dig in your heels to resist change unnecessarily. One of the most
challenging aspects of leading is to find ways to learn and grow, both individually and as a group.
Look for ways to make subtle adjustments to common tasks, and observe how minor changes impact
your performance and comfort level.

Leading Dimension: Decision-making
 This dimension describes how we learn and process information in making
 decisions. Some tend to rely on their intuition and experience, while others
 rely on a more analytical approach. Most of us tend to balance both
 perceptive and analytical approaches to some degree in making decisions.

Leveraging Decision-making

You carefully evaluate details and are not easily swayed by emotion or gut instinct. Others can count
on you for your analytical perspective and methodical approach. Your eye for detail and propensity for
analysis provide a great check and balance for the team’s decision-making.

Developing Decision-making

Making decisions based on a careful analysis of available information allows you to identify issues and
concerns that others may miss. This promotes greater accuracy and precision in decision-making.
However, there may be situations in which your experience alone is adequate to inform your decision-
making progress. Be careful not to dismiss the value of insight and perception offered by others who
may not share your more logical approach. Watch out for "analysis paralysis" which may cause you to
undervalue the benefit of gut instinct and experience, especially when time is of the essence.

Leading Dimension: Affiliation
 This dimension describes how we collaborate with others in getting things
 done. While some of us prefer to go it alone and work independently,
 others are much more comfortable when they can work together. Most of
 us tend to work independently or collectively at times, based on the
 circumstances.

                                                 Profile tend to score in the 12-58 percentile


Leveraging Affiliation

You work well as an individual and you don’t seek much support in getting things done. Others can rely
on you to do your part, without needing their guidance. You are not afraid to ask the tough questions,
and your independent approach will help the team to avoid the perils of groupthink.

Developing Affiliation

Collaboration is essential for effective teamwork, although you may find it easier to make most
decisions on your own. You do not feel the need to involve others in every aspect of your work, and
yet, some goals simply cannot be accomplished without help. At times, others may perceive your
preference for independence as a need to control the team or to go your own way. As a leader, others
will expect you to act without them at times, but synergy will be impacted if you fail to involve them in
brainstorming, implementing new plans, and reviewing performance outcomes. Discipline yourself to
gain the perspective of the team before acting.

Leading Dimension: Consideration
 This dimension describes how we recognize the feelings and interests of
 those around us. While some of us go out of our way to learn how we can
 help others, some of us tend to approach others more formally or
 objectively. Most of us tend to fluctuate between sensitive and objective
 approaches.

                                                Profile tend to score in the 7-53 percentile


Leveraging Consideration

You tend to remain objective where others may become emotionally involved in making decisions or
solving problems. Others can rely on you for an impartial perspective. Your objectivity can provide
great balance in approaching complex problems and your desire to stay on-task can keep the team
moving along.

Developing Consideration

At times your objective approach may be viewed as cold or harsh by more sensitive team members.
While you may be reluctant to reach out to others in need of encouragement, such a nurturing
response may be the most effective action you can take at times. Watch closely for signs that team
members appear down or disheartened, and take care to soften your comments as you remain on-
task. Others will appreciate that you recognize and consider their feelings, and you will be more likely
to prevent smaller issues from becoming insurmountable problems.

Leading Dimension: Openness
 This dimension describes your interest in sharing personal information with
 others. While some tend to place a high value on privacy and formality,
 others are much more open in their communication. Most of us tend to be
 quiet at times, and open up in others, depending on the circumstances.

                                               Profile tend to score in the 8-54 percentile


Leveraging Openness

You carefully control your emotions and you rarely discuss personal matters. You don’t intrude into
others’ personal lives and can be counted on to protect confidentiality. Where others may rely on small
talk and bonding activities to keep their interest, you are more likely to stay focused on the task at
hand.

Developing Openness

While your professional demeanor indicates formality, this may cause a challenge when it comes to
building rapport with others. Your reluctance to open up to the group may prevent you from engaging
with its members. Group cohesion can be threatened if members are discouraged from sharing their
personal interests. Although those who know you well may see your personal side at times, new
acquaintances may view your approach as aloof or even cold. Watch for signs that group members
may avoid sharing information with you, due to perceptions regarding your approachability.

Leading Dimension: Status Motivation
 This dimension describes how we relate to others as we accomplish goals.
 While some tend to thrive in competitive settings where they are rewarded
 for their individual performance, others prefer cooperative efforts and team
 rewards. Most of us tend to enjoy both opportunities from time to time.

                                                 Profile tend to score in the 24-84 percentile


Leveraging Status Motivation

You work well with others in accomplishing goals, and you are quick to share credit for
accomplishments. Others view you as a helpful contributor rather than competitor. You will find ways
to draw out others’ strengths for the benefit of the team. Where others prefer to compete, you find that
you can accomplish more through cooperation.

Developing Status Motivation

Since you may be most motivated by private recognition, there may be times when you are reluctant to
pursue a competitive endeavor (where individual performance is singled out). Still, some situations
may call for you to pursue a goal, while competing for resources and/or the ultimate reward. Look for
opportunities to leverage other team members’ competitive drive by identifying a specific target or goal
for the group to pursue together. When your efforts are successful, point back to the team’s efforts and
share the recognition accordingly.

Leading Dimension: Self-protection
 This dimension describes how you tend to view others’ intentions or
 reliability. While some are comfortable giving others the benefit of the
 doubt, others will be inclined to scrutinize things more carefully. For the
 most part, we tend to balance trust with skepticism in common situations.

                                                Profile tend to score in the 38-92 percentile


Leveraging Self-protection

You tend to give others the benefit of the doubt until you are proven wrong. You like to find the best in
people and will go out of your way to seek others’ input. Your trusting nature will help to break down
barriers in bonding and communication, especially in the early stages of team development.

Developing Self-protection

There may be situations when your trusting nature may be mistaken for vulnerability. In fact, you may
be naïve at times regarding the reason behind others’ actions or more discrete sources of conflict. You
may fail to appreciate the need for some scrutiny and thus it may take you longer to see the potential
for hidden agendas. As the adage suggests, you might be best served by trusting, but verifying. Learn
to ask questions of others, not as a way of exercising suspicion, but simply to verify that your
expectations are in line with reality.

REACH Skills Introduction
As you have reviewed the dimensions of your Leading Profile, you have likely noticed that certain
dimensions seem to make some skills more comfortable for you, while others seem to make the same
skills more challenging. This is because each skill is influenced by more than one of your leading
dimensions, meaning that there can be a “tug-of-war” at times as we approach certain skills. Simply
put, we may feel quite comfortable performing a skill in some situations and less so in others.
Since your leading effectiveness is typically evaluated by how well you perform key skills, it is helpful
to consider your relative comfort level with each one. Competencies that are more comfortable can be
a source of strength for you, while skills that are less comfortable can become a focal point for your
ongoing development. Whether you are working independently to develop your leading potential, or
are being guided via a formal program, knowing where to focus your efforts can help you to make
lasting improvements.
The following page lists various skills you might be expected to perform routinely in a leading role, as
well as your likely comfort level or preference for performing each one. Higher scores indicate you may
feel very comfortable performing the skill (the skill tends to come naturally for you), while lower scores
indicate you may experience difficulty performing the skill (the skill may require an intentional ‘stretch’
on your part). For any skill, you may perform better under some circumstances, while feeling less
comfortable in others. For those skills where you may have a lower comfort level, consider how you
might stretch individual Leading Dimensions (pages 7-16) to strengthen your effectiveness. This can
be particularly helpful in a team setting, as you recognize and develop skills that can integrate within
the existing strengths and needs of the team.

Developing Your Leading Profile
Generally speaking, Advisors are characterized by an instructive or administrative approach to leading
due to a more methodical Achievement Drive and a more guarded Relational Drive (see page 3). As a
result of this interaction, you may tend to rely on your knowledge and expertise to influence others.
Rather than attempting to gain emotional buy-in, you tend to advise others by leveraging your formal
authority or by issuing specific guidance or instruction. Given your desire for competence and
precision, your concern for formality and structure will be more readily apparent than an interest in
flexibility or in building relationships. At times, this may cause strain with others who do not share your
concern for efficiency or who prefer a more nurturing approach.

Ideal Team Environment

The Advisor’s ideal working environment would best be described as one in which the leader
establishes effective procedures and advises team members on how to comply with the organization’s
directives. In such an environment, the leader assigns specific tasks, while expecting followers to
adhere to established guidelines. In this culture, ‘competence is king’, and the leader works to keep
followers trained and prepared for their respective assignments.
Advisors tend to enjoy developing expertise in themselves and others. As such, you may be most
motivated when your efforts are focused on learning new things and then instructing others. When
there is no clear structure or routine, you are likely to intervene in hopes of developing well-defined
processes. Frankly, you are likely at your best when your knowledge and experience can be utilized in
guiding the team away from pitfalls and errors that are preventable with a well-planned approach.

Potential De-railers

One important note of caution is worthy of mention. While each Leading Profile may be characterized
by key attributes, some of these can actually derail one’s success if taken too far. In other words,
every strength in your style can become a weakness if over-utilized or if applied within the wrong
context. For example, while contemplation is most often considered a strength of the Advisor Profile,
this can derail your effectiveness if you fail to take decisive or timely action when conditions warrant,
especially during times of turmoil or uncertainty. A critical challenge for you (as for all leaders) is to
recognize your strengths and learn to apply them in the proper context and to the appropriate degree.
Advisors tend to expect themselves and others to seek perfection in their work. So, where others may
be looking only at the bottom line, you may be far more concerned with the incremental details and
processes involved. While this focus on administering an effective process can help avoid mistakes, it
can also cause you to ‘miss the forest for the trees’ at times. For Advisors like you, it may be said that
nothing gets by you, but this may also mean that you can get lost in relatively minor details.

Easing Tension

There may be times when your desire to mitigate conflict sources can cause you to overlook less
obvious, ‘big picture’ concerns. Be mindful that there are times when a single source of conflict must
be addressed within the context of a larger, often interpersonal issue. Watch for signs that your
approach may be too logical, preventing you from appreciating the relational cause and effect of some
conflicts.
You may find it helpful to weigh up the urgency of a conflict before choosing a course of action. While
you may feel inclined to isolate or avoid a source of conflict altogether, there may be times when a
more immediate approach is the best option. By more directly confronting its source, you may prevent
a relatively minor issue from growing into a larger concern. Group members will be more likely to seek
out your guidance when they are confident you will take decisive action when necessary.
