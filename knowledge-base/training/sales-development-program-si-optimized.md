Sales Development Program
(Construction Sales):
Full-time
Program Overview:
The Sales Development Program (SDP) prepares recently graduated professionals for a career in
technical sales in the construction industry. Through extensive training, program participants will
learn technical sales methodologies and techniques and gain knowledge of Siemens’ products,
technology and values as related to the Siemens Smart Infrastructure. The portfolio includes low
and medium voltage electrical products utilized in residential, commercial, and utility applications.

The SDP is a full-time position that is crafted to build a balanced career path with Siemens.
This 12-month program is divided into two rotations. The first 6-month period is located in our
Atlanta, GA office. From there, participants will be placed in field rotations based on business need.
SDP graduates have the opportunity to expand their career further within the Smart Infrastructure
organization. Sales positions following graduation may vary based on availability and locations.


Examples of Past Rotations and Projects:
• Learning the Siemens global footprint and how Siemens contributes to the global infrastructure
• Learning about the industry, channel, and market
• Training on core selling skills and confirmed methodologies
• Establishing internal and external contacts
• Access to and network with Siemens’ senior decision makers and key leaders
