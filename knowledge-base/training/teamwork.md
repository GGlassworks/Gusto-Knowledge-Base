Skills to Pay the Bills




                                                         Teamwork
             Teamwork is an essential part of workplace success. Like a basketball team working together to set up
             the perfect shot, every team member has a specific role to play in accomplishing tasks on the job.
             Although it may seem as if one player scored the basket, that basket was made possible by many
             people’s planning, coordination, and cooperation to get that player the ball. Employers look for people
             who not only know how to work well with others, but who understand that not every player on the
             team can or will be the one who gets the ball. When everyone in the workplace works together to
             accomplish goals, everyone achieves more.


             Teamwork involves building relationships and working with other people using a number of important
             skills and habits:


             •    Working cooperatively
                                                                                     The ability to work as part of a team is
             •    Contributing to groups with ideas, suggestions, and effort         one of the most important skills in
             •    Communication (both giving and receiving)                          today’s job market. Employers are

             •    Sense of responsibility                                            looking for workers who can contribute
                                                                                     their own ideas, but also want people
             •    Healthy respect for different opinions, customs, and
                                                                                     who can work with others to create
                  individual preferences                                             and develop projects and plans.
             •    Ability to participate in group decision-making


             When employees work together to accomplish a goal, everyone benefits. Employers might expect to
             “see” this in action in different ways. For example, team members in the workplace plan ahead and
             work cooperatively to assign tasks, assess progress, and deliver on time. They have professional
             discussions during which differing approaches and opinions might be shared and assessed in a respectful
             manner. Even when certain employees end up with tasks that were not their first choices, jobs get done
             with limited complaints because it is in the spirit of teamwork and with the overall goal in mind. A
             leader or manager may often serve as the teamwork facilitator. In this case, team members participate
             respectfully in discussion, carry out assigned tasks, and defer to the leader in the best interest of the
             goal. Consensus is wonderful, but not always possible, and an assigned leader will often support and
             facilitate the decision-making necessary for quality teamwork to exist.


             The activities in this section seek to teach participants about the importance of teamwork to workplace
             success and the specific role each individual on a team may play. Participants will learn about positive
             teamwork behavior and discover how their own conduct can impact others on a team. The section also
             discusses possible obstacles to teams working successfully and offers the opportunity to build
             constructive strategies for overcoming these challenges.

Note to facilitators: Learning the value of teamwork and becoming an effective member of a team is
an important first step to developing leadership skills. For disconnected youth, especially those with
underlying disabilities, the development of these skills is critical. Young people without a connection
to work or school typically have had limited exposure to positive and proactive support systems, or a
true sense of the essence of the proactive support of a community. Affording young people
experiences through which they learn to rely on themselves and others is an important factor in the
development of a productive teamwork mentality. If working with disconnected youth and/or youth
with disabilities, use these activities to bridge teamwork skills as a stepping-stone to leadership
development.

                                            11. There is No “I” in Team
             JUST THE FACTS: The purpose of this activity is to enrich participants’ understanding of what it means
             to be part of a team and why being a good team player is important for career success.


                          Time
                          15-20 minutes


                          Materials
                          •   Chart paper or sentence strips with markers and/or Activity 11 printed out for each
                              participant


                          Directions
                          Choose and display five “teamwork” quotes (see Activity 11). This can be done on chart
                          paper, using the accompanying worksheet, writing quotes on sentence strips, or reading
                          each quote aloud. What is important here is the quote – and not necessarily who said the
                          quote.


                          Ask participants to choose the quote they like best. Divide the larger group into smaller
                          groups according to the chosen quote (i.e., all participants who liked quote #1, etc.).
                          Participants should spend approximately two minutes discussing the quote and coming to
                          consensus on the reason they liked it the best. One member of each team should be
                          prepared to offer the group’s feedback and reflection.


                          For another, more hands-on version of this activity, write each of the quotes on sentence
                          strips. Cut the sentence strips into individual words or manageable chunks/phrases. Have
                          groups work together to arrange the words/phrases into the correct order.


                          Conclusion
                          Tell participants that employers rate the ability to be a “team player” as one of the most
                          important qualities and characteristics of their current (and future) employees (i.e., the
                          job candidate). Ask why this is might be so. Elicit responses and an interactive discussion.


                          Journaling Activity
                          A friend comes to you seeking advice. He got into trouble at work for not being a team
                          player. He really likes his job and isn’t quite sure what to do. What suggestions would
                          you give to your friend to help him improve? How might he respond to his boss?

Extension Activity
Have participants create their own personal quotes about teamwork…why it is important…
what can be accomplished…etc. The quote should be one that encourages peers to gain a
better understanding and perspective on the importance of teamwork AND why it is often a
core value shared by many different cultures, populations, and groups.


Offer the opportunity for participants to research and share proverbs related to teamwork
from their own cultures.




                                                                                            59

12. I’ll Give You Some of Mine if You Give Me Some of Yours

JUST THE FACTS: Part of becoming a functional member of a team is learning to understand what you
bring to the group and what you might need from others. This exercise is designed to help participants
begin to identify their individual strengths and needs regarding teamwork.


           Time
           30 minutes



           Materials
           •   Activity 12
           •   Pens or pencils
           •   Optional: Chart paper and markers


           Directions
           Introduce this activity by reflecting on some of the quotes discussed in Activity 11 (if you
           have not completed Activity 11, choose some of the quotes to discuss with the group – and
           offer a brief discussion on their meaning).


           Ask participants for a list of some of the characteristics they think make up a good team
           player. This might be phrased as follows: “What does it take from each person on a team
           to make a team really work?”


           Students will be completing an individual inventory of the skills they possess related to
           teamwork. This inventory is for personal reflection and need not be shared.


           Conclusion
           As part of the concluding activity, ask participants to share one of their identified areas of
           strengths – and one area they would like to improve. This discussion allows each to hear
           from others their areas of strength and need. This process may help those in need of
           assistance identify who might be able to offer it.



           Journaling Activity
           Consider your score on the Elements of Teamwork inventory. Were you pleased with your
           results? What are some of the areas you would like to improve? How will you attempt to
           do this?




                                                                                                            61
Skills to Pay the Bills




                          Extension Activity
                          Have participants ask someone they know and trust to rate them using a blank copy of
                          Activity 12. Were the scores/checks similar or different? What does this tell them? Does
                          this change any of the notes made related to skills to improve?


                          Have participants redesign the activity with words and/or actions that better describe the
                          elements of teamwork from their perspective. Another option is for participants to
                          schedule a meeting with an employer and get additional input as to how an employer
                          might identify or describe the characteristics listed.

Consider your answers:

Did you have mostly “not so confident” checked off?
If so, you are still developing your confidence as a team player. These skills often take some time to
develop – so don’t worry. It might be helpful to reach out to someone you know and trust to help you
focus on developing a plan for working on some of the skills in which you would like to be more
confident. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Asking for help when you need it is another great skill of a
productive team player.


Did you have mostly “sort of confident” checked off?
If so, you are pretty confident in your teamwork skills – but could probably use a little extra support or
development in a few areas. Invite someone close to you (someone you know and trust), to work with
you on the areas you would like to improve. Most people would be really happy to help you! Learning
the strategies to become a good team member takes time, energy, and dedication.


Did you have mostly “really confident” checked off?
If so, you are truly confident in your ability to be a good team player. That’s great! Figure out an area
or two where you would like to continue to see improvement (since we should always be striving to be
the best we can be) and develop a plan for how to further grow those skills. Also try to offer support to
someone you know who might be struggling with building his or her own level of teamwork confidence.


Now consider your teamwork skills confidence levels:

                          13. The Good, the Bad, and the Reasonable
             JUST THE FACTS: Teamwork can be tough. Dealing with different personalities and compromise is not
             necessarily easy. So, what do you do when you are part of a team and there are barriers to the team’s
             success? This could be a sports team, a team at work, or a group working on a school or community
             project. The purpose of this activity is to engage participants in a discussion of some of the barriers to
             effective teamwork and the strategies they may be able to put in place to create positive outcomes.


                          Time
                          25 minutes



                          Materials
                          •   Flip chart and markers
                          •   Dry spaghetti and marshmallows
                          •   Optional: Timer

                          Directions
                          Ask participants if teamwork is ALWAYS easy. (Most likely you will receive “no” answers).
                          Delve deeper and ask about some of the reasons why teams sometimes don’t work or what
                          makes teamwork so difficult at times. Write these answers on the flip chart. Answers may
                          include: inconsistent team players, time issues, compatibility, differences in
                          communication styles (both giving and receiving), lack of trust, no clear goal, etc.


                          Next, divide participants into groups of four or more. Ask each group to elect a team
                          leader for this activity. Give each group a supply of spaghetti and marshmallows. Tell the
                          group they will have 15 minutes to work together to create the tallest freestanding
                          structure possible. Before you say, “go,” tell the teams that their team leaders may only
                          supervise and offer instructions. He or she may not physically participate in this activity.


                          Conclusion
                          After 15 minutes, evaluate the structures. Usually the highest structure has a solid and
                          wide foundation. Discuss with participants what it means to have a solid foundation – and
                          why laying a solid foundation is important (and the core of an effective team).

Use the following questions for additional discussion:

1. How did your team work together? What specifically worked well? What difficulties did
    you experience?

2. Besides the team leader, what role did each person play in the group? How was each
    person helpful to the end goal?

3. Was it a plus or a minus that the team leader was not able to physically participate in
    the activity? How did the team leader feel about his or her level of participation?

4. What would you do differently if given a second chance at this activity?


Journaling Activity
You are the leader of a team at work. What type of leader would you like to be – one that
gets involved and works with the team or one that tells the team what to do? Explain your
choice.


Extension Activity
Have participants interview no fewer than 20 of their peers and ask two simple
questions:

1. What is the best part of working on a team?

2. What is the most difficult part of working on a team?


Participants should be instructed to bring their results back to the larger group. The larger
group should then examine the most common difficulties described and come up with
solutions to turn these difficulties into successes.

                                14. How Many Shapes Does it Take?
             JUST THE FACTS: It takes all types of team members to create a balanced, cohesive team. This
             activity will give participants the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the roles different
             people play on a team and the importance of each role.


                          Time
                          20 minutes



                          Materials
                          •   Five large pieces of paper, each with one of the following shapes drawn: square,
                              rectangle, circle, triangle, and squiggle



                          Directions
                          Before beginning this activity, place each of the five shapes in a different location in of the
                          room. Ensure there is enough room for participants to move around for this activity.
                          Discuss the fact that teams are all made up of people who perform different roles. Think
                          about a sports team (football, basketball, soccer, hockey, etc.). What might happen if one
                          basketball player hogged the ball all of the time? What might happen if the quarterback
                          tried to run the ball all of the time instead of passing? So, it takes all different types of
                          players to make an efficient and winning team, right?


                          Now, switch gears. Tell participants that not only does it take all different types of players
                          to make a team effective; it takes all kinds of shapes, too.


                          Say something to the effect of: “I want you all to look around the room. Five different
                          shapes are hanging up. The shapes are a square, a rectangle, a circle, a triangle, and a
                          squiggle. What if I told you that knowing whether you, your co-workers and friends are
                          squares, rectangles, circles, triangles, or squiggles could help you build better teams and
                          better careers?”


                          Ask participants to stand up and take a few moments to think about the shape they like
                          best or find most appealing. Then ask participants to walk over to that shape.


                          Once everyone has chosen their personal shape, use the information in Activity 14 to tell
                          them a little bit about each shape’s “personality.” In fact, when you are finished with this
                          activity, many participants will want to have a copy of what the shapes mean.

Conclusion
Discuss the following questions with the group:
•   Do you think people have the characteristics of more than one shape?
•   Why do you think it is important to have all different shapes working on the same
    team? Offer some of the information below, if appropriate:
        -    The Square, Rectangle, and Triangle are all convergent. This mean they are
             working TOWARDS something specific and finite, and they do it in a logical and
             systematic way. But they might be lacking in personal creativity.
        -    The Circle and Squiggle are divergent. This mean they are creative,
             extroverted, and intuitive. They will reach out around them into new areas and
             to other people. But they aren’t particularly systematic or dependable.


Journaling Activity
Do you think it is easy or difficult for different types of personalities to work together?
Why is it important to not only understand how you work best, but to learn how others
work best?


Extension Activity
Spend some time with participants to explore different types of personality assessments for
the purpose of team building. Have students take different assessments and determine the
validity of each. Research further and find out which occupations are best suited for which
types of personalities.


Another option is to have participants think about and describe their favorite sport and
compare players on those teams with the different roles found in the workplace. Examples
might include: boss – coach; customer – fan; player – co-worker; etc. See how many
different types of comparisons can be made and how important it is for all of these roles to
work together in order to create harmony on a team.

                                            Activity 14. Which Shape are You?
             There are some people who believe there are five basic personality types, and each type tends to
             prefer a different shape. Knowing whether you, your co-workers and friends are squares, rectangles,
             circles, triangles, or squiggles just might help you build better careers, teams, and friendships. Here is
             what each shape might say about you – and how you can recognize other people for their shapes.


             If you are a SQUARE: You are an organized, logical, and hardworking person who likes structure and
             rules. But sometimes you have trouble making decisions because you always want more information.
             You feel most comfortable in a stable environment with clear directions on what to do. You tend to like
             things that are regular and orderly. You will work on a task until it is finished, no matter what.


             How to spot a square: They appear to move “straight,” use precise or specific gestures, love routine, and are
             very concerned with detail. They are also very neat in their appearance and their personal workspace. They do a
             lot of planning and are always prompt.


             If you are a RECTANGLE: You are a courageous (brave), exciting, and inquisitive explorer who always
             searches for ways to grow and change. You enjoy trying things you’ve never done before and love
             asking questions that have never been asked. You like structure, and will often be the person to be
             sure things are done the proper way, taking all rules and regulations into consideration. When you are
             given a task you will start organizing it to be sure it can be done in the most systematic way.


             How to spot a rectangle: These people often have “fleeting eyes and flushed faces.” They also tend to giggle and
             they like variety. For example, they’ll come into work early or late — but not on time. And those who have offices
             tend to be disorganized with a mishmash of furniture.


             If you are a TRIANGLE: You are a born leader who’s competitive, confident, and can make decisions.
             You also like recognition. You are goal oriented and enjoy planning something out and then doing it
             (you are motivated by the accomplishment). You will tend to look at big long-term issues, but might
             forget the details. When given a task you set a goal and work on a plan for it. American business has
             traditionally been run by triangles and, although usually men, more women are taking those roles
             today.


             How to spot a triangle: They have powerful voices, love to tell jokes, and they play as hard as they work. They
             also tend to be stylish dressers.


             If you are a CIRCLE: You are social and communicative. There are no hard edges about you. You
             handle things by talking about them and smoothing things out with everybody. Communication is your
             first priority. When given a task, you will want to talk about it. You are a “people person,” with lots of
             sympathy and consideration for others. You listen and communicate well and are very perceptive about
             other people’s feelings. You like harmony and hate making unpopular decisions.

How to spot a circle: They are friendly, nurturing, persuasive, and generous. They tend to be relaxed and smile a
lot. They’re talkative, but have a mellow voice. They also have a full laugh and like to touch others on the
shoulder and arm.


If you are a SQUIGGLE: You are “off-the-wall” and creative. You like doing new and different things
most of the time and get bored with regularity. When given a task, you will come up with bright ideas
about to do it. But you don’t think in a deliberate pattern from A to B to C. Instead, you tend to jump
around in your mind, going from A to M to X.


How to spot a squiggle: They can be “flashy,” dramatic, and extremely creative – and they don’t like highly
structured environments. Both men and women squiggles tend to be funny and very expressive. They also have
great intuition. Most performers and writers are squiggles.

                                              15. Teamwork on the Job
             JUST THE FACTS: The purpose of this activity is to help participants understand how teamwork is
             managed on the job – both from the perspective of the boss and from the perspective of the employee.


                          Time
                          15 - 30 minutes


                          Materials
                          •       Copies of Activity 15a or 15b, depending on your time frame



                          Directions
                          This exercise offers two different activities. You may choose one or both, depending on
                          time. One is scenario based and one is a role play.

                          Activity 15a: For this activity, read (aloud or independently) the library scenario. Discuss
                          as a group what Shawn (the librarian) did well, and what she could have done differently.
                          How might she handle herself in the future? Discuss how Nathaniel (the boss) should
                          handle this situation. Consider the fact that he probably wants to help Shawn to improve
                          and not necessarily punish her.


                          Activity 15b: For this activity, request volunteers to act out a role play. Allow a few
                          minutes for the actors to read through the scene so they know what their character is like.
                          After the scene is read aloud, ask the following questions:

                          • What was the real problem at the coffee shop?
                          • What could Jarrod and/or Steffy have done differently?
                          • Do you agree with how the manager handled the situation?
                          • What might you have done in this situation?


                              Conclusion
                              The importance of teamwork is undeniable. Ask the group to come up with a list of the
                              benefits of teamwork and to illustrate or give examples of each. If the group has trouble
                              coming up with a list, use the following as conversation starters:

                              •     Support - Teamwork leads to camaraderie between team members. This will not only
                                    lead to better social relationships, but can also act as a support when things go wrong.

                              •     Varied skills – Different team members bring with them different skills.

                              •     Distribution of work - Distributing work not only reduces each individual’s burden, but
                                    also increases responsibility and ensures better commitment to completing the task
                                    individually and as a whole.

•   Creativity - Different people have different skills and possess different perspectives.
    Therefore any activity that involves teamwork benefits from the various creative
    thoughts and inspirations of different people.

•   Accomplish faster – People working together will tend to complete a project faster
    than if one person was working alone.


Journaling Activity
Think about a time when you were part of a group/team and things worked really well, and
a time when things didn’t work out so well. What were the situations and what made the
differences?


Extension Activity
Consider different jobs in your community. Arrange for field trips to some local job sites
where participants can ask both managers and employees a few questions about teamwork
(or ask an employer and employees to come in to talk about the impact of teamwork on
the job). Alternatively, participants can do this independently and then share their
experiences with the larger group.


Work with participants to develop a single set of questions to ask of managers and
employees. Questions should be focused on the importance of teamwork and what
happens when one or more chooses not to be a team player.

                                         Activity 15A. Teamwork on the Job


             SCENARIO:


             Shawn works in a library. She and three other co-workers have been tasked to work together on a
             project. Shawn turns in the completed product, but she completed it without input or help from the
             others. Shawn said it was really tough to find time to meet together. She did text the others (asking
             about working together), but got no responses. Her supervisor, Nathaniel, knows that she is a promising
             young librarian who wants to advance to a leadership position. Nathaniel also believes that Shawn has
             the potential to be a good leader, but feels she is impatient when it comes to working with others.




             DISCUSSION:

             • What did Shawn do well?
             • What could she have done differently?
             • How might she handle herself in the future?
             • How should Nathaniel handle this situation?
             • Consider the fact that he probably wants to help Shawn to improve and not necessarily punish her.

                            Activity 15a. Teamwork on the Job

Narrator: Five characters will role play a situation to determine whose job it is to restock the
condiments at the coffee bar.


Characters:             Jarrod          Steffy
                        Pam             John
                        Manager         Narrator


Jarrod: It wasn’t my job! It was Steffy’s job! The policy around here is that the new employee
restocks cream and sugar station. She’s the newest employee. It’s her job!


Steffy: I don’t get to work until 10:00. By the time I get here, the station should already be stocked.
Otherwise, customers won’t have the stuff they need for their coffee.


Pam: You’re just trying to get out of doing your job.


Steffy: No! Jarrod gets here at 7:00. He should already have it done by the time I get here.


Jarrod: You’re the newest employee.


Steffy: What’s your problem?


Jarrod: What’s your problem?


Steffy: I do my job.


John: But you’re the newest employee. It’s your job to restock.


Narrator: Voices are getting louder.


Steffy: But Jarrod gets here earlier. I am only trying to think about our customers.


Pam: Are you just trying to get out of your job?


Jarrod: You’re impossible.


Steffy: No, you are!


Manager: Okay, okay! What’s the problem? Steffy, continue restocking the condiment station. Jarrod,
go ring up the customers.


                                                                                                           75

             Narrator: Both are taking a break from each other to calm down. Later in the day, the manager speaks
             to Jarrod and Steffy.


             Manager: Steffy, Jarrod is right. The new person stocks the cream and sugar station.


             Steffy: So you mean Jarrod shouldn’t have to do this anymore?


             Jarrod: Told you!


             Manager: Jarrod! On the other hand, that rule was made when everyone came to work at the same
             time. However, since Steffy doesn’t come into work until later in the day, the customers have a right
             to have a fully stocked station.


             Jarrod: So Steffy doesn’t have to do this job either?


             Steffy: No, I get it! Whoever comes in earliest should restock the station from the night before.


             Jarrod: Okay, so I don’t have to restock the station all day? Just replenish from the night before.
             Steffy should then do it when she comes in – and then throughout her shift?


             Manager: Exactly! Also, I would like you two to start treating each other with a little respect. It’s good
             to have a sense of humor. What happened to yours? Every customer and employee that comes in here
             deserves to be treated with courtesy. Okay? And, by the way, the customer is always right and always
             comes first.


             Narrator: (Next day) Their voices are calm and respectful.


             Steffy: Jarrod, I am here now. I’ll finish those. Why don’t you go take a break?


             Jarrod: Okay, thanks! I think I will. Hey look, there’s a whole new kind of sugar that just came in. The
             boxes are in the back. I thought you might want to know.


             Steffy: Thanks, Jarrod.
